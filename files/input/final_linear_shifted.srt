00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:30,500
{\an8}WARNING

4
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,402
Is this thing on?

5
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,560
Can you hear me?

6
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:23,734
Okay, it’s good.

7
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,205
Everything’s working.

8
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,679
You, watching this.

9
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,925
Yeah, you there.

10
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,219
You have been chosen.

11
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:41,251
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

12
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:48,936
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

13
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:54,741
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.

14
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,533
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.

15
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,203
It keeps moving forward.

16
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:10,296
That is why I have to
create this record now.

17
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:14,709
If something should
happen to me, I—

18
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:20,327
Never mind.

19
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,422
Back to the story.

20
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:31,393
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

21
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:36,734
Such as medicine, pharmacy, and archaeology—

22
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:43,100
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

23
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,878
That’s how it looks on the outside.

24
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:49,615
Right, that’s the cover.

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,175
Now, listen carefully.

26
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:58,365
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

27
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:06,786
And created our branches around the world...

28
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,137
That secret is...

29
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,776
The Stone Mask.

30
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:40,279
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

31
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:47,879
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

32
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:54,362
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

33
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:03,622
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

34
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,370
It all began in the 13th century.

35
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:12,485
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

36
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,324
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

37
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:27,347
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

38
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:29,371
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

39
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:34,141
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

40
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,926
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

41
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:39,734
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>

42
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:38,458
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

43
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,352
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>

44
00:04:39,758 --> 00:04:43,329
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

45
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
{\an8}<i>(Eternal!)</i>

46
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:43,638
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,466
<i>Taken in this hand</i>

48
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,461
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

49
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:53,416
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

50
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,223
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

51
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:53,987
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

52
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,138
<i>Blood of the living</i>

53
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:55,663
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

54
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,886
<i>Life is power</i>

55
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,365
{\an8}<i>(We sacrifice!)</i>

56
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,779
<i>The power in this hand</i>

57
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,603
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,044
<i>(We are children of the sun!)</i>

59
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:10,426
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

60
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:17,747
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

61
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:25,838
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

62
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:29,951
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

63
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,423
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

64
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:39,042
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

65
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:47,883
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

66
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:55,322
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

67
00:05:55,322 --> 00:06:00,462
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,331
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

69
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:10,004
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

70
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:12,732
Wot have we here!

71
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,289
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

72
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:20,559
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

73
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,613
-Hang on...

74
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,581
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
-Wait!

76
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,464
I said wait!

77
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:27,924
Yahoo!

78
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:31,767
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

79
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,976
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

80
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,758
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

81
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,426
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

82
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:46,785
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

83
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,883
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

84
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,991
What the—

85
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:55,381
Just a creepy mask!

86
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,804
Don’t need that!

87
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:57,548
Darling!

88
00:06:57,572 --> 00:06:57,975
What?!

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,867
In the carriage! A baby survived!

90
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,431
A baby?! Leave it there!

91
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,511
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

92
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,281
Oh...

93
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:09,675
Well, isn’t this a nice ring? I’ll take that!

94
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,128
-What are you doing?

95
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:14,579
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

96
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,048
Have a look!

97
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,590
A pocket watch too!

98
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,368
Nice teeth!

99
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:26,028
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

100
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,393
That’s enough!

101
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:30,963
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

102
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:33,533
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

103
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,663
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.

104
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,384
You... Did you rescue us...?

105
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,201
Are my wife and son...?

106
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:47,201
She croa—

107
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:54,471
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

108
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,888
Go get him!

109
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,962
So this too is fate...

110
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:08,267
I want to express my gratitude
to you for saving my life...

111
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,558
My name is Joestar...

112
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,940
I will never forget your kindness!

113
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:18,860
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

114
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:21,814
Dario Brando!

115
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:40,366
And so the years flow by until 1880.

116
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,287
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

117
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:51,558
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

118
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:53,567
{\an8}They were caught up in a dream!

119
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,086
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

120
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:02,188
{\an8}Their hands were reaching out!

121
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:09,128
<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride
in our queen, we pierce the horizon)</i>

122
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,652
{\an8}<i>(We pierce!)</i>

123
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,014
{\an8}The times have changed them!

124
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,713
<i>(In midnight blue darkness)</i>

125
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:17,603
<i>(We grovel and squirm to
get our hands on what we want)</i>

126
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,014
{\an8}<i>(We squirm!)</i>

127
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,250
{\an8}I hear those voices,

128
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,486
{\an8}Those oh-so-familiar voices!

129
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:39,063
<i>Well, your faces seem to be asking
“Who’s this?” so listen up!</i>

130
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,000
<i>Let me introduce myself:</i>

131
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,731
<i>Speedwagon’s in da house!</i>

132
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:46,620
<i>While I’m passing down this
story to the future generations,</i>

133
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:50,380
<i>Since it’ll all be yours, I might
as well tell you all what’s sweet</i>

134
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,258
<i>Let me tell you what’s going
on in this era and this land</i>

135
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:58,345
<i>Let</i> Speedwagon <i>tell you
all about this era and this land!</i>

136
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:02,814
<i>(The world is speeding up)</i>

137
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,815
{\an8}<i>(Speeding up)</i>

138
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:06,431
<i>(So don’t let yourself be thrown off!)</i>

139
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:10,493
<i>(The lamplight of the Industrial
Revolution burns bright)</i>

140
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:14,073
<i>(So we sleep with hope in our hearts)</i>

141
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,141
{\an8}Between the light and darkness!

142
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:18,832
<i>(Should strife and inequality judge you)</i>

143
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:25,576
<i>(Reach out your hand to
the sunlight yellow beam)</i>

144
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,102
{\an8}And reach for the heavens!

145
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:30,323
<i>(Set your soul aflame in
the beat of the steam)</i>

146
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,177
{\an8}The light!

147
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:34,577
<i>(The midnight blue darkness is growing)</i>

148
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:39,051
<i>(Throw away your fears,
and cut ties with your weaknesses)</i>

149
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,243
{\an8}The dark!

150
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:43,503
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

151
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:43,550
<i>Light and dark, illumination and shadow
Front and back, two diverging paths</i>

152
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:47,678
<i>Challenge your God, seize your fortune
It’s a new era, steam trains are the craze</i>

153
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,259
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

154
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,697
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

155
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,975
<i>The factory of the world, Great Britain</i>

156
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,934
<i>The spark of desire ignites to no end</i>

157
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,923
<i>The social order got a great reset</i>

158
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:54,949
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

159
00:10:53,924 --> 00:10:55,698
<i>Don’t let this era
slip from your hands</i>

160
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:59,990
<i>(Sunlight yellow gleam,
the hymn of humanity)</i>

161
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,205
{\an8}Sunlight yellow!

162
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,589
<i>(With voices ringing to the heavens)</i>

163
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,774
{\an8}The hymn of humanity!

164
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,329
{\an8}To the heavens!

165
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:06,245
<i>(Midnight blue darkness)</i>

166
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,646
{\an8}Midnight blue!

167
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:12,084
<i>(We rip through the wasteland,
carrying our resolve)</i>

168
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,472
{\an8}Rip through the wasteland!

169
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:16,556
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

170
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:14,714
<i>Newborn babes crying out
in the midst of disparity</i>

171
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,666
<i>A lineage of destiny, Phantom Blood</i>

172
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:18,877
<i>Fate’s thread is woven without any end</i>

173
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,393
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

174
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,995
<i>And just as with any adventure of men,
Always gorgeous but bizarre now and then</i>

175
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:25,231
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

176
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,600
<i>See with your own eyes the whole venture</i>

177
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
<i>That’s right, this is
one Bizarre Adventure!</i>

178
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,401
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

179
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:45,451
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

180
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:47,478
Oi!

181
00:11:47,503 --> 00:11:48,506
Stupid brat!

182
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,854
Stop!

183
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,219
Shit—

184
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,478
Oi, brat! Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?

185
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:56,061
C’mon, let’s go!

186
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,559
Nice!

187
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,301
Hey, look at ‘im. Bastard!

188
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,204
Don’t let this brat go!

189
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,792
Little puke stain!

190
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,338
What’re you looking at, smart-arse?

191
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,143
Oi!

192
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,651
How’s your old man doing, shitstain?

193
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,450
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

194
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,789
He croak or somethin’?

195
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,325
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

196
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,009
Shame, she was a real looker!

197
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:36,784
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

198
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,838
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

199
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,565
What is it, Father?

200
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,850
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

201
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,012
Nah, I don’t need that.

202
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:48,859
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

203
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,003
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

204
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,915
I’m worried that after I die...

205
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:59,744
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

206
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,073
Oi!

207
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,207
Dio!

208
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,698
Take this.

209
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:10,086
“Joestar”?

210
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:12,422
He’s a noble.

211
00:13:12,422 --> 00:13:16,422
And he owes me one.

212
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,813
When I die, send him that letter.

213
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:22,430
Go to him.

214
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,558
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

215
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,915
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

216
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:31,699
Father...

217
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:34,959
<i>Now</i> you start acting like a parent?!

218
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:36,030
Dio!

219
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Listen up...

220
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:40,276
You’re a smart boy.

221
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,002
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

222
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:04,619
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

223
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:10,829
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

224
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:16,705
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

225
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:22,441
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

226
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:28,781
<i>And yet, my mum told me to be noble</i>

227
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:35,120
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

228
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:40,859
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

229
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:47,198
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

230
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,208
Just like that...

231
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:55,774
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

232
00:14:56,554 --> 00:15:01,613
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

233
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,986
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

234
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:13,264
<i>Is it blue?</i>

235
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,895
<i>Tell me, Joestar</i>

236
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:32,845
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

237
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,317
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

238
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:44,578
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

239
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:50,863
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

240
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:56,835
<i>Now, I’ll go take this “inheritance”</i>

241
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:03,364
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

242
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:11,750
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

243
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:17,724
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

244
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:24,062
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

245
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:31,837
<i>Is the sun shining?</i>

246
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:37,518
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

247
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:57,729
Oh yeah!

248
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:00,701
You’ve got something good today too, eh?

249
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,900
Give it back!

250
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:03,694
Over here!

251
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:10,296
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

252
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,072
My father’s a real doctor!

253
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,574
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

254
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:19,407
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!

255
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:21,138
Stop right there!

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,811
What are you doing?! Take this!

257
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:34,694
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

258
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,078
Ow! That hurt!

259
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:38,697
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?

260
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:41,094
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

261
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,942
I’m gonna give him even
more of a walloping!

262
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,127
Ah-ha!

263
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:51,450
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

264
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:58,999
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

265
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:03,127
Danny!

266
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:04,722
Eh?!

267
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:07,832
Let’s go already! Shit!

268
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,987
Uh... Are you alright?

269
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:14,059
Leave me alone!

270
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:14,543
But...

271
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,527
I did this because I wanted to.

272
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,552
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.

273
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,781
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

274
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:27,423
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

275
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,637
I’ll beat them, someday.

276
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,364
Let’s go, Danny!

277
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:37,488
Oh, wait!

278
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,787
Jonathan Joestar...

279
00:19:21,054 --> 00:19:22,054
You...

280
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,237
You must be Dio Brando!

281
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:27,412
And you’re...

282
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:28,935
Jonathan Joestar?

283
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,249
Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!

284
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,535
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

285
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,044
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!

286
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,473
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

287
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:39,497
Friend?

288
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:40,525
Yeah!

289
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,444
Danny! What was that for!

290
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,444
Danny!

291
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:48,508
You won’t get away with this!

292
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:51,182
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

293
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,235
Lord Joestar!

294
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,174
Come inside!

295
00:19:56,901 --> 00:20:01,078
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

296
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:03,883
Something wrong, JoJo?

297
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:05,317
Ah, nothing.

298
00:20:06,022 --> 00:20:09,087
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

299
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:12,621
Starting today, you are part of our family.

300
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,708
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

301
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,375
Yes!

302
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:20,169
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.

303
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:22,546
Mister Brando!

304
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,570
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

305
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,190
Police? Has something happened?

306
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,051
Oh, no!

307
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,143
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

308
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:35,195
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

309
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,181
Ah, that was—

310
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,041
-He came at me so suddenly.

311
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:41,815
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

312
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:45,657
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

313
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:51,530
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

314
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,239
JoJo!

315
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:56,435
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

316
00:20:57,918 --> 00:20:58,599
Yes, sir.

317
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,437
Good.

318
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:05,322
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

319
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,457
Make sure to get along with each other.

320
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,854
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

321
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:12,179
Mister Brando!

322
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:16,655
Nice to have met you!

323
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:21,126
Ta-ta, JoJo!

324
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:30,656
Now then, let me get—

325
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,028
Watch it!

326
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,372
Don’t touch my bag!

327
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,496
I was just trying to carry it for—

328
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,528
That’s enough.

329
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,521
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

330
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,415
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

331
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,071
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

332
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:51,914
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!

333
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:55,008
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

334
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,229
I was only trying to be friendly!

335
00:21:57,423 --> 00:22:00,098
What are you two doing?

336
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,155
And one more thing—

337
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:08,440
I hate dogs.

338
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:12,572
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

339
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:15,413
Keep your stupid dog away from me!

340
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,634
Coming, Lord Joestar!

341
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:32,073
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

342
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,305
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?

343
00:22:55,422 --> 00:23:03,161
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

344
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:11,070
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

345
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:15,902
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

346
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,602
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>

347
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:16,586
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>

348
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:18,950
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

349
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,918
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>

350
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:21,964
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

351
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:26,715
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

352
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,153
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

353
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:31,423
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

354
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,393
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

355
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:38,630
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

356
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:43,932
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

357
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,808
It’s just because I love reading so much!

358
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:49,307
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

359
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:05,393
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

360
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:12,954
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

361
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:18,041
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

362
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,882
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>

363
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:18,636
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

364
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:21,851
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

365
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:21,798
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>

366
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

367
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:28,563
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

368
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,435
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

369
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:32,984
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

370
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,420
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

371
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,396
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

372
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:45,497
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

373
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,991
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>

374
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,951
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

375
00:24:53,419 --> 00:25:02,547
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

376
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
But...

377
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:08,279
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

378
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:18,380
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

379
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:27,605
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

380
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,229
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

381
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,084
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

382
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:43,782
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

383
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:45,335
And so she gave them this condition:

384
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:53,764
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

385
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,431
Here is my question for you:

386
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

387
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:06,044
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

388
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:10,665
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

389
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:14,219
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

390
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:20,158
Or was it the stars shining above them?

391
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,689
What do you think?

392
00:26:23,801 --> 00:26:24,901
The stars?

393
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,044
Or the mud?

394
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:30,174
I...

395
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,880
I think they were looking at the mud.

396
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:38,240
What’s your reasoning?

397
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:44,482
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

398
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:48,446
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

399
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:51,071
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,

400
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,184
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

401
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:54,222
I think...

402
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:57,323
They were looking at the stars!

403
00:26:57,854 --> 00:26:59,665
They held onto their honour!

404
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,187
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

405
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:03,394
So what!

406
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,480
So what?

407
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:12,173
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

408
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:13,474
But they—

409
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:17,715
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

410
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,305
Such regret...

411
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:21,631
Such powerlessness...

412
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,244
What they saw was the mud!

413
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,505
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

414
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,371
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

415
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:33,345
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!

416
00:27:33,345 --> 00:27:34,445
Listen!

417
00:27:35,337 --> 00:27:37,916
You’re a noble! You have it all!

418
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,721
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

419
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:45,289
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

420
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:45,991
I—

421
00:27:45,992 --> 00:27:48,388
That’s enough, you two.

422
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:53,251
There’s no right answer to this question.

423
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:55,132
Bear in mind—

424
00:27:55,846 --> 00:28:00,312
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

425
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:04,495
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

426
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:09,274
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

427
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:14,706
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

428
00:28:42,023 --> 00:28:44,370
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>

429
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,704
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>

430
00:28:46,704 --> 00:28:49,609
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>

431
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:53,171
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>

432
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:55,482
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>

433
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:57,243
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

434
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,244
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

435
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:00,990
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>

436
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,737
<i>The opening bell rings</i>

437
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:05,395
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>

438
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:07,792
Oi!

439
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:10,348
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!

440
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,924
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!

441
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:28,679
Our new champion!

442
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,029
You did it, JoJo!

443
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,671
Danny would be proud!

444
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:36,137
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?

445
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:37,761
Is there anyone?

446
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,714
Everyone listen up!

447
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:44,715
A new face has just asked to join our game.

448
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:47,965
His name is Dio Brando!

449
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:50,000
Dio Brando?

450
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:53,780
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?

451
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:55,294
Yeah! Do it!

452
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,717
Alright, let’s do it!

453
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:57,747
-Good!

454
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:00,325
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—

455
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:02,825
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.

456
00:30:02,826 --> 00:30:05,605
That’s the bell!

457
00:30:04,073 --> 00:30:05,611
-Go, JoJo!

458
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:07,140
Beat him up!

459
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:09,265
What is this move!

460
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:10,704
I’ve never seen it before!

461
00:30:10,728 --> 00:30:11,966
Oi, JoJo!

462
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:30,053
That’s a hit to the face!

463
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:31,053
He lost!

464
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:35,585
Our king! Our king!

465
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,085
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!

466
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,839
My eye!

467
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,586
Guys, guys, guys!

468
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:47,847
I think my finger went in his eye.

469
00:30:48,622 --> 00:30:52,243
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!

470
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:52,457
-Hey, hey!

471
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:56,702
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

472
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,869
Teach me!

473
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,205
Guys! Ow...

474
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:08,613
Danny...

475
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:16,287
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

476
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:20,958
It feels like he’s invading my life.

477
00:31:26,331 --> 00:31:30,101
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>

478
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,811
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>

479
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:44,682
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>

480
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:50,454
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

481
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:56,320
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

482
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:02,867
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

483
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:10,175
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

484
00:32:10,489 --> 00:32:16,545
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

485
00:32:24,012 --> 00:32:25,012
You’re...

486
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:38,358
My hanky...

487
00:32:40,736 --> 00:32:43,220
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!

488
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,832
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

489
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,755
So stop by again!

490
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:48,636
Danny!

491
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,609
Has it caught your fancy?

492
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:08,871
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.

493
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,252
It’s alright.

494
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:16,363
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.

495
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Mexico...

496
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:18,776
Mm-hmm.

497
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:25,316
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.

498
00:33:26,396 --> 00:33:29,620
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

499
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:33,558
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

500
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:38,229
Are you interested in it?

501
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:41,361
Oh, no. Not especially.

502
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,635
Uh...

503
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:49,225
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

504
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,519
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

505
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,082
Friendship? With a dog?

506
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:03,928
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

507
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:09,794
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

508
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:12,597
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

509
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:19,003
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

510
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:25,376
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.

511
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,949
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

512
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:33,083
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

513
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,095
It was Danny!

514
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:39,390
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

515
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:46,970
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

516
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:55,973
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

517
00:34:57,632 --> 00:35:01,535
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

518
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:03,307
Is that so?

519
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:04,077
M’lord.

520
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,550
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

521
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,467
Friends...

522
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:18,877
Erina!

523
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:19,671
JoJo!

524
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:21,687
The two met once more!

525
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:26,835
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

526
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:30,641
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

527
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:33,395
Danny!

528
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,021
Come boy!

529
00:35:38,825 --> 00:35:43,385
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

530
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,612
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

531
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,713
Huh? It’s nothing.

532
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:51,921
What are you hiding?

533
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,507
It’s nothing interesting.

534
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:55,340
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

535
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,523
You’ll just laugh!

536
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:57,960
I won’t laugh.

537
00:35:58,027 --> 00:35:58,924
You’ll tell people!

538
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,138
I won’t tell, so show me!

539
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,258
I told you, no!

540
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,444
JoJo!

541
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh, my!

542
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:13,849
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>

543
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:22,200
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

544
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:26,038
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>

545
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:26,843
Oh!

546
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:29,933
<i>To be laughing like this</i>

547
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:38,008
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

548
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:39,967
<i>Erina</i>

549
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:41,879
<i>JoJo</i>

550
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:45,916
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

551
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:53,424
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

552
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,993
<i>JoJo</i>

553
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:58,128
<i>Erina</i>

554
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,966
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

555
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:08,860
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

556
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:18,315
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

557
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,293
<i>That would be so
embarrassing, you—</i>

558
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,746
<i>Scoundrel!</i>

559
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:33,663
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>

560
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:42,209
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

561
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,241
<i>Your hand,</i>

562
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,277
<i>My hand,</i>

563
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,680
<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>

564
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:57,488
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

565
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:06,260
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

566
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:16,274
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>

567
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:21,512
It’s already this late!

568
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:25,082
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

569
00:38:25,913 --> 00:38:26,913
Erina!

570
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,088
I’ll see you tomorrow!

571
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:29,866
Yes, JoJo!

572
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:30,721
Danny!

573
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:42,197
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>

574
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:50,108
<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>

575
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:58,148
Hey!

576
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:01,982
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

577
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:08,088
I heard you were hanging
out with JoJo today.

578
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:09,844
Umm...

579
00:39:10,122 --> 00:39:11,222
What do you...

580
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,328
He...

581
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,876
He did it!

582
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,511
That’s our Dio!

583
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:47,844
He does the things we’re too chicken
to, and with such confidence too!

584
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:51,695
I’ve got goosebumps!
I want to be just like him!

585
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,441
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

586
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,278
You haven’t, have you?

587
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,974
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...

588
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,585
It was me, Dio!

589
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:14,358
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

590
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,037
Hey!

591
00:40:18,046 --> 00:40:19,664
She’s—!

592
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:21,508
You bitch!

593
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,920
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

594
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:38,382
<i>Dio...</i>

595
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:43,445
<i>Dio...</i>

596
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,609
Get up, bitch!

597
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,339
What’re you sleeping for?

598
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,039
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!

599
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:56,367
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

600
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:58,560
Hey, now go buy some booze!

601
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,425
Father, mother’s clearly not well!

602
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:04,403
She’s just fakin’ it!

603
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,679
Oi, you hear me?

604
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:07,021
-Stop it, Father!

605
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:08,671
Mum! Mum!

606
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:10,893
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

607
00:41:10,894 --> 00:41:13,530
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

608
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:18,889
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!

609
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:22,131
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

610
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:24,623
Please, you’ve got to get well!

611
00:41:27,281 --> 00:41:31,225
<i>Dio...</i>

612
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:35,906
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

613
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:35,539
-Mum! Mum!

614
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:39,293
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

615
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:43,113
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!

616
00:41:43,338 --> 00:41:44,760
But our money’s already—

617
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,017
Are you talking back?!

618
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:49,021
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?

619
00:41:49,021 --> 00:41:52,146
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!

620
00:41:52,154 --> 00:41:54,201
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?

621
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:54,795
Father!

622
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:58,530
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!

623
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,601
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!

624
00:42:03,714 --> 00:42:06,703
After all the trouble I went
through to nick that noble’s shit!

625
00:42:06,977 --> 00:42:09,598
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.

626
00:42:09,598 --> 00:42:11,808
Why don’t I send him a letter...

627
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,290
No...

628
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,130
You and I are different!

629
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:22,917
<i>Dio...</i>

630
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:27,824
<i>Dio...</i>

631
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:30,442
<i>Dio...</i>

632
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,575
Dio!!

633
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:35,332
<i>Dio...</i>

634
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:43,301
<i>Dio, how could you do such a thing?
How could you hurt her like that!</i>

635
00:42:43,412 --> 00:42:49,412
<i>What in the world have I ever done
to you?! Can you tell me, Dio?</i>

636
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:54,033
<i>You’re so amazing, so
much more than I am</i>

637
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,385
I admired you!

638
00:42:56,088 --> 00:43:02,375
<i>But now there is a single
flame that burns in my heart</i>

639
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,633
Dio!

640
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,948
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

641
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:13,990
<i>DIO: A little too lightly?
JOJO: I’ll never forgive you!</i>

642
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:18,147
<i>So you’ve heard? What I
did to your beloved Erina?</i>

643
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,147
-You’ve disgraced her!

644
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:21,678
DIO: I bet you’re mad with jealousy!
<i>JOJO: This is for her sake, not mine!</i>

645
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:33,118
<i>I have to stand up to him, even
if I can’t beat him. I cannot lose!</i>

646
00:43:34,141 --> 00:43:39,863
<i>Control your emotions, you’re
different from that drunken lout</i>

647
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:45,998
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

648
00:43:46,561 --> 00:43:52,542
<i>I’ll put you back in your place,
I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget</i>

649
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:55,838
Come at me!

650
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:59,270
<i>This new power arising within me</i>

651
00:43:59,488 --> 00:44:00,972
It feels so good!

652
00:44:08,705 --> 00:44:12,425
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

653
00:44:13,277 --> 00:44:14,277
Dio!

654
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:23,774
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

655
00:44:27,824 --> 00:44:31,094
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

656
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:33,851
<i>You miserable insect!</i>

657
00:44:34,252 --> 00:44:36,924
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

658
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:43,623
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

659
00:44:43,623 --> 00:44:48,732
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

660
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,185
What on earth is going on?!

661
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:58,804
You two! You’ll be punished for this!
Now go back to your rooms!

662
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
Dio...

663
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:16,328
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

664
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,033
Ah... Eri—

665
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:29,039
I feel so miserable!

666
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:33,533
I’ve never felt pain like this before...

667
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:34,549
Erina!

668
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:40,884
Erina! Did you say goodbye
to all your friends?

669
00:45:43,379 --> 00:45:44,579
Yes, Father.

670
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:49,197
I’m sorry for imposing my career
on you. Even though I know you—

671
00:45:49,197 --> 00:45:50,197
Let’s go.

672
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,068
I’ll make friends over there too.

673
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,655
Erina...

674
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,806
I underestimated JoJo.

675
00:46:04,449 --> 00:46:06,576
His explosive power...

676
00:46:07,802 --> 00:46:09,480
His resilience...

677
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:12,549
I have to become stronger...

678
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:16,086
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

679
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:20,557
I have to control my anger and stay calm...

680
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:25,062
So that I can take everything from him!

681
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:45,011
However...

682
00:46:54,372 --> 00:46:55,435
What’s that noise?

683
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,464
Could someone be
inside the incinerator?

684
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:03,198
Are they trying to get out?!

685
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,670
Ah, it burns!

686
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,288
Danny!!

687
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:11,713
Oh my god...

688
00:47:11,737 --> 00:47:14,006
Someone! Someone please help!

689
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:53,696
<i>Seven years passed from that day</i>

690
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:56,318
<i>Times are changing,
the Victorian era’s flying by us</i>

691
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,541
<i>Population increasing to
the point of overflowing</i>

692
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,796
<i>Art and entertainment
are showered in praise</i>

693
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:03,649
<i>In the middle of this
unstoppable flow, agitation rages</i>

694
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,150
<i>The height of development,
the growth of British culture</i>

695
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:08,339
<i>But what goes up, must come
down. It’s only natural</i>

696
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,231
<i>That the top runners are being singled out</i>

697
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,238
<i>London’s peace has one
of its fingers broken</i>

698
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:14,197
<i>Chaotic days mix the old and the new</i>

699
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,174
<i>The map of London
paints a stark contrast</i>

700
00:48:16,174 --> 00:48:18,341
<i>Just like the current state of the country</i>

701
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:20,063
<i>Put the focus on the
dark parts and you’ll see</i>

702
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,253
<i>The curtain of swaying inequality</i>

703
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:24,259
<i>In this market still
learning from its past!</i>

704
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:28,551
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

705
00:48:28,552 --> 00:48:29,842
The one excavated from Mexico?

706
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:31,429
From Mexico, you say?

707
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:33,168
It was quite a while ago...

708
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:35,897
A while?! Could you please clarify?

709
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:38,738
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

710
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:42,032
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

711
00:48:42,056 --> 00:48:43,916
And bought it from me at a high price—

712
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,724
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

713
00:48:46,732 --> 00:48:48,474
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

714
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:49,478
Wait a minute!

715
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:51,160
I don’t trust you...

716
00:48:51,446 --> 00:48:53,743
Who the hell are you anyway?

717
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:58,848
I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

718
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:01,351
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

719
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:02,497
All the way from Italy?!

720
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:03,165
Yes.

721
00:49:03,188 --> 00:49:05,283
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

722
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:07,402
I’ll go check in the books!

723
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,402
Thank you.

724
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,855
Just a little word of warning...

725
00:49:13,148 --> 00:49:15,198
The sun will be setting soon.

726
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:18,502
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

727
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,175
A fog has rolled in...

728
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:30,287
<i>(A palpable shadow stretches over the city)
</i>

729
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:33,716
<i>(And soon it’ll swallow the sun whole)</i>

730
00:49:33,893 --> 00:49:41,701
<i>(Don’t let it get you,
fight as hard as you can!)</i>

731
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:49,532
<i>(Fog and smog cover the city,
hiding the smell of crime)</i>

732
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:56,296
<i>(Stretch out your hands towards the light)</i>

733
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,448
<i>(We won’t sink down to hell!)</i>

734
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:09,427
<i>The filth rubs off on the clean
and gathers like grime</i>

735
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,436
<i>Thrown away with the rubbish</i>

736
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:17,093
<i>Pressed together, our
lot gives off a stench</i>

737
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:20,784
<i>The sweet smell of darkness</i>

738
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:24,393
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

739
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:32,474
<i>(Something’s wrong, people
 are thirsty, distorted, broken!)</i>

740
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:39,816
<i>(Jack the Ripper has drawn first blood!)</i>

741
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:47,809
<i>(Hate the poor, hate the
rich, and raise your voice)</i>

742
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:54,627
<i>(Gather here and now, Jacks of this town!)</i>

743
00:50:55,105 --> 00:50:56,986
<i>(Rebellion is now!)</i>

744
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,481
<i>In 1887, in Trafalgar Square</i>

745
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:03,974
<i>(We raise our voices!)</i>

746
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:06,739
<i>(Give us equality! Work! And money!)</i>

747
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,796
<i>The rich in their ivory towers</i>

748
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:11,713
<i>(They look on at us and laugh!)</i>

749
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,835
<i>(Give us food! Every day! Let us live!)</i>

750
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:18,638
<i>(The world is ever accelerating)</i>

751
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:22,015
<i>Rebellion is stopped in its tracks,
blood floods the streets of London</i>

752
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:25,611
<i>Away from there now, in Liverpool,
seven years have flown by</i>

753
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:26,874
<i>Their graduation year</i>

754
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:29,285
<i>Their graduation? But who are “they”?</i>

755
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,367
<i>From inside the scrum
they head for victory</i>

756
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:35,109
<i>So dazzling, brightly
shining, a pair of stars</i>

757
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:43,160
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices!)</i>

758
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:44,840
He’s got it!

759
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,720
The star of Hugh Hudson, our very
own Jonathan Joestar, grabs the pass!

760
00:51:51,993 --> 00:51:54,078
<i>(He’s like a heavy locomotive!)</i>

761
00:51:53,406 --> 00:51:54,506
{\an8}<i>(One’s on his back!)</i>

762
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,258
<i>(He can’t be toppled)</i>

763
00:51:55,302 --> 00:51:56,402
{\an8}<i>(And a second!)</i>

764
00:51:56,259 --> 00:51:59,369
<i>(Keep pushing forward, JoJo!)</i>

765
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:59,324
{\an8}<i>(Bloody hell!)</i>

766
00:51:59,376 --> 00:52:01,662
<i>(The pride of our school!)</i>

767
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:01,864
{\an8}<i>(Incredible!)</i>

768
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:03,581
<i>(Hugh Hudson’s acclaimed JoJo!)</i>

769
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:03,744
{\an8}<i>(And a fourth!)</i>

770
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:05,706
<i>(Is he finally wavering?)</i>

771
00:52:05,707 --> 00:52:07,139
{\an8}Someone caught the pass!

772
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:09,156
<i>(None other than the great star Dio)</i>

773
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,758
{\an8}<i>(Dio Brando)</i>

774
00:52:09,187 --> 00:52:10,536
<i>(Leaving them all behind)</i>

775
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:13,177
<i>(Once again, Dio catches the pass)</i>

776
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:14,189
{\an8}<i>(Nobody can catch up to him)</i>

777
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:17,603
<i>(They move like clockwork! You’d
almost feel bad for their rivals!)</i>

778
00:52:17,627 --> 00:52:20,625
<i>(Our school’s pride!)</i>

779
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,286
{\an8}<i>(Truly!)</i>

780
00:52:21,286 --> 00:52:24,754
<i>(JoJo and Dio!)</i>

781
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:29,264
<i>(In perfect harmony, they
make the best partners!)</i>

782
00:52:29,264 --> 00:52:33,063
JoJo! Your pass won’t go to waste!

783
00:52:33,555 --> 00:52:34,817
Try!!

784
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:37,386
The final match of the
season ends in victory!

785
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:38,068
Dio!

786
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:38,665
JoJo!

787
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,003
That was magnificent!

788
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:41,987
It was all thanks to your pass!

789
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:45,503
Let’s go and tell Father
about it right away!

790
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:47,217
Right, JoJo?

791
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:47,876
Uh-huh.

792
00:52:47,922 --> 00:52:49,224
Dio!

793
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:53,072
Can we write about your friendship
with JoJo for the school newspaper?

794
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:54,072
Thanks!

795
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:56,898
Let me get changed first.

796
00:52:56,898 --> 00:52:57,807
Shall we go home together?

797
00:52:57,832 --> 00:52:58,731
Yeah.

798
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:07,597
<i>Time passed like the
endless flow of water</i>

799
00:53:08,183 --> 00:53:14,938
<i>Ever since you started
calling him “Father”</i>

800
00:53:16,228 --> 00:53:21,644
<i>I think of that word
which is so familiar to me</i>

801
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:28,699
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

802
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:35,759
<i>You’re... beautiful,
and a true gentleman</i>

803
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:42,165
<i>My friend, who’s always
pushing me to be better</i>

804
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:49,539
<i>You’ve repented for the
wrong you did to Erina</i>

805
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:58,944
<i>You’ve offered me a shoulder
to lean on, now that Danny’s gone</i>

806
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:05,476
<i>We walked this path
together for seven years</i>

807
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:09,674
<i>I always followed in your
footsteps, one step behind,</i>

808
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:21,606
<i>So why is it that I don’t
feel any friendship for you?</i>

809
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,523
How are you feeling?

810
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:47,239
Well, I’m old enough now that
a mere cold can last a long time.

811
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:49,303
Sir, you’re not that old yet!

812
00:54:51,105 --> 00:54:54,907
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!

813
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,564
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...

814
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,763
Seem to have won!

815
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:08,237
Ah, Dio is a proper member
of the Joestar family now!

816
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,322
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.

817
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:16,893
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

818
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:21,800
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

819
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:23,494
I...

820
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,902
I admire you! Back then—

821
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:26,947
My lord!

822
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:27,602
Yes?

823
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:28,921
I’m home!

824
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:32,985
Dio! Welcome back!
Ah, and JoJo as well!

825
00:55:34,403 --> 00:55:35,403
Father!

826
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:36,846
Are you alright?

827
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,595
I can’t get rid of this cough...

828
00:55:41,181 --> 00:55:44,928
Today, the doctor recommended
I be admitted to hospital.

829
00:55:47,158 --> 00:55:48,458
I object!

830
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:54,284
These days, hospitals
only care about profits!

831
00:55:54,697 --> 00:55:56,569
They say it’s a problem in London too.

832
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:58,592
It’s true...

833
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:01,237
I feel safer at home.

834
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:03,261
I give in.

835
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:09,010
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.

836
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:13,324
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!

837
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:13,710
What?!

838
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:14,205
What?!

839
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:15,259
You already know?

840
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:16,316
How?

841
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,222
Inspector Archer here told me.

842
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:20,801
How rude of you, inspector!

843
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:21,306
Huh?

844
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,293
We...

845
00:56:24,235 --> 00:56:26,963
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...

846
00:56:27,545 --> 00:56:28,704
So we rushed home!

847
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,335
Oh no, silly me!

848
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,407
I truly am proud.

849
00:56:38,302 --> 00:56:41,794
I have such wonderful sons.

850
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:45,565
Especially you, Dio.

851
00:56:46,089 --> 00:56:48,251
You’ve worked so very hard.

852
00:56:49,146 --> 00:56:53,002
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.

853
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,987
I was born poor...

854
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,440
But you gave me a chance.

855
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,233
Thank you.

856
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:04,510
Well then, I’ll be off.

857
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:07,838
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

858
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:12,429
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.

859
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,877
But this is Liverpool!

860
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:19,882
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

861
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:22,018
Now, if you’ll pardon me.

862
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,146
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

863
00:57:51,086 --> 00:57:52,386
Who on earth made this...

864
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:54,299
And for what reason?

865
00:57:56,252 --> 00:58:00,125
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

866
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:03,822
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

867
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,599
This is...

868
00:58:16,972 --> 00:58:18,207
Dario Brando?

869
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:21,139
Thank you again, Master Dio—

870
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,910
Oh, it’s the least I could do.

871
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:27,817
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

872
00:58:28,684 --> 00:58:30,476
“Right now... I’m sick.”

873
00:58:31,515 --> 00:58:33,047
“I’ll probably die.”

874
00:58:33,984 --> 00:58:35,391
“My heart hurts,”

875
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:37,109
“My hands shake,”

876
00:58:38,503 --> 00:58:40,229
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

877
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:48,638
<i>Dio...</i>

878
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:52,942
<i>Dio...</i>

879
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:57,714
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

880
00:58:57,715 --> 00:59:02,320
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

881
00:59:02,653 --> 00:59:06,947
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

882
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,088
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

883
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:15,721
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

884
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:19,784
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

885
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:24,983
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

886
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:26,209
I know!

887
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:30,483
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!

888
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,364
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>

889
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:39,777
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>

890
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:41,460
I don’t bloody need it anymore!

891
00:59:41,467 --> 00:59:45,451
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

892
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:48,332
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>

893
00:59:48,363 --> 00:59:49,915
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

894
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:57,773
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

895
00:59:59,198 --> 01:00:02,582
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

896
01:00:03,203 --> 01:00:06,018
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>

897
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:16,276
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

898
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:20,830
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

899
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:25,034
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

900
01:00:25,034 --> 01:00:28,237
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

901
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:32,285
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

902
01:00:33,524 --> 01:00:36,646
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

903
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,317
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

904
01:00:50,992 --> 01:00:51,992
Dio!

905
01:00:53,261 --> 01:00:54,830
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

906
01:00:57,466 --> 01:00:58,688
What’s the matter, JoJo?

907
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:01,019
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

908
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:06,402
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.

909
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:08,479
Huh?

910
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,152
Show me that.

911
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:12,715
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

912
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,120
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

913
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:20,190
What is this non—

914
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,191
Answer me!

915
01:01:22,213 --> 01:01:24,126
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

916
01:01:24,126 --> 01:01:26,062
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

917
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:29,775
JoJo...

918
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,603
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,

919
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:36,239
Then you doubt our very friendship.

920
01:01:37,122 --> 01:01:38,122
Dio,

921
01:01:38,852 --> 01:01:40,304
As a gentleman,

922
01:01:40,312 --> 01:01:43,549
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.

923
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:46,746
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

924
01:01:47,072 --> 01:01:48,770
I’ll never speak of this again.

925
01:01:48,985 --> 01:01:50,987
Swear on that guy?

926
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:52,835
Dio,

927
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:53,795
Swear on it.

928
01:01:53,795 --> 01:01:55,539
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!

929
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,088
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!

930
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:58,478
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!

931
01:01:58,479 --> 01:02:01,219
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!

932
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,432
Give me the medicine back!

933
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:13,390
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

934
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:15,295
I’m convinced now...

935
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:18,438
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!

936
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:21,716
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

937
01:02:21,732 --> 01:02:23,348
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

938
01:02:24,412 --> 01:02:25,706
Just a misunderstanding...

939
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:27,949
Besides...

940
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:31,116
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?

941
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:33,942
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

942
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,339
Yes,

943
01:02:36,624 --> 01:02:39,101
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

944
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:42,282
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

945
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:44,240
JoJo! JoJo!!

946
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:46,890
JoJo...

947
01:02:48,405 --> 01:02:50,241
Is something the matter, Master Dio?

948
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:52,207
No...

949
01:02:52,988 --> 01:02:54,289
I’m alright...

950
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:03,194
<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

951
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:05,795
It’s too late to turn back now.

952
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:10,132
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

953
01:03:10,605 --> 01:03:14,770
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

954
01:03:18,748 --> 01:03:20,216
Father!

955
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:22,470
What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!

956
01:03:21,444 --> 01:03:22,444
-Father!

957
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,930
What’s all this ruckus for?

958
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:24,948
Father...

959
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:27,305
I’m going to London
for two or three days.

960
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:32,154
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.

961
01:03:32,796 --> 01:03:36,342
Please don’t accept any care
or medicine from anyone else.

962
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,519
Excuse me, but—

963
01:03:37,543 --> 01:03:40,137
We’ll do as he says.

964
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,606
I don’t know what’s going on...

965
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,235
But I trust my son!

966
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:48,671
Thank you, Father.

967
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,147
Seven years ago, this thing...

968
01:03:59,372 --> 01:04:02,184
It moved in reaction to my blood.

969
01:04:16,344 --> 01:04:17,755
With this...

970
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:23,706
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

971
01:04:27,552 --> 01:04:28,552
JoJo...

972
01:04:30,462 --> 01:04:32,515
Your own research...

973
01:04:33,105 --> 01:04:35,591
Will be the death of you!

974
01:05:00,103 --> 01:05:04,260
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>

975
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:07,526
<i>Turning my eyes to the stars
and praying for an antidote</i>

976
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:11,684
<i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>

977
01:05:11,709 --> 01:05:16,203
<i>Now I’ve arrived here
in this town steeped in mud</i>

978
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:19,643
<i>Ogre Street, the place
where plagues are born</i>

979
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:23,403
<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>

980
01:05:23,427 --> 01:05:27,383
<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>

981
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:30,903
<i>Even if I were to lose
this right hand of mine</i>

982
01:05:30,957 --> 01:05:32,026
<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>

983
01:05:32,027 --> 01:05:34,112
<i>At long last our meeting takes place</i>

984
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:35,925
<i>There’s a scent in the air
and it smells like prey</i>

985
01:05:35,926 --> 01:05:38,211
<i>Sniffing you out through the
storm someone’s making his way</i>

986
01:05:38,212 --> 01:05:39,925
<i>It’s time for your
leader to take the stage</i>

987
01:05:39,926 --> 01:05:46,883
<i>(Ogre Street, we devour anything we can)</i>

988
01:05:47,938 --> 01:05:56,147
<i>(Ogre Street, here everything meets its end)</i>

989
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,839
<i>Dunno what the hell
you came here for</i>

990
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,921
<i>Bet you thought you
stood a good chance, huh?</i>

991
01:06:01,945 --> 01:06:03,931
<i>In a moment we’ll
devour all that hope</i>

992
01:06:03,931 --> 01:06:05,885
<i>This is Ogre Street and
we’re the ogres, duh!</i>

993
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:10,013
<i>Got no problem with you bein’ naïve,
I’m just showin’ you the simple reality</i>

994
01:06:10,038 --> 01:06:11,903
<i>Hey hey hey,
how about it, rich boy?</i>

995
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:13,883
<i>Want a taste of the
edge of this knife?</i>

996
01:06:13,915 --> 01:06:17,583
<i>We’re gonna strip you of all that you got
Put up a fight and your life will be lost</i>

997
01:06:17,612 --> 01:06:21,443
<i>This is Ogre Street!
Ain’t it obvious that we’d cheat?</i>

998
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,375
<i>Us have-nots are gonna
steal your riches away!</i>

999
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,828
<i>From your life to that foolish
heart—we’ll steal ‘em away!</i>

1000
01:06:25,913 --> 01:06:29,263
<i>Tail between your legs, you can
save your own skin by runnin’ away!</i>

1001
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:30,088
{\an8}Is this guy insane?!

1002
01:06:29,939 --> 01:06:36,399
<i>(Ogre Street, go on and leave it all behind)</i>

1003
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,724
{\an8}<i>I don’t care if I lose four fingers!</i>

1004
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:43,756
<i>(Ogre Street, we’ll even fill
our stomachs with your life)</i>

1005
01:06:43,763 --> 01:06:47,683
<i>I came here for a reason!</i>

1006
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:55,864
<i>You said you’re fine with
losing four fingers, hah?</i>

1007
01:06:55,889 --> 01:07:03,479
<i>(Ogre Street, why don’t we
put that resolve to the test?)</i>

1008
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:07,863
Hold on! I only came here
looking for a poison seller!

1009
01:07:07,888 --> 01:07:11,763
Quit bluffin’! Let me have a
go at this soft little rich boy!

1010
01:07:28,864 --> 01:07:31,160
That’s the sound of blade hitting bone!

1011
01:07:32,074 --> 01:07:35,453
<i>Made the mistake of my life, pickin’
a fight with this fearless tough guy</i>

1012
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:37,651
<i>Countdown to my final breath—</i>

1013
01:07:37,674 --> 01:07:39,674
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1014
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:52,903
Stop, everyone!

1015
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:58,645
I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!

1016
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:00,829
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?

1017
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:03,023
I came here for the sake of my father.

1018
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,060
So in the moment I kicked,

1019
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:07,696
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.

1020
01:08:08,935 --> 01:08:11,271
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.

1021
01:08:14,252 --> 01:08:16,162
Tell me your name!

1022
01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:19,358
Jonathan Joestar.

1023
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:23,154
Mr. Joestar, if you’re looking
for poison, that’d be Wang Chan.

1024
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,649
Be careful, he’s a crafty one!

1025
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:27,615
Someone bandage his wound.

1026
01:08:27,678 --> 01:08:29,916
I, Speedwagon, will lead you to his shop!

1027
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:30,698
Why?!

1028
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:33,578
‘Cause I’ve taken a liking to ya!

1029
01:08:35,837 --> 01:08:39,593
<i>(Ogre Street)</i>

1030
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:43,761
<i>With your determination to fight</i>

1031
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:51,864
<i>(Ogre Street, you’ve lit in
us a glowing guiding light)</i>

1032
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:55,904
<i>(You, who have the courage)</i>

1033
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,904
<i>(To see the stars down here in the mud)</i>

1034
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:07,907
<i>(Light up the darkness with
your unwavering heart!)</i>

1035
01:09:08,629 --> 01:09:10,059
<i>Your refreshing sunlight</i>

1036
01:09:10,415 --> 01:09:12,083
<i>Brought me completely to my knees</i>

1037
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,692
<i>This must be some
strange twist of fate!</i>

1038
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,144
<i>Let’s toast—to our meeting!</i>

1039
01:09:36,513 --> 01:09:37,513
JoJo...

1040
01:09:42,606 --> 01:09:43,606
JoJo...!

1041
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:58,414
<i>Dio...</i>

1042
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,360
JoJo has gone off to London...

1043
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:03,547
Could he have died a dog’s death already?

1044
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:07,592
<i>Dio...</i>

1045
01:10:08,102 --> 01:10:10,452
Or could he have found
evidence of the medicine?

1046
01:10:10,766 --> 01:10:11,766
Which is it?!

1047
01:10:12,544 --> 01:10:16,225
<i>Dio...</i>

1048
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:19,987
Booze! I can’t help but drink!

1049
01:10:21,225 --> 01:10:25,567
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1050
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:28,403
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

1051
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:30,135
-Shut up, get out of my head!

1052
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:34,584
<i>You’re the only one I care about</i>

1053
01:10:34,607 --> 01:10:38,807
<i>Become the richest man!</i>

1054
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,212
-You piece of shit, we’re not the same!

1055
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:42,165
Watch where you’re going, twat!

1056
01:10:43,057 --> 01:10:46,003
Oi, are you listening, you stupid brat?

1057
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:49,191
You should ask yer mum to hold
you by the hand next time!

1058
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:51,768
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1059
01:10:49,405 --> 01:10:51,551
Didn’t you hear me?

1060
01:10:51,773 --> 01:10:54,465
Oi! You piece of shit—

1061
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:55,575
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1062
01:10:56,535 --> 01:11:00,773
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1063
01:10:56,535 --> 01:11:01,188
You filthy old tramps with
no sense of personal hygiene...

1064
01:11:00,774 --> 01:11:05,012
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1065
01:11:02,247 --> 01:11:04,172
How dare you! You bastard!

1066
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,308
What did you do to my mate?!

1067
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:10,690
{\an8}<i>One man’s misfortune...</i>

1068
01:11:08,088 --> 01:11:09,511
I’ll kill you!

1069
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:13,440
{\an8}<i>Is another man’s fortune!</i>

1070
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:15,445
Interesting, this is a good
opportunity to try it out!

1071
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:16,907
{\an8}<i>You’re my clever boy!</i>

1072
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:17,089
What’re you mumbling about?!

1073
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:21,189
It’s a live human experiment!

1074
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:27,563
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1075
01:11:26,178 --> 01:11:27,808
JoJo!

1076
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:31,767
I’ll find the answer to your
research myself right now!

1077
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:35,582
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1078
01:11:37,615 --> 01:11:38,615
What...

1079
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:41,375
What—

1080
01:11:41,812 --> 01:11:47,026
{\an8}<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

1081
01:11:42,948 --> 01:11:45,147
What is this light?

1082
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,796
Was I hallucinating?

1083
01:11:51,855 --> 01:11:53,155
He’s dead...

1084
01:11:53,488 --> 01:11:56,609
The spikes pierced so deep into his skull,
it must have killed him instantly.

1085
01:11:56,668 --> 01:12:00,024
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.

1086
01:12:00,672 --> 01:12:02,130
He’s not dead!

1087
01:12:04,497 --> 01:12:06,969
Fangs?! What is he?!

1088
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:32,615
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>

1089
01:12:32,677 --> 01:12:34,863
He’s sucking my blood!

1090
01:12:37,141 --> 01:12:38,304
His face is...

1091
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:39,924
Becoming younger?!

1092
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:47,683
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!

1093
01:13:03,626 --> 01:13:05,227
I was saved...

1094
01:13:12,824 --> 01:13:14,346
By the sunlight...

1095
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:18,340
He turned into ash...

1096
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:24,475
Ow!

1097
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,441
So this...

1098
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:36,261
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1099
01:13:41,423 --> 01:13:42,984
So, where is Dio?

1100
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:44,667
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1101
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,016
I’ll call for reinforcements right away.

1102
01:13:46,016 --> 01:13:47,093
Please use the foyer.

1103
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:48,021
Thank you.

1104
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:49,217
-You there!
-Sir!

1105
01:13:49,234 --> 01:13:51,626
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1106
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:52,473
Yes sir!

1107
01:13:55,924 --> 01:13:57,799
Oi, come on!

1108
01:13:58,993 --> 01:13:59,993
JoJo...

1109
01:14:00,532 --> 01:14:01,786
I apologise.

1110
01:14:02,095 --> 01:14:03,912
This is my cross to bear.

1111
01:14:04,633 --> 01:14:05,538
What?

1112
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:08,983
If only I had made sure
that man was exiled...

1113
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,577
Dio’s father...

1114
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,601
Dario Brando.

1115
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:15,003
What do you mean?

1116
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,734
I’ll tell you about it.

1117
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:22,871
This happened when you were a baby.

1118
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,009
This is certainly my ring,

1119
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:31,063
But I never reported a theft.

1120
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:34,349
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.

1121
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:41,143
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1122
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,020
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1123
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:48,397
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1124
01:14:49,978 --> 01:14:53,602
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,

1125
01:14:54,153 --> 01:14:56,037
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1126
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:57,618
I...

1127
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,664
I arrested the criminal!

1128
01:14:59,688 --> 01:15:01,112
Would you like to see for yourself?

1129
01:15:01,136 --> 01:15:03,454
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1130
01:15:03,454 --> 01:15:05,703
He’s certain to be exiled!

1131
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,464
I see.

1132
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,921
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1133
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:15,053
Brando?!

1134
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:16,324
Oh, bollocks.

1135
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:16,926
Then that means—

1136
01:15:16,951 --> 01:15:19,995
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,

1137
01:15:20,028 --> 01:15:21,393
But a thief!

1138
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:27,035
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1139
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:29,946
Why?

1140
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
I...

1141
01:15:31,749 --> 01:15:34,310
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1142
01:15:38,412 --> 01:15:42,584
Did he tell you...

1143
01:15:43,486 --> 01:15:46,743
That I gave him this ring?

1144
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:48,787
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1145
01:15:48,787 --> 01:15:49,926
It’s not a lie.

1146
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:53,795
This is what I gave him.

1147
01:15:54,368 --> 01:15:55,920
He is innocent.

1148
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,923
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1149
01:15:57,929 --> 01:15:58,929
Mr. Brando,

1150
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,232
This is yours.

1151
01:16:01,771 --> 01:16:06,578
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.

1152
01:16:06,578 --> 01:16:09,240
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1153
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:26,662
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1154
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:38,540
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>

1155
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:50,944
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>

1156
01:16:52,187 --> 01:17:04,699
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>

1157
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:06,701
Thank you, sir!

1158
01:17:07,383 --> 01:17:10,872
You are too good-natured!

1159
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:14,733
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!

1160
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:18,113
That may be true,

1161
01:17:18,692 --> 01:17:21,541
But think about it the other way around.

1162
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:32,343
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>

1163
01:17:33,978 --> 01:17:42,337
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>

1164
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:46,808
<i>That pain</i>

1165
01:17:47,838 --> 01:17:53,593
<i>Everything is connected</i>

1166
01:17:53,593 --> 01:17:59,704
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1167
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:09,703
<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>

1168
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:12,132
I can’t see stars or nothin’!
That’s bollocks!

1169
01:18:12,211 --> 01:18:13,449
That’s why...

1170
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:20,541
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1171
01:18:20,758 --> 01:18:26,615
<i>That this gold I’ve passed on</i>

1172
01:18:26,955 --> 01:18:32,522
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1173
01:18:32,622 --> 01:18:37,094
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>

1174
01:18:39,456 --> 01:18:53,308
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1175
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:58,357
Inspector.

1176
01:18:59,949 --> 01:19:01,393
I’ll wait for Dio.

1177
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:05,053
He can still be stopped.

1178
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:30,957
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1179
01:19:31,632 --> 01:19:35,650
It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.

1180
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:38,249
And then...

1181
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:42,724
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.

1182
01:19:45,255 --> 01:19:51,233
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...

1183
01:19:52,300 --> 01:20:00,678
<i>It’s a wedge driven into
the wasteland of my memory</i>

1184
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:10,652
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

1185
01:20:11,486 --> 01:20:20,462
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>

1186
01:20:20,569 --> 01:20:29,471
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>

1187
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:38,180
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>

1188
01:20:39,186 --> 01:20:47,889
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>

1189
01:20:48,259 --> 01:20:53,012
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1190
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:57,132
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1191
01:20:57,133 --> 01:21:00,537
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>

1192
01:21:04,343 --> 01:21:07,089
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”

1193
01:21:07,089 --> 01:21:10,478
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1194
01:21:13,053 --> 01:21:14,449
The Stone Mask...

1195
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:18,920
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1196
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:33,889
I, Dio, was...

1197
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:38,921
Shit...

1198
01:21:42,873 --> 01:21:43,873
JoJo...

1199
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,865
I see you’ve returned from London—

1200
01:21:49,865 --> 01:21:51,486
I have the antidote now.

1201
01:21:57,794 --> 01:21:59,530
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1202
01:22:00,461 --> 01:22:01,776
It truly hurts me.

1203
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,551
Although you might not believe me,

1204
01:22:07,979 --> 01:22:09,480
Those are my true feelings.

1205
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:16,972
I understand, JoJo.

1206
01:22:19,224 --> 01:22:21,170
You’re honest like that.

1207
01:22:25,153 --> 01:22:27,011
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1208
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:30,423
The final one
I will ask of you.

1209
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,494
Can you give me more time?

1210
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:35,861
Time—

1211
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,319
To turn myself in to the police.

1212
01:22:40,749 --> 01:22:41,749
Eh?

1213
01:22:43,644 --> 01:22:44,644
I...

1214
01:22:46,811 --> 01:22:50,090
R-Regret the choices I’ve
made throughout my life.

1215
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:56,054
Because I was born into squalor...

1216
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:01,607
My ambition was relentless.

1217
01:23:05,593 --> 01:23:07,362
What I did was terrible!

1218
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:12,440
I want to repent for my sins!

1219
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:15,936
Don’t believe a word he says!

1220
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,923
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1221
01:23:27,948 --> 01:23:29,931
Allow me to introduce myself!

1222
01:23:30,453 --> 01:23:32,954
I’m Speedwagon, the meddler!

1223
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:36,657
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1224
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,168
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.

1225
01:23:39,665 --> 01:23:42,431
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.

1226
01:23:46,504 --> 01:23:48,131
This guy reeks!

1227
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:51,072
Worse than vomit!

1228
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:53,138
He was born evil!

1229
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:55,849
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1230
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:00,364
This man has confessed already.

1231
01:24:02,967 --> 01:24:03,792
Father...

1232
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:06,287
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1233
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:13,661
I will return to my bed to rest.

1234
01:24:16,142 --> 01:24:21,903
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1235
01:24:23,135 --> 01:24:25,892
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1236
01:24:26,598 --> 01:24:29,271
He was born with an innate destiny.

1237
01:24:29,295 --> 01:24:30,295
Silence!

1238
01:24:30,597 --> 01:24:31,597
Come on—

1239
01:24:34,325 --> 01:24:35,883
JoJo, I understand!

1240
01:24:37,301 --> 01:24:38,699
Arrest me.

1241
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,157
But, if it’s not too much to ask;

1242
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,199
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1243
01:24:44,076 --> 01:24:46,168
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1244
01:24:46,394 --> 01:24:47,394
Be careful!

1245
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,830
Agreed.

1246
01:24:50,811 --> 01:24:52,300
I will handcuff you.

1247
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:04,834
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1248
01:25:04,856 --> 01:25:10,422
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1249
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,546
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1250
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:20,664
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1251
01:25:20,664 --> 01:25:21,664
What’re you talking about?

1252
01:25:21,688 --> 01:25:22,688
<i>You know, JoJo...</i>

1253
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:26,501
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1254
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:34,021
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1255
01:25:35,513 --> 01:25:44,419
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1256
01:25:45,779 --> 01:25:50,591
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1257
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:54,908
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>

1258
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:58,361
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1259
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,702
<i>That murky sky up there,</i>

1260
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:05,840
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1261
01:26:06,103 --> 01:26:10,591
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1262
01:26:10,888 --> 01:26:15,066
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1263
01:26:15,288 --> 01:26:17,362
<i>That’s why, now is the time</i>

1264
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:19,616
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1265
01:26:19,616 --> 01:26:21,889
<i>And seize...</i>

1266
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:25,312
<i>The stars!</i>

1267
01:26:27,647 --> 01:26:28,647
The Stone Mask?

1268
01:26:31,442 --> 01:26:33,010
<i>I...</i>

1269
01:26:36,623 --> 01:26:37,623
<i>I...</i>

1270
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:43,018
<i>Reject...</i>

1271
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:48,364
<i>My humanity!</i>

1272
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:53,205
<i>JoJo!</i>

1273
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:54,493
Stop!

1274
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,226
-JoJo!
-Father!

1275
01:26:58,413 --> 01:26:59,413
Dio!

1276
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:00,919
Dio!

1277
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:08,636
Shoot him!

1278
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:11,591
Shoot him!

1279
01:27:13,784 --> 01:27:14,878
Lord Joestar!

1280
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:17,144
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

1281
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:18,753
Father! Father!

1282
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:22,525
JoJo...

1283
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:26,713
This is...

1284
01:27:30,957 --> 01:27:33,671
Your late mother’s ring.

1285
01:27:33,671 --> 01:27:35,897
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1286
01:27:39,417 --> 01:27:43,625
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

1287
01:27:46,802 --> 01:27:50,676
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...

1288
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:56,684
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.

1289
01:27:57,832 --> 01:27:58,832
Father...

1290
01:28:06,142 --> 01:28:08,241
It’s not so bad...

1291
01:28:10,473 --> 01:28:11,473
JoJo...

1292
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,105
To die...

1293
01:28:21,442 --> 01:28:26,281
In my son’s arms.

1294
01:28:41,197 --> 01:28:42,197
Father?

1295
01:28:44,974 --> 01:28:46,623
How could this be...

1296
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:51,472
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1297
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:54,734
Now he’s dead and there’s
no bringing him back.

1298
01:28:55,724 --> 01:28:56,968
Mr. Joestar...

1299
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:04,284
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1300
01:29:05,864 --> 01:29:10,517
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1301
01:29:13,248 --> 01:29:18,900
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1302
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:26,207
<i>Even though you said you believed me!</i>

1303
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:33,614
<i>I couldn’t protect you—
How could I be so powerless?</i>

1304
01:29:35,483 --> 01:29:38,251
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>

1305
01:29:38,252 --> 01:29:42,449
<i>Father, open your eyes!</i>

1306
01:29:42,523 --> 01:29:45,527
<i>What’s pride worth now?</i>

1307
01:29:45,551 --> 01:29:48,122
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>

1308
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:56,830
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body?</i>

1309
01:29:57,745 --> 01:30:03,344
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1310
01:30:04,952 --> 01:30:11,611
<i>Carrying yourself with
discipline and pride</i>

1311
01:30:12,316 --> 01:30:19,560
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1312
01:30:19,909 --> 01:30:25,232
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>

1313
01:30:27,278 --> 01:30:32,773
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1314
01:30:34,482 --> 01:30:41,782
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1315
01:30:42,052 --> 01:30:47,167
<i>It will become the future,
sent up to the stars</i>

1316
01:30:48,507 --> 01:30:56,064
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1317
01:30:56,166 --> 01:31:01,535
<i>Everything is connected,
there’s a meaning to it all</i>

1318
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:08,856
<i>I’ll fight against this fate,
keep sorrow at bay</i>

1319
01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:15,549
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1320
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:28,130
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1321
01:31:28,154 --> 01:31:29,017
What’s wrong?

1322
01:31:29,018 --> 01:31:32,144
The body... Dio’s body is gone!

1323
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:33,245
What?!

1324
01:31:33,539 --> 01:31:34,638
What did you say?!

1325
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:38,688
Oi copper, get away from the window!

1326
01:31:39,974 --> 01:31:41,767
Inspector!

1327
01:31:49,661 --> 01:31:52,185
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1328
01:31:52,186 --> 01:31:54,241
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1329
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,845
Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!

1330
01:31:57,782 --> 01:31:58,782
Dio!

1331
01:31:59,105 --> 01:32:00,105
Stop!

1332
01:32:02,313 --> 01:32:05,310
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!

1333
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:16,944
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads
or tails of what’s happening!

1334
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:19,976
JoJo!

1335
01:32:20,889 --> 01:32:25,419
Can you hear my voice?

1336
01:32:26,056 --> 01:32:27,586
H-He’s sucking his blood!

1337
01:32:40,023 --> 01:32:41,189
You’re—

1338
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:43,971
JoJo...

1339
01:32:43,971 --> 01:32:50,878
I’ve gained such incredible power!

1340
01:32:52,049 --> 01:32:54,381
From the Stone Mask...

1341
01:32:56,024 --> 01:33:00,423
From your father’s blood!

1342
01:33:00,504 --> 01:33:01,504
Dio!

1343
01:33:01,563 --> 01:33:04,007
These monsters are
making <i>more</i> monsters?!

1344
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:06,418
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1345
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:08,450
That monster is too bloody strong!

1346
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:14,835
The brain!

1347
01:33:15,226 --> 01:33:18,706
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!

1348
01:33:19,438 --> 01:33:20,594
If that’s the case...

1349
01:33:22,025 --> 01:33:24,612
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!

1350
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:34,927
Stop!

1351
01:33:34,951 --> 01:33:35,951
Speedwagon!

1352
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,433
I must...

1353
01:33:46,994 --> 01:33:49,540
I must make my will stronger!

1354
01:34:04,492 --> 01:34:06,387
JoJo!

1355
01:34:09,553 --> 01:34:13,127
Weak! So weak!

1356
01:34:17,101 --> 01:34:18,315
Mr. Joestar!

1357
01:34:18,315 --> 01:34:19,370
Let me...

1358
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:24,505
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1359
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:30,355
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1360
01:34:38,316 --> 01:34:41,321
JoJo...

1361
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:46,472
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1362
01:34:47,965 --> 01:34:49,521
I told you, didn’t I?

1363
01:34:50,449 --> 01:34:53,069
No matter how many
tricks you come up with,

1364
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:57,355
Humans have limits!

1365
01:34:59,765 --> 01:35:04,879
Quit hiding behind that
curtain! Come out here!

1366
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:11,218
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1367
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:16,544
Dio!

1368
01:35:16,584 --> 01:35:18,529
This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!

1369
01:35:19,153 --> 01:35:20,200
It’s courage!

1370
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,198
This fire won’t kill him.

1371
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:27,435
Speedwagon, escape from the mansion.

1372
01:35:27,463 --> 01:35:28,463
What?

1373
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,064
Mr. Joestar!

1374
01:35:31,074 --> 01:35:33,296
Don’t run upstairs!

1375
01:35:44,176 --> 01:35:49,499
<i>(The flash of flames,
illuminating the dark)</i>

1376
01:35:50,224 --> 01:35:52,793
<i>Come, Dio.</i>

1377
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,230
<i>I’m up here.</i>

1378
01:35:56,586 --> 01:35:59,181
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1379
01:35:59,181 --> 01:36:02,770
<i>Very well, I’ll take care of you first</i>

1380
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:08,075
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1381
01:36:08,989 --> 01:36:14,441
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>

1382
01:36:14,465 --> 01:36:16,626
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1383
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:21,387
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1384
01:36:21,412 --> 01:36:24,158
<i>(The flames are pulsing)</i>

1385
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:30,684
<i>JOJO: Father! I’ll mourn you
DIO: I offer you my thanks</i>

1386
01:36:26,576 --> 01:36:30,398
{\an8}<i>(Flickering from light to dark)</i>

1387
01:36:30,684 --> 01:36:35,410
<i>JOJO: Please give me strength
DIO: For giving me strength</i>

1388
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:39,796
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1389
01:36:39,797 --> 01:36:43,870
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1390
01:36:43,871 --> 01:36:47,583
<i>My youth was with you</i>

1391
01:36:48,014 --> 01:36:52,335
<i>It’s time for us to say goodbye to it</i>

1392
01:36:52,359 --> 01:36:53,359
JoJo!

1393
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:56,840
<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

1394
01:36:56,864 --> 01:36:58,864
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1395
01:36:59,697 --> 01:37:05,332
<i>I’ve lost everything, save for my life</i>

1396
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:11,888
<i>I’ll let that burn to ash too.
I’ll stop you, Dio!</i>

1397
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:25,253
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

1398
01:37:25,254 --> 01:37:30,911
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

1399
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:35,049
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

1400
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,940
The fire had already engulfed the
mansion, even overtaking the roof.

1401
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:42,424
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

1402
01:38:14,508 --> 01:38:17,137
This body is immortal.

1403
01:38:17,902 --> 01:38:21,513
The only one dying will be you!

1404
01:38:22,662 --> 01:38:27,003
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1405
01:38:27,003 --> 01:38:30,743
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1406
01:38:30,964 --> 01:38:34,886
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1407
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:39,244
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1408
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,160
-JoJo!

1409
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:43,396
<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

1410
01:38:43,397 --> 01:38:45,776
The knife you stabbed Father with!

1411
01:38:45,777 --> 01:38:47,793
It’s useless! I’m immortal!

1412
01:38:47,794 --> 01:38:55,705
<i>With this final bit of strength</i>

1413
01:38:48,728 --> 01:38:51,887
{\an8}<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1414
01:38:51,903 --> 01:38:55,609
{\an8}<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1415
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:59,948
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1416
01:38:59,948 --> 01:39:04,506
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1417
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:09,576
<i>This can’t be how my life ends—</i>

1418
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:14,464
JoJo!!

1419
01:40:14,358 --> 01:40:15,705
Can you hear me?

1420
01:40:18,485 --> 01:40:19,785
You can hear me.

1421
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,040
Good.

1422
01:40:24,244 --> 01:40:26,600
I hope you had a nice intermission.

1423
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:35,692
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,

1424
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,780
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

1425
01:40:41,591 --> 01:40:45,136
And so that we can continue our
<i>show</i> of love for these characters.

1426
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:48,689
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

1427
01:40:54,728 --> 01:40:57,297
Just a few more until it’s complete!

1428
01:40:58,490 --> 01:41:03,871
I hope you get the merch
you’re looking for too.

1429
01:41:08,624 --> 01:41:13,013
Well, let’s continue where we left off.

1430
01:41:14,117 --> 01:41:18,852
The story up to this point
seems like a bit of a fairytale, but...

1431
01:41:19,077 --> 01:41:21,455
Make no mistake, it’s the truth.

1432
01:41:21,964 --> 01:41:26,874
Things are going to get more
and more bizarre from here on out.

1433
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:28,359
Yes.

1434
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:30,567
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.

1435
01:41:31,465 --> 01:41:35,828
Previously, the mansion was
shrouded in flames and burnt down...

1436
01:41:36,504 --> 01:41:39,519
But Mr. Joestar survived.

1437
01:41:40,346 --> 01:41:42,130
He beat Dio,

1438
01:41:42,782 --> 01:41:45,679
But lost everything.

1439
01:41:46,274 --> 01:41:48,820
Three days later...

1440
01:42:12,164 --> 01:42:13,337
I found it!

1441
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:15,361
The mask that man wore!

1442
01:42:15,467 --> 01:42:17,577
If I have this mask—

1443
01:42:17,585 --> 01:42:20,613
<i>JoJo...</i>

1444
01:42:21,522 --> 01:42:24,584
<i>JoJo...</i>

1445
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,513
<i>JoJo...</i>

1446
01:42:29,752 --> 01:42:32,960
<i>JoJo...</i>

1447
01:42:33,753 --> 01:42:37,896
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

1448
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,403
<i>My voice calling for you?</i>

1449
01:42:45,703 --> 01:42:50,481
After carrying the unconscious Mr. Joestar
to the hospital, I came back to visit him!

1450
01:42:50,504 --> 01:42:52,407
I’m not much,

1451
01:42:52,735 --> 01:42:56,155
But I want to do what I can at least,

1452
01:42:56,156 --> 01:42:58,198
To give him some small
hope to keep on living!

1453
01:42:59,758 --> 01:43:00,868
Can I help you?

1454
01:43:01,345 --> 01:43:03,356
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

1455
01:43:03,631 --> 01:43:05,378
But that’s why I’m here!

1456
01:43:05,378 --> 01:43:07,465
I’m doing enough for him as his nurse.

1457
01:43:07,465 --> 01:43:09,191
Please come back some other day.

1458
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:11,216
Is he alright?! Oi, hold it—

1459
01:43:23,654 --> 01:43:25,905
<i>JoJo...</i>

1460
01:43:27,842 --> 01:43:30,083
<i>JoJo...</i>

1461
01:43:32,785 --> 01:43:35,922
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1462
01:43:36,257 --> 01:43:39,865
<i>My voice,</i>

1463
01:43:39,866 --> 01:43:44,030
<i>You recognise it, right?</i>

1464
01:43:45,054 --> 01:43:53,040
<i>From that bright, fleeting moment
when we were drawn together</i>

1465
01:43:53,548 --> 01:43:59,012
<i>I want to hear your voice again too</i>

1466
01:44:05,342 --> 01:44:06,442
Where am I...?

1467
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:14,261
You slept for three whole days!

1468
01:44:15,843 --> 01:44:17,327
The mansion! Everyone is—

1469
01:44:17,328 --> 01:44:18,883
Please, just relax for now!

1470
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:22,155
You’ve made it through the worst
of it, but you’re still in bad shape!

1471
01:44:23,356 --> 01:44:25,338
I’m so glad you’re alive!

1472
01:44:25,616 --> 01:44:27,240
Have you been caring
for me this whole—

1473
01:44:28,116 --> 01:44:29,116
You’re—

1474
01:44:29,838 --> 01:44:30,938
No, it couldn’t be.

1475
01:44:33,043 --> 01:44:34,120
But you look like...

1476
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:36,407
Look like who?

1477
01:44:36,408 --> 01:44:38,084
Like Erina Pendleton?

1478
01:44:39,977 --> 01:44:42,956
It’s been a while, Jonathan Joestar.

1479
01:44:43,367 --> 01:44:44,367
How?

1480
01:44:44,635 --> 01:44:46,393
This is my father’s hospital.

1481
01:44:46,841 --> 01:44:51,097
We moved to India seven years
ago, and just recently returned.

1482
01:44:52,865 --> 01:44:54,701
It’s really been too long.

1483
01:44:55,985 --> 01:45:03,968
<i>I was weak back then,
I couldn’t run to your side</i>

1484
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:12,213
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

1485
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:16,289
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

1486
01:45:16,888 --> 01:45:20,460
<i>My feelings are still the same</i>

1487
01:45:20,925 --> 01:45:27,553
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

1488
01:45:28,527 --> 01:45:30,273
<i>Erina</i>

1489
01:45:30,517 --> 01:45:32,305
<i>JoJo</i>

1490
01:45:33,072 --> 01:45:36,024
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

1491
01:45:36,025 --> 01:45:43,884
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

1492
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:51,791
Erina!

1493
01:45:52,782 --> 01:45:55,505
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

1494
01:45:56,026 --> 01:45:58,002
My goodness, you caught
me with your broken arm!

1495
01:45:58,026 --> 01:45:59,849
I’ll always be there to catch you.

1496
01:46:01,064 --> 01:46:02,889
<i>When our</i>

1497
01:46:02,913 --> 01:46:04,913
<i>Eyes meet</i>

1498
01:46:05,643 --> 01:46:08,775
<i>I can see it there</i>

1499
01:46:08,775 --> 01:46:16,077
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

1500
01:46:17,122 --> 01:46:19,085
<i>Your hand</i>

1501
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:21,121
<i>Meets mine</i>

1502
01:46:21,705 --> 01:46:24,578
<i>I can feel you there</i>

1503
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:31,649
<i>Our fates entwined forever</i>

1504
01:46:32,093 --> 01:46:40,870
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

1505
01:46:41,085 --> 01:46:46,113
<i>Drawn together on that fleeting day</i>

1506
01:46:46,866 --> 01:46:50,877
<i>We’ll continue from there</i>

1507
01:46:50,878 --> 01:46:54,888
<i>Just the two of us</i>

1508
01:46:57,066 --> 01:46:59,426
Fate? That’s right.

1509
01:46:59,678 --> 01:47:05,566
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

1510
01:47:06,872 --> 01:47:10,003
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

1511
01:47:23,233 --> 01:47:28,010
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1512
01:47:28,683 --> 01:47:32,459
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

1513
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,637
<i>It was the same method, another woman—</i>

1514
01:47:35,638 --> 01:47:39,098
<i>Her throat was slit</i>

1515
01:47:39,099 --> 01:47:42,740
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

1516
01:47:43,221 --> 01:47:46,586
<i>The utmost cruelty!</i>

1517
01:47:46,804 --> 01:47:50,076
<i>No known motive at all!</i>

1518
01:47:50,084 --> 01:47:53,378
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

1519
01:47:53,543 --> 01:47:57,218
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

1520
01:47:57,585 --> 01:48:01,021
<i>(Don’t go out walking at night!)</i>

1521
01:48:01,188 --> 01:48:04,562
<i>(You’ll be killed! He’ll find you!)</i>

1522
01:48:04,594 --> 01:48:11,731
<i>(The plague of London,
that bloodthirsty killer!)</i>

1523
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:18,872
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

1524
01:48:18,873 --> 01:48:25,245
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

1525
01:48:25,245 --> 01:48:28,348
<i>Jack the Ripper!</i>

1526
01:48:29,165 --> 01:48:30,950
You’re kidding!

1527
01:48:31,221 --> 01:48:32,832
Oh, it’s already so late!

1528
01:48:33,475 --> 01:48:35,622
I have to return home soon...

1529
01:48:35,625 --> 01:48:38,196
It’s not late at all!

1530
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:41,895
But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!

1531
01:48:42,953 --> 01:48:44,970
It’s a terrifying thought!

1532
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:47,001
Terrifying, is it?

1533
01:48:47,002 --> 01:48:48,002
It is!

1534
01:48:49,554 --> 01:48:51,879
Well, as a matter of fact...

1535
01:48:52,046 --> 01:48:57,577
You’re talking with him right now!

1536
01:49:07,401 --> 01:49:10,149
You’re out playing too late,

1537
01:49:10,721 --> 01:49:15,495
You dirty harlot!

1538
01:49:20,831 --> 01:49:21,931
Who goes there?

1539
01:49:22,601 --> 01:49:23,856
You...

1540
01:49:24,862 --> 01:49:26,406
I like you.

1541
01:49:28,919 --> 01:49:31,260
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

1542
01:49:37,528 --> 01:49:42,925
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

1543
01:49:42,926 --> 01:49:47,823
<i>I’ve been reborn, now’s the
time for my life to start!</i>

1544
01:49:47,824 --> 01:49:52,943
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

1545
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,867
<i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>

1546
01:49:55,868 --> 01:49:59,239
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

1547
01:49:59,558 --> 01:50:01,804
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1548
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:06,176
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

1549
01:50:05,148 --> 01:50:06,248
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1550
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:11,574
Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

1551
01:50:11,574 --> 01:50:13,785
They fear that which is spectacularly evil.

1552
01:50:13,785 --> 01:50:16,706
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

1553
01:50:16,707 --> 01:50:21,380
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

1554
01:50:21,672 --> 01:50:24,091
How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?

1555
01:50:24,091 --> 01:50:27,275
What do you know about me?!

1556
01:50:29,727 --> 01:50:34,841
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

1557
01:50:34,842 --> 01:50:37,363
<i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>

1558
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:40,015
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

1559
01:50:40,029 --> 01:50:45,367
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

1560
01:50:45,367 --> 01:50:48,264
Me, afraid?!

1561
01:50:45,407 --> 01:50:47,955
{\an8}<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1562
01:50:48,328 --> 01:50:49,589
That’s right!

1563
01:50:48,111 --> 01:50:49,211
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1564
01:50:50,531 --> 01:50:53,333
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

1565
01:50:53,334 --> 01:50:56,604
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

1566
01:50:56,605 --> 01:51:00,801
<i>I’m not scared of anything!</i>

1567
01:51:00,873 --> 01:51:06,325
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

1568
01:51:06,325 --> 01:51:07,325
<i>You—</i>

1569
01:51:07,340 --> 01:51:10,809
<i>Come to my side, Jack the Ripper!</i>

1570
01:51:10,810 --> 01:51:14,109
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1571
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:17,029
<i>Who are you?</i>

1572
01:51:17,145 --> 01:51:21,669
<i>Seeing stars, or seeing mud?</i>

1573
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:27,560
<i>We’ll change the tune of
that tired old philosophy!</i>

1574
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:31,805
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

1575
01:51:31,806 --> 01:51:37,448
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

1576
01:51:37,675 --> 01:51:40,072
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1577
01:51:38,112 --> 01:51:41,421
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

1578
01:51:40,258 --> 01:51:42,644
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1579
01:51:42,842 --> 01:51:45,344
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1580
01:51:45,445 --> 01:51:47,079
{\an8}<i>(Blood! Flesh!)</i>

1581
01:51:46,848 --> 01:51:53,219
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1582
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:25,010
The Stone Mask...

1583
01:52:26,693 --> 01:52:29,659
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

1584
01:52:30,922 --> 01:52:31,858
Yes.

1585
01:52:32,983 --> 01:52:34,083
It has to have been.

1586
01:52:37,658 --> 01:52:38,758
It’s alright.

1587
01:52:39,483 --> 01:52:40,583
I’m alright.

1588
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,704
Let’s go.

1589
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:46,740
Eh?

1590
01:52:47,269 --> 01:52:48,369
What’s wrong?

1591
01:52:48,864 --> 01:52:49,964
Who’s that?

1592
01:52:50,864 --> 01:52:51,806
Has he been here
this whole time?

1593
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:53,484
Jonathan Joestar!

1594
01:52:54,118 --> 01:52:57,087
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

1595
01:53:01,789 --> 01:53:06,123
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

1596
01:53:06,123 --> 01:53:07,287
The Stone Mask?!

1597
01:53:10,176 --> 01:53:10,927
JoJo!

1598
01:53:13,397 --> 01:53:14,500
<i>(Pow!)</i>

1599
01:53:14,914 --> 01:53:16,636
<i>Squeeze out</i>

1600
01:53:17,365 --> 01:53:18,738
<i>Every last ounce</i>

1601
01:53:20,027 --> 01:53:23,245
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

1602
01:53:23,309 --> 01:53:25,021
How could you, he’s injured!

1603
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:29,631
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

1604
01:53:29,639 --> 01:53:32,018
<i>I am Baron Zeppeli!</i>

1605
01:53:32,228 --> 01:53:36,314
<i>Courage alone won’t defeat
the power of the Stone Mask</i>

1606
01:53:36,315 --> 01:53:38,442
<i>I am on your side!</i>

1607
01:53:39,207 --> 01:53:43,890
<i>I manipulated your breath, your
breath made the pain go away</i>

1608
01:53:43,891 --> 01:53:47,986
<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

1609
01:53:48,335 --> 01:53:49,403
Who are you?

1610
01:53:49,404 --> 01:53:51,046
What did you do to me?!

1611
01:53:51,046 --> 01:53:52,514
How do you know my name!

1612
01:53:52,514 --> 01:53:56,809
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

1613
01:53:57,252 --> 01:54:01,014
<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

1614
01:54:01,472 --> 01:54:05,395
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

1615
01:54:05,514 --> 01:54:08,003
<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>

1616
01:54:08,004 --> 01:54:10,401
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

1617
01:54:15,154 --> 01:54:16,996
What will happen now?

1618
01:54:18,582 --> 01:54:22,930
<i>Let me demonstrate for you</i>

1619
01:54:23,564 --> 01:54:28,355
<i>The power that this breathing awakens!</i>

1620
01:54:28,848 --> 01:54:30,753
<i>(Breathe in, breathe out)</i>

1621
01:54:31,038 --> 01:54:32,411
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1622
01:54:33,419 --> 01:54:34,792
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1623
01:54:35,736 --> 01:54:37,276
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1624
01:54:37,276 --> 01:54:38,276
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1625
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,609
<i>With this special breathing</i>

1626
01:54:38,903 --> 01:54:40,181
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1627
01:54:39,903 --> 01:54:42,169
<i>You carry special oxygen</i>

1628
01:54:41,268 --> 01:54:42,755
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1629
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,283
<i>In the blood it sends racing</i>

1630
01:54:44,307 --> 01:54:46,615
<i>All throughout your body!</i>

1631
01:54:46,583 --> 01:54:47,583
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1632
01:54:46,631 --> 01:54:48,961
<i>And energy is born!</i>

1633
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:49,504
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1634
01:54:49,512 --> 01:54:51,530
<i>Its name is—</i>

1635
01:54:50,561 --> 01:54:51,964
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1636
01:54:51,531 --> 01:54:53,809
<i>Ripple Energy!</i>

1637
01:55:03,736 --> 01:55:05,196
<i>(Memetaa!)</i>

1638
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:05,190
{\an8}[TN: Sound of a frog being punched]

1639
01:55:05,197 --> 01:55:09,348
<i>The ripple’s power
passes through the frog</i>

1640
01:55:10,179 --> 01:55:13,854
<i>Making this miracle happen—</i>

1641
01:55:14,092 --> 01:55:17,757
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

1642
01:55:17,757 --> 01:55:22,729
<i>The power this breathing
infuses into your blood!</i>

1643
01:55:24,613 --> 01:55:25,986
<i>(In, out)</i>

1644
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,452
<i>(In, out)</i>

1645
01:55:28,491 --> 01:55:29,278
Breathing?

1646
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:33,089
Everyone has a little bit of energy
flowing through their bloodstream.

1647
01:55:33,095 --> 01:55:35,944
It does things like carry nutrients
and regulate your body temperature.

1648
01:55:35,944 --> 01:55:40,317
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.

1649
01:55:40,317 --> 01:55:43,925
This is made possible by the rhythm
of a particular breathing technique.

1650
01:55:43,926 --> 01:55:45,299
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!

1651
01:55:45,322 --> 01:55:47,623
Yes! The power of breathing!

1652
01:55:49,092 --> 01:55:50,655
In, out!

1653
01:55:52,052 --> 01:55:54,427
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

1654
01:55:54,439 --> 01:55:58,050
<i>They’re two sides of the same coin,
this breathing and the Stone Mask</i>

1655
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:00,256
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

1656
01:56:00,264 --> 01:56:00,672
Dio!

1657
01:56:00,672 --> 01:56:01,306
Yes!

1658
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:05,038
<i>The mask is not broken—he has it!</i>

1659
01:56:05,437 --> 01:56:09,564
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

1660
01:56:09,659 --> 01:56:13,546
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

1661
01:56:13,841 --> 01:56:15,943
<i>Pursuing the mask</i>

1662
01:56:15,982 --> 01:56:18,051
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

1663
01:56:18,075 --> 01:56:19,639
Dio is alive?!

1664
01:56:19,734 --> 01:56:20,734
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1665
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:22,112
<i>We must fight!</i>

1666
01:56:21,438 --> 01:56:22,652
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1667
01:56:22,604 --> 01:56:24,088
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

1668
01:56:23,803 --> 01:56:25,113
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1669
01:56:24,739 --> 01:56:29,096
<i>And you must wield this
ripple energy, or you will die! </i>

1670
01:56:29,134 --> 01:56:31,797
<i>That’s right, your fate,
and the fate of the world</i>

1671
01:56:30,737 --> 01:56:32,300
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1672
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,753
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

1673
01:56:33,071 --> 01:56:34,172
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1674
01:56:34,053 --> 01:56:36,102
<i>I finally found it!</i>

1675
01:56:38,695 --> 01:56:42,908
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

1676
01:56:42,909 --> 01:56:47,113
<i>Are all tied together. This is—</i>

1677
01:56:48,629 --> 01:56:50,040
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1678
01:56:50,937 --> 01:56:52,337
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1679
01:56:53,151 --> 01:56:54,551
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1680
01:56:55,613 --> 01:56:56,606
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1681
01:56:57,878 --> 01:57:04,564
<i>Destiny!</i>

1682
01:57:09,687 --> 01:57:13,906
To fight... That is my destiny!

1683
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:16,676
Mine and Dio’s!

1684
01:57:18,463 --> 01:57:22,146
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

1685
01:57:22,147 --> 01:57:23,985
That turns humans into vampires.

1686
01:57:23,986 --> 01:57:27,990
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

1687
01:57:28,184 --> 01:57:33,893
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

1688
01:57:33,893 --> 01:57:36,223
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

1689
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:40,533
Ah, let’s put it this way.

1690
01:57:43,805 --> 01:57:47,206
What must you do to stop that ripple?

1691
01:57:49,587 --> 01:57:51,043
I think I’ve got it!

1692
01:57:56,164 --> 01:57:57,214
Use a ripple!

1693
01:57:57,215 --> 01:58:01,092
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

1694
01:58:01,116 --> 01:58:04,056
And that wave of energy

1695
01:58:04,131 --> 01:58:07,694
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

1696
01:58:07,695 --> 01:58:08,516
You see?

1697
01:58:08,517 --> 01:58:09,786
The power to defeat Dio!

1698
01:58:09,807 --> 01:58:12,164
We’re already out of time.

1699
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,370
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

1700
01:58:18,892 --> 01:58:19,892
JoJo?

1701
01:58:20,965 --> 01:58:22,065
What do you mean, Dio?

1702
01:58:23,574 --> 01:58:24,574
Erina...

1703
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,027
I can’t get you involved in this!

1704
01:58:30,111 --> 01:58:31,869
For now, please just go along with it!

1705
01:58:31,870 --> 01:58:34,020
I swear I’ll come back here again.

1706
01:58:34,949 --> 01:58:36,075
How...?

1707
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:41,527
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

1708
01:59:06,994 --> 01:59:14,694
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>

1709
01:59:16,462 --> 01:59:18,764
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>

1710
01:59:20,724 --> 01:59:28,608
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

1711
01:59:29,928 --> 01:59:32,311
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>

1712
01:59:34,206 --> 01:59:39,152
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1713
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:46,578
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1714
01:59:47,919 --> 02:00:00,372
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>

1715
02:00:00,744 --> 02:00:03,077
<i>I am left behind</i>

1716
02:00:08,624 --> 02:00:14,815
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

1717
02:00:15,005 --> 02:00:20,092
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

1718
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:28,786
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

1719
02:00:28,786 --> 02:00:30,736
<i>I want to scream!</i>

1720
02:00:31,921 --> 02:00:34,384
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

1721
02:00:35,865 --> 02:00:40,713
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

1722
02:00:40,794 --> 02:00:48,739
<i>Forever guided by fate</i>

1723
02:00:49,184 --> 02:00:56,112
<i>I’ll live my days, spinning its thread</i>

1724
02:00:56,299 --> 02:01:00,635
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>

1725
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,069
<i>Waiting right here</i>

1726
02:01:10,003 --> 02:01:14,249
<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>

1727
02:01:14,249 --> 02:01:20,794
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>

1728
02:01:23,384 --> 02:01:27,099
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>

1729
02:01:27,099 --> 02:01:31,575
<i>So that I can call this
destiny one of love</i>

1730
02:01:31,825 --> 02:01:36,449
<i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>

1731
02:01:36,754 --> 02:01:37,484
JoJo!

1732
02:01:37,484 --> 02:01:42,247
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1733
02:01:42,514 --> 02:01:50,182
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1734
02:01:50,505 --> 02:01:55,243
<i>Our stars shine together</i>

1735
02:01:55,386 --> 02:02:02,344
<i>No matter where you are, I will, I will,</i>

1736
02:02:02,463 --> 02:02:06,136
<i>I will live on!</i>

1737
02:02:09,064 --> 02:02:13,438
<i>I will live on!</i>

1738
02:02:16,928 --> 02:02:25,551
<i>I will live on!</i>

1739
02:02:38,438 --> 02:02:41,335
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

1740
02:02:41,382 --> 02:02:42,382
Yep!

1741
02:02:51,962 --> 02:02:52,962
C’mere!

1742
02:03:03,159 --> 02:03:04,976
Why are you so strong?!

1743
02:03:05,255 --> 02:03:07,961
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!

1744
02:03:07,985 --> 02:03:12,765
Speeeedwagon!

1745
02:03:14,786 --> 02:03:19,722
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

1746
02:03:19,723 --> 02:03:20,906
JOJO: Stop right there!

1747
02:03:22,015 --> 02:03:23,015
Mr. Joestar!

1748
02:03:24,889 --> 02:03:27,929
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

1749
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:33,320
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

1750
02:03:33,321 --> 02:03:35,110
Licky licky? Licky licky!

1751
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:36,816
Licky licky! Licky licky!

1752
02:03:36,817 --> 02:03:38,024
Lickithan Joestar.

1753
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:39,856
JoJo, be careful.

1754
02:03:39,857 --> 02:03:41,452
He’s strong enough to rival you.

1755
02:03:41,453 --> 02:03:43,078
What was that, you old fart?

1756
02:03:43,102 --> 02:03:43,935
<i>Old fart?</i>

1757
02:03:43,959 --> 02:03:45,546
Time for a taste!

1758
02:03:56,879 --> 02:04:02,735
His arm... got longer!

1759
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:24,260
It’s useless.

1760
02:04:25,692 --> 02:04:29,975
I’ve been given new life!

1761
02:04:31,177 --> 02:04:34,264
And a body that transcends humanit—

1762
02:04:34,264 --> 02:04:36,782
That’s not what’s important here.

1763
02:04:42,154 --> 02:04:43,889
M-My body...

1764
02:04:45,487 --> 02:04:46,550
It’s hot!

1765
02:04:46,551 --> 02:04:49,385
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!

1766
02:04:49,385 --> 02:04:50,961
Ah! Wait!

1767
02:04:56,463 --> 02:04:57,675
It’s amazing!

1768
02:04:58,038 --> 02:05:01,473
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.

1769
02:05:04,063 --> 02:05:06,112
What’s wrong, JoJo?

1770
02:05:08,213 --> 02:05:11,450
I lost so much...

1771
02:05:12,895 --> 02:05:14,885
That’s why I wanted power.

1772
02:05:16,274 --> 02:05:19,528
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

1773
02:05:19,536 --> 02:05:24,196
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!

1774
02:05:24,202 --> 02:05:25,788
But it’s the same power!

1775
02:05:26,877 --> 02:05:29,802
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:

1776
02:05:31,192 --> 02:05:34,606
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”

1777
02:05:35,621 --> 02:05:39,545
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

1778
02:05:39,545 --> 02:05:41,936
They became vikings with backbone!

1779
02:05:42,555 --> 02:05:44,416
You are different from Dio and his ilk!

1780
02:05:45,358 --> 02:05:47,157
Because you feel the pain.

1781
02:05:48,088 --> 02:05:49,188
Pain...

1782
02:05:50,898 --> 02:05:54,477
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>

1783
02:05:54,897 --> 02:05:58,579
<i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>

1784
02:05:58,658 --> 02:06:01,848
<i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>

1785
02:06:01,848 --> 02:06:05,999
<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

1786
02:06:05,999 --> 02:06:08,099
You need to listen to that pain!

1787
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:16,749
<i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>

1788
02:06:18,406 --> 02:06:22,788
<i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>

1789
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:32,731
<i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>

1790
02:06:33,575 --> 02:06:42,673
<i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>

1791
02:06:42,961 --> 02:06:47,048
<i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>

1792
02:06:47,156 --> 02:06:50,394
<i>Staining the darkness red</i>

1793
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:54,521
<i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>

1794
02:06:54,522 --> 02:06:58,191
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1795
02:06:58,870 --> 02:07:00,933
It was pure coincidence!

1796
02:07:00,933 --> 02:07:03,662
I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

1797
02:07:03,673 --> 02:07:04,773
What was that?!

1798
02:07:06,447 --> 02:07:13,294
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>

1799
02:07:13,579 --> 02:07:20,724
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>

1800
02:07:20,765 --> 02:07:23,805
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>

1801
02:07:24,421 --> 02:07:27,613
<i>The mask burst with light</i>

1802
02:07:28,086 --> 02:07:35,260
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>

1803
02:07:35,387 --> 02:07:36,595
Mr. Zeppeli!

1804
02:07:36,942 --> 02:07:39,759
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>

1805
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:44,148
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>

1806
02:07:44,148 --> 02:07:49,942
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>

1807
02:07:49,957 --> 02:07:51,891
It was my father!

1808
02:07:52,812 --> 02:07:58,584
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>

1809
02:07:59,700 --> 02:08:04,656
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>

1810
02:08:04,968 --> 02:08:11,830
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1811
02:08:12,034 --> 02:08:15,516
<i>ZEP: I’ve been chasing after it
JOJO: So that it won’t repeat</i>

1812
02:08:15,516 --> 02:08:18,937
<i>ZEP: I swore to take revenge
JOJO: I won’t let you down!</i>

1813
02:08:18,937 --> 02:08:21,396
<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be
JOJO: Shining bright</i>

1814
02:08:21,396 --> 02:08:28,847
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>

1815
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:34,987
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!

1816
02:08:36,388 --> 02:08:39,091
And the resolve to face the consequences.

1817
02:08:43,073 --> 02:08:44,629
JoJo!

1818
02:08:48,892 --> 02:08:49,992
Hey JoJo.

1819
02:08:51,654 --> 02:08:53,172
JoJo JoJo JoJo.

1820
02:08:54,042 --> 02:08:55,473
Ha-hey JoJo.

1821
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:58,771
Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.

1822
02:09:00,612 --> 02:09:03,818
Don’t forget this goal.

1823
02:09:05,078 --> 02:09:06,078
Yes, sir.

1824
02:09:07,119 --> 02:09:09,921
I believe in the power of the ripple.

1825
02:09:09,988 --> 02:09:10,988
Yep.

1826
02:09:11,228 --> 02:09:12,691
I like your fringe.

1827
02:09:13,839 --> 02:09:14,839
JoJo!

1828
02:09:15,085 --> 02:09:16,494
Hey JoJo, JoJo!

1829
02:09:40,627 --> 02:09:42,988
Why, why?!

1830
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:51,982
Jonathan Joestar!

1831
02:09:53,567 --> 02:09:57,125
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

1832
02:09:58,168 --> 02:09:59,638
Are you angry?

1833
02:10:00,586 --> 02:10:02,330
You’re good company, huh?

1834
02:10:02,331 --> 02:10:04,521
Oh! It burns! It burns!

1835
02:10:04,838 --> 02:10:06,203
My body, it—

1836
02:10:08,179 --> 02:10:09,473
Is that Mr. Horse?

1837
02:10:09,474 --> 02:10:12,970
Look Wang Chan!
Your, your ancestors—

1838
02:10:12,971 --> 02:10:14,429
Clippity clop, clippity clop!

1839
02:10:15,763 --> 02:10:18,038
There he is.

1840
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:23,008
<i>The lovable sweetheart, Mr. Joestar,
has finally got a handle on the ripple</i>

1841
02:10:23,033 --> 02:10:25,233
<i>Hey yo yo! We’re coming
to collect payment</i>

1842
02:10:25,257 --> 02:10:27,122
<i>These bills been piling piling up</i>

1843
02:10:27,147 --> 02:10:30,980
<i>Your underworld rep, AKA
Speedwagon, is here to give a full report</i>

1844
02:10:31,005 --> 02:10:33,369
<i>Who else would be your guide</i>

1845
02:10:33,393 --> 02:10:36,582
<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>

1846
02:10:36,607 --> 02:10:38,416
<i>South of London, in total daylight,</i>

1847
02:10:38,441 --> 02:10:39,977
<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

1848
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,478
<i>When we pass through this
tunnel, you’ll see the sights</i>

1849
02:10:42,503 --> 02:10:44,228
<i>That famous city of knights</i>

1850
02:10:44,228 --> 02:10:46,327
<i>This is Windknight’s Lot</i>

1851
02:10:46,351 --> 02:10:48,247
<i>A natural fortress like an augite rock</i>

1852
02:10:48,272 --> 02:10:50,160
<i>Windknight’s Lot</i>

1853
02:10:50,184 --> 02:10:51,832
<i>Fate’ll have it—Dio’s hideout</i>

1854
02:10:51,866 --> 02:10:53,771
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1855
02:10:53,795 --> 02:10:55,691
<i>We’ll knock it out</i>

1856
02:10:55,715 --> 02:10:57,580
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1857
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,532
<i>Clean this vampire nest out</i>

1858
02:10:59,557 --> 02:11:01,898
<i>Ay, Dio, dick, you make me sick</i>

1859
02:11:01,922 --> 02:11:03,834
<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>

1860
02:11:03,858 --> 02:11:05,797
<i>No more tomorrows Dio, that’s it</i>

1861
02:11:05,837 --> 02:11:07,837
<i>Now’s the end, ya gonna get hit!</i>

1862
02:11:09,464 --> 02:11:11,614
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.

1863
02:11:11,614 --> 02:11:15,241
My underground sources say that
Wang Chan definitely fled here.

1864
02:11:15,242 --> 02:11:18,163
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

1865
02:11:18,178 --> 02:11:20,630
It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.

1866
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:23,088
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

1867
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:25,023
Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.

1868
02:11:27,628 --> 02:11:30,072
Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?

1869
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,798
Whaaat?!

1870
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:36,671
Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.

1871
02:11:41,292 --> 02:11:43,022
L-Look!

1872
02:11:43,022 --> 02:11:44,976
T-The horse!!

1873
02:11:53,956 --> 02:11:55,687
What is he...

1874
02:11:57,687 --> 02:11:59,663
He’s inside the horse’s body!

1875
02:12:03,132 --> 02:12:07,527
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!

1876
02:12:17,023 --> 02:12:17,672
Mr. Joestar!

1877
02:12:17,673 --> 02:12:19,103
Stand down, you two.

1878
02:12:19,126 --> 02:12:20,645
I will fight!

1879
02:12:33,739 --> 02:12:35,642
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!

1880
02:12:35,643 --> 02:12:37,127
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

1881
02:12:37,134 --> 02:12:39,951
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

1882
02:12:39,959 --> 02:12:42,030
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

1883
02:12:42,030 --> 02:12:44,413
What are you yammering on about!

1884
02:12:44,564 --> 02:12:46,653
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

1885
02:12:46,657 --> 02:12:48,379
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

1886
02:12:48,379 --> 02:12:50,974
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

1887
02:12:50,975 --> 02:12:53,265
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!

1888
02:12:53,273 --> 02:12:55,518
The hymn of humanity
is a song of courage!

1889
02:12:56,256 --> 02:12:59,787
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

1890
02:13:00,760 --> 02:13:04,269
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

1891
02:13:04,353 --> 02:13:06,028
They’re just like fleas!

1892
02:13:08,016 --> 02:13:11,500
Hot, so hot!

1893
02:13:12,047 --> 02:13:14,934
How dare you! I’ll kill you!

1894
02:13:15,236 --> 02:13:19,572
Yes... I’ll eat every
shred of you in one bite!

1895
02:13:25,168 --> 02:13:26,930
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!

1896
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:28,447
Windknight’s Lot...

1897
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:31,869
I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.

1898
02:13:31,874 --> 02:13:34,477
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

1899
02:13:34,485 --> 02:13:37,883
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

1900
02:13:37,884 --> 02:13:40,960
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

1901
02:14:04,594 --> 02:14:06,471
Can you hear me?

1902
02:14:07,185 --> 02:14:10,121
Sleeping knights...

1903
02:14:24,353 --> 02:14:28,998
<i>Follow me, serve royalty once again</i>

1904
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:33,362
<i>Get your revenge on the past,
let’s rewrite history</i>

1905
02:14:33,522 --> 02:14:38,228
<i>Upend righteousness,
go for total victory</i>

1906
02:14:38,441 --> 02:14:43,722
<i>That’s this world, the
unwavering world of Dio</i>

1907
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:48,893
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1908
02:14:52,218 --> 02:14:56,609
<i>Your long silence has
left this world to rot</i>

1909
02:14:56,760 --> 02:15:01,306
<i>Now raise your voices,
from crushed throats</i>

1910
02:15:01,331 --> 02:15:05,777
<i>Crying out from the mud,
conquer the stars</i>

1911
02:15:05,777 --> 02:15:08,428
<i>I’ll allow you this and more!</i>

1912
02:15:08,429 --> 02:15:10,453
<i>(My sword, it’s yours!)</i>

1913
02:15:11,274 --> 02:15:15,058
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices)</i>

1914
02:15:11,883 --> 02:15:15,353
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1915
02:15:15,059 --> 02:15:20,058
<i>(We’ve been sleeping for 300 years,
us rotten and forgotten corpses)</i>

1916
02:15:16,788 --> 02:15:20,010
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1917
02:15:20,504 --> 02:15:23,710
<i>Get your revenge!</i>

1918
02:15:24,001 --> 02:15:30,318
<i>300 years asleep, haunted
by painful thoughts</i>

1919
02:15:29,136 --> 02:15:31,269
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1920
02:15:31,452 --> 02:15:33,705
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1921
02:15:33,848 --> 02:15:35,940
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1922
02:15:36,698 --> 02:15:38,276
Wait, Dio!

1923
02:15:38,397 --> 02:15:40,611
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1924
02:15:40,707 --> 02:15:42,948
Come quick, JoJo.

1925
02:15:43,048 --> 02:15:45,183
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1926
02:15:45,278 --> 02:15:49,269
My world is in the palm of my hand now!

1927
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:49,521
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1928
02:15:52,202 --> 02:15:54,526
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1929
02:15:54,526 --> 02:15:56,869
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1930
02:15:57,091 --> 02:16:00,699
<i>I will dominate life at last,</i>

1931
02:16:01,154 --> 02:16:06,304
<i>Tearing its natural
order from God’s grasp</i>

1932
02:16:06,617 --> 02:16:09,974
<i>I will dominate history too,</i>

1933
02:16:10,085 --> 02:16:15,580
<i>Rewriting and upending it anew</i>

1934
02:16:15,896 --> 02:16:19,063
<i>I will dominate even time,</i>

1935
02:16:19,064 --> 02:16:22,943
<i>My body eternal and sublime</i>

1936
02:16:21,894 --> 02:16:24,759
{\an8}<i>(Eternal life!)</i>

1937
02:16:25,108 --> 02:16:32,942
<i>I will dominate everything,
rise above all my cares</i>

1938
02:16:31,204 --> 02:16:34,006
{\an8}<i>(We vow to steal them away!)</i>

1939
02:16:34,133 --> 02:16:38,594
<i>Win it all, negate righteousness</i>

1940
02:16:38,594 --> 02:16:42,407
<i>In this peacefully unaware country</i>

1941
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:43,431
{\an8}<i>(This country is ours!)</i>

1942
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:49,349
<i>I will dominate everything,
I’ll face them now</i>

1943
02:16:49,361 --> 02:16:52,684
<i>And demand peace of mind!</i>

1944
02:16:52,202 --> 02:16:54,318
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1945
02:16:53,407 --> 02:16:58,582
<i>My world, this world!</i>

1946
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:56,687
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1947
02:16:59,113 --> 02:17:00,256
<i>Wry wry!</i>

1948
02:17:00,256 --> 02:17:05,096
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1949
02:17:13,453 --> 02:17:15,773
It’s melting...

1950
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:18,209
It’s really melting away...

1951
02:17:18,209 --> 02:17:20,445
So much that there’s a hole in my cheek...

1952
02:17:20,668 --> 02:17:22,547
My tongue is sticking out of the hole!

1953
02:17:22,906 --> 02:17:24,571
Your cheek is melting,

1954
02:17:26,334 --> 02:17:28,968
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?

1955
02:17:28,968 --> 02:17:29,682
Dio!

1956
02:17:29,682 --> 02:17:30,682
Oh, it really is.

1957
02:17:34,277 --> 02:17:36,327
The sun has set.

1958
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:42,166
It’s time for your lives
to go down with it!

1959
02:17:42,482 --> 02:17:45,571
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!

1960
02:17:45,673 --> 02:17:47,743
Even so, I can’t help
this feeling of dread.

1961
02:17:47,743 --> 02:17:49,814
As a human, I can’t let
you get away with this!

1962
02:17:49,823 --> 02:17:50,823
JoJo!

1963
02:17:51,863 --> 02:17:53,569
Put your training to use.

1964
02:18:05,128 --> 02:18:08,332
<i>(We’ll feast! On your blood and flesh!)</i>

1965
02:18:09,175 --> 02:18:10,939
<i>(Steal it away!)</i>

1966
02:18:11,884 --> 02:18:14,545
<i>(To heal all of our wounds!)</i>

1967
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:17,534
<i>JoJo, here’s a lesson for you</i>

1968
02:18:18,787 --> 02:18:24,142
<i>The north wind made the vikings!</i>

1969
02:18:24,221 --> 02:18:25,626
This battle will be an exercise—

1970
02:18:25,626 --> 02:18:28,652
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!

1971
02:18:28,674 --> 02:18:31,593
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!

1972
02:18:31,624 --> 02:18:33,589
The north wind made the vikings!

1973
02:18:34,486 --> 02:18:37,427
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—

1974
02:18:42,738 --> 02:18:47,174
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>

1975
02:18:47,427 --> 02:18:51,233
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>

1976
02:18:50,857 --> 02:18:51,998
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1977
02:18:52,061 --> 02:18:56,593
<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>

1978
02:18:56,618 --> 02:19:00,992
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1979
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:05,041
<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>

1980
02:19:05,394 --> 02:19:09,731
<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>

1981
02:19:09,910 --> 02:19:15,681
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

1982
02:19:16,146 --> 02:19:18,458
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1983
02:19:22,247 --> 02:19:23,303
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>

1984
02:19:22,461 --> 02:19:24,736
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>

1985
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:25,170
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1986
02:19:24,774 --> 02:19:26,791
<i>The ripple of the wine!</i>

1987
02:19:26,106 --> 02:19:27,918
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1988
02:19:27,406 --> 02:19:31,608
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my
way through the darkness!</i>

1989
02:19:31,696 --> 02:19:34,036
<i>The waves of the ripple!</i>

1990
02:19:33,135 --> 02:19:34,463
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1991
02:19:34,145 --> 02:19:36,297
<i>Are resounding through my body!</i>

1992
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:36,638
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1993
02:19:36,424 --> 02:19:38,416
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>

1994
02:19:38,416 --> 02:19:41,199
<i>Find your way through the darkness!</i>

1995
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:44,684
<i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>

1996
02:19:45,134 --> 02:19:51,046
<i>Pa-pow-pow-pow with unrelenting heat!</i>

1997
02:19:49,185 --> 02:19:50,185
{\an8}<i>(Heat!)</i>

1998
02:19:51,112 --> 02:19:52,207
<i>Sunlight...</i>

1999
02:19:52,231 --> 02:19:53,364
<i>(Sunlight...)</i>

2000
02:19:53,364 --> 02:19:54,553
<i>Yellow...</i>

2001
02:19:54,577 --> 02:19:55,765
<i>(Yellow...)</i>

2002
02:19:55,767 --> 02:19:56,788
<i>Over...</i>

2003
02:19:56,812 --> 02:19:57,451
<i>(Over!)</i>

2004
02:19:57,476 --> 02:19:59,109
<i>Sunlight yellow, sunlight yellow</i>

2005
02:19:59,110 --> 02:20:07,813
<i>Overdrive!!</i>

2006
02:20:14,182 --> 02:20:16,656
The ripple of the sun! Dio!

2007
02:20:16,656 --> 02:20:19,164
This is the power
that will defeat you!

2008
02:20:22,751 --> 02:20:24,340
Dio Brando?

2009
02:20:24,372 --> 02:20:25,372
Yeah?

2010
02:20:25,758 --> 02:20:28,027
I don’t know you, but...

2011
02:20:29,067 --> 02:20:34,138
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:

2012
02:20:35,391 --> 02:20:37,408
Finally, we meet.

2013
02:20:37,728 --> 02:20:39,644
Don’t get carried away!

2014
02:20:44,856 --> 02:20:50,000
Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.

2015
02:20:52,661 --> 02:20:55,293
You’re the one who put it there!

2016
02:20:55,946 --> 02:21:00,565
Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.

2017
02:21:02,137 --> 02:21:04,597
I’ll be using your lives...

2018
02:21:05,041 --> 02:21:08,333
To purge this wound!

2019
02:21:08,334 --> 02:21:09,619
You bastard!

2020
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:13,594
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?

2021
02:21:20,169 --> 02:21:28,833
Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?

2022
02:21:34,688 --> 02:21:37,204
I’ll make you submit!

2023
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:40,609
By the ripple of the sun!

2024
02:21:41,764 --> 02:21:42,974
Pow!

2025
02:21:43,341 --> 02:21:46,627
Utterly pathetic!

2026
02:21:46,645 --> 02:21:48,422
It’s freezing?!

2027
02:21:48,515 --> 02:21:53,210
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!

2028
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:57,895
I am able to control my own body at will.

2029
02:21:58,993 --> 02:22:01,727
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2030
02:22:02,042 --> 02:22:04,929
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2031
02:22:05,628 --> 02:22:07,771
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2032
02:22:08,382 --> 02:22:09,601
Mr. Zeppeli!

2033
02:22:12,016 --> 02:22:14,805
Useless, useless, useless, useless!

2034
02:22:16,522 --> 02:22:20,077
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2035
02:22:21,319 --> 02:22:23,995
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,

2036
02:22:23,995 --> 02:22:29,220
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2037
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:40,121
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.

2038
02:22:40,122 --> 02:22:42,031
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...

2039
02:22:43,367 --> 02:22:46,733
That’s right. Do you remember?

2040
02:22:47,117 --> 02:22:51,466
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?

2041
02:22:51,491 --> 02:22:52,494
What?

2042
02:22:52,532 --> 02:22:57,715
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2043
02:22:57,824 --> 02:23:01,752
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2044
02:23:02,238 --> 02:23:04,389
Mary Stuart!

2045
02:23:05,577 --> 02:23:07,417
It was about the ones who served her!

2046
02:23:08,085 --> 02:23:12,634
The story of those two proud knights...

2047
02:23:13,205 --> 02:23:14,182
Father told us...

2048
02:23:14,206 --> 02:23:15,206
Yes!

2049
02:23:15,519 --> 02:23:19,203
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

2050
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:22,812
JoJo, Dio!

2051
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:25,539
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,

2052
02:23:25,564 --> 02:23:28,210
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2053
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:32,138
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—

2054
02:23:32,139 --> 02:23:35,220
This is a story of knightly pride!

2055
02:23:37,133 --> 02:23:41,552
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

2056
02:23:41,729 --> 02:23:46,074
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2057
02:23:46,226 --> 02:23:50,612
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>

2058
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:54,847
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2059
02:23:55,183 --> 02:23:59,285
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>

2060
02:23:59,721 --> 02:24:03,205
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>

2061
02:24:04,276 --> 02:24:12,373
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2062
02:24:12,474 --> 02:24:21,466
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>

2063
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:26,788
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>

2064
02:24:26,789 --> 02:24:30,908
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2065
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:35,717
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>

2066
02:24:35,718 --> 02:24:39,968
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2067
02:24:40,412 --> 02:24:44,331
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,

2068
02:24:44,332 --> 02:24:48,494
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2069
02:24:49,457 --> 02:24:53,450
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

2070
02:24:53,708 --> 02:24:57,853
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>

2071
02:24:58,203 --> 02:25:02,633
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>

2072
02:25:02,658 --> 02:25:07,065
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2073
02:25:07,112 --> 02:25:11,447
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2074
02:25:11,613 --> 02:25:16,113
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2075
02:25:16,113 --> 02:25:24,434
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2076
02:25:24,475 --> 02:25:29,254
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2077
02:25:29,279 --> 02:25:34,458
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2078
02:25:34,801 --> 02:25:36,934
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2079
02:25:36,958 --> 02:25:39,370
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!

2080
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:41,860
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2081
02:25:41,916 --> 02:25:44,187
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2082
02:25:44,234 --> 02:25:47,513
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2083
02:25:47,554 --> 02:25:52,100
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2084
02:25:56,699 --> 02:26:00,394
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2085
02:26:00,419 --> 02:26:05,295
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2086
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:10,175
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2087
02:26:10,214 --> 02:26:14,674
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>

2088
02:26:14,710 --> 02:26:18,814
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2089
02:26:18,839 --> 02:26:23,674
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2090
02:26:23,714 --> 02:26:27,073
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2091
02:26:27,097 --> 02:26:29,160
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2092
02:26:29,161 --> 02:26:36,557
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2093
02:26:38,859 --> 02:26:46,161
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2094
02:26:46,478 --> 02:26:48,171
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!

2095
02:26:48,195 --> 02:26:49,805
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2096
02:26:49,829 --> 02:26:52,376
But those two should
have done a better job!

2097
02:26:52,401 --> 02:26:54,837
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2098
02:26:54,837 --> 02:26:56,948
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2099
02:26:56,973 --> 02:26:59,333
It might be as you say, however—

2100
02:26:59,358 --> 02:27:01,392
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2101
02:27:01,416 --> 02:27:04,520
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2102
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:06,200
Everything is connected!

2103
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:09,933
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2104
02:27:11,554 --> 02:27:16,032
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2105
02:27:16,057 --> 02:27:20,458
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2106
02:27:20,483 --> 02:27:25,141
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2107
02:27:25,172 --> 02:27:32,048
<i>Either one—</i>

2108
02:27:32,873 --> 02:27:33,973
<i>JoJo</i>

2109
02:27:34,997 --> 02:27:36,097
<i>Dio</i>

2110
02:27:36,912 --> 02:27:43,300
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2111
02:27:51,625 --> 02:27:53,711
I turned those two

2112
02:27:53,942 --> 02:27:59,383
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!

2113
02:28:00,229 --> 02:28:05,785
Even history bends before me!

2114
02:28:05,785 --> 02:28:06,985
It can’t be!

2115
02:28:15,429 --> 02:28:17,627
Such grotesque forms!

2116
02:28:17,628 --> 02:28:22,206
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2117
02:28:22,818 --> 02:28:25,042
Don’t you think so?

2118
02:28:26,061 --> 02:28:28,681
Kill them all!

2119
02:28:28,911 --> 02:28:31,149
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2120
02:28:31,181 --> 02:28:32,266
Tarkus!

2121
02:28:32,266 --> 02:28:33,289
Bruford!

2122
02:28:33,798 --> 02:28:37,087
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2123
02:28:37,441 --> 02:28:40,100
Our grudge!

2124
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:42,378
Our pride!

2125
02:28:42,379 --> 02:28:44,261
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2126
02:28:44,586 --> 02:28:45,696
And you, Tarkus!

2127
02:28:46,439 --> 02:28:47,898
The way you feel—

2128
02:28:48,364 --> 02:28:50,564
Your pride, your resentment.

2129
02:28:52,675 --> 02:28:54,448
I can’t even imagine it!

2130
02:28:55,389 --> 02:28:58,580
But I also bear my own burdens!

2131
02:28:58,632 --> 02:29:01,712
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2132
02:29:01,966 --> 02:29:05,216
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2133
02:29:08,748 --> 02:29:11,026
That man’s pride...

2134
02:29:11,027 --> 02:29:13,158
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2135
02:29:13,413 --> 02:29:16,027
My master—I, Bruford,

2136
02:29:16,222 --> 02:29:20,464
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2137
02:29:20,464 --> 02:29:22,599
Alright, go ahead!

2138
02:29:24,940 --> 02:29:26,496
We’ll duel as knights!

2139
02:29:30,142 --> 02:29:31,068
Run away, you two!

2140
02:29:31,069 --> 02:29:31,706
Mr. Joestar!

2141
02:29:31,729 --> 02:29:32,729
Tarkus!

2142
02:29:34,745 --> 02:29:38,015
I won’t let you interfere!

2143
02:29:51,821 --> 02:29:59,236
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2144
02:29:59,503 --> 02:30:06,973
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2145
02:30:09,343 --> 02:30:10,230
Old man!

2146
02:30:10,231 --> 02:30:11,889
Don’t come any closer!

2147
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:18,960
Damn it...

2148
02:30:20,626 --> 02:30:22,226
Fucking hell!

2149
02:30:23,665 --> 02:30:27,760
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2150
02:30:27,792 --> 02:30:31,499
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2151
02:30:31,722 --> 02:30:35,460
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2152
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:39,654
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2153
02:30:39,739 --> 02:30:42,646
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2154
02:30:42,962 --> 02:30:48,052
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2155
02:30:50,137 --> 02:30:51,288
Honourable knight,

2156
02:30:51,836 --> 02:30:53,858
Is revenge your answer?

2157
02:30:54,303 --> 02:30:56,293
Is that what you take pride in?

2158
02:30:57,681 --> 02:31:01,242
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2159
02:31:01,393 --> 02:31:03,460
You can lecture me after you win!

2160
02:31:03,484 --> 02:31:06,603
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2161
02:31:06,603 --> 02:31:10,952
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2162
02:31:10,968 --> 02:31:14,706
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2163
02:31:14,706 --> 02:31:17,635
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

2164
02:31:17,699 --> 02:31:19,926
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2165
02:31:20,005 --> 02:31:21,338
Old man!

2166
02:31:27,057 --> 02:31:29,426
Melt!

2167
02:31:29,692 --> 02:31:32,921
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2168
02:31:33,145 --> 02:31:34,345
Speedwagon...

2169
02:31:35,374 --> 02:31:38,914
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2170
02:31:38,930 --> 02:31:42,915
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2171
02:31:43,412 --> 02:31:46,880
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2172
02:31:46,881 --> 02:31:50,750
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

2173
02:31:50,750 --> 02:31:58,440
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2174
02:31:58,924 --> 02:32:05,463
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2175
02:32:05,575 --> 02:32:06,575
JoJo!

2176
02:32:10,081 --> 02:32:13,137
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2177
02:32:20,619 --> 02:32:24,079
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2178
02:32:24,080 --> 02:32:26,144
Let it somehow be restored!

2179
02:32:26,697 --> 02:32:30,421
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2180
02:32:31,203 --> 02:32:34,590
This pain means nothing to me!

2181
02:32:40,959 --> 02:32:42,608
Why aren’t you moving?

2182
02:32:45,912 --> 02:32:47,112
Just now,

2183
02:32:49,776 --> 02:32:51,296
You said “pain”.

2184
02:32:54,078 --> 02:32:55,328
That means that now,

2185
02:32:56,862 --> 02:32:58,449
You can feel pain!

2186
02:32:59,997 --> 02:33:01,060
Pain?

2187
02:33:04,322 --> 02:33:05,522
That’s why...

2188
02:33:07,558 --> 02:33:09,393
I stopped fighting you.

2189
02:33:12,590 --> 02:33:14,531
That’s why you stopped your sword.

2190
02:33:18,365 --> 02:33:20,237
You are a great knight.

2191
02:33:22,505 --> 02:33:23,805
You are human!

2192
02:33:26,979 --> 02:33:28,296
Pain...

2193
02:33:29,138 --> 02:33:30,914
Is proof of life!

2194
02:33:33,249 --> 02:33:35,898
So this is what it means to be human?

2195
02:33:36,891 --> 02:33:41,375
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

2196
02:33:51,899 --> 02:33:56,207
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

2197
02:33:57,901 --> 02:33:58,901
Bruford...

2198
02:34:01,845 --> 02:34:05,149
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

2199
02:34:07,051 --> 02:34:08,586
Luck!

2200
02:34:09,741 --> 02:34:10,954
And also...

2201
02:34:11,209 --> 02:34:13,423
Pluck!

2202
02:34:20,478 --> 02:34:25,269
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

2203
02:34:26,447 --> 02:34:28,973
Damn you!

2204
02:34:31,594 --> 02:34:36,813
JoJo!

2205
02:34:44,197 --> 02:34:49,293
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

2206
02:34:51,275 --> 02:34:53,297
Just as I thought...

2207
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:55,457
I, Dio, will—

2208
02:34:59,188 --> 02:35:00,188
Hey baby!

2209
02:35:00,694 --> 02:35:04,083
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

2210
02:35:04,170 --> 02:35:05,634
What the...

2211
02:35:05,745 --> 02:35:12,149
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

2212
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:17,955
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

2213
02:35:25,987 --> 02:35:28,606
What an embarrassment of a knight!

2214
02:35:29,265 --> 02:35:32,169
He never got his revenge!

2215
02:35:32,281 --> 02:35:35,256
What did he have to be joyful about!

2216
02:35:35,328 --> 02:35:36,328
JoJo!

2217
02:35:46,351 --> 02:35:47,515
No!

2218
02:35:47,986 --> 02:35:51,430
How could you!

2219
02:35:54,442 --> 02:35:56,192
For victory!

2220
02:35:59,331 --> 02:36:03,166
I take pride in victory!

2221
02:36:03,458 --> 02:36:05,197
Fuck!

2222
02:36:05,198 --> 02:36:06,642
I’ll get you!

2223
02:36:06,643 --> 02:36:08,109
I’ll get you for this!

2224
02:36:09,709 --> 02:36:10,709
JoJo...

2225
02:36:12,648 --> 02:36:13,648
JoJo!

2226
02:36:13,884 --> 02:36:16,027
My final ripple...

2227
02:36:16,755 --> 02:36:18,610
My... dying wish is...

2228
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:24,777
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

2229
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,639
He collapsed.

2230
02:36:53,045 --> 02:36:56,733
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

2231
02:36:58,059 --> 02:37:01,678
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

2232
02:37:08,816 --> 02:37:10,213
Old man!

2233
02:37:12,086 --> 02:37:13,086
Mr. Zeppeli!

2234
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:15,036
If we lose you—

2235
02:37:15,037 --> 02:37:16,989
There’s no time to be sad.

2236
02:37:17,147 --> 02:37:19,609
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

2237
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:21,044
Old man!

2238
02:37:21,463 --> 02:37:22,463
I...

2239
02:37:23,256 --> 02:37:26,182
I lived my own life to the fullest.

2240
02:37:27,034 --> 02:37:28,518
In the end,

2241
02:37:29,193 --> 02:37:32,189
I leave everything I have to you.

2242
02:37:33,558 --> 02:37:34,558
JoJo,

2243
02:37:34,923 --> 02:37:37,327
You are my hope.

2244
02:37:44,444 --> 02:37:54,144
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

2245
02:37:56,044 --> 02:38:02,820
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

2246
02:38:04,391 --> 02:38:06,390
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

2247
02:38:08,347 --> 02:38:18,168
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

2248
02:38:20,137 --> 02:38:26,676
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

2249
02:38:27,185 --> 02:38:30,380
<i>Into my spirit</i>

2250
02:38:33,128 --> 02:38:34,414
It felt like...

2251
02:38:34,414 --> 02:38:37,921
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.

2252
02:38:38,427 --> 02:38:40,156
From here on...

2253
02:38:40,736 --> 02:38:42,759
I live within you.

2254
02:38:43,630 --> 02:38:44,782
JoJo.

2255
02:38:48,627 --> 02:38:53,768
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2256
02:38:54,491 --> 02:39:00,010
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

2257
02:39:00,732 --> 02:39:05,983
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

2258
02:39:06,578 --> 02:39:09,553
<i>Even this pain...</i>

2259
02:39:12,513 --> 02:39:15,714
<i>Even this pain</i>

2260
02:39:18,481 --> 02:39:28,572
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

2261
02:39:30,425 --> 02:39:40,484
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

2262
02:39:41,311 --> 02:39:52,495
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

2263
02:39:53,573 --> 02:39:57,954
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

2264
02:39:58,965 --> 02:40:02,539
<i>And from this prison...</i>

2265
02:40:05,051 --> 02:40:07,519
<i>I see the stars</i>

2266
02:40:07,956 --> 02:40:13,783
<i>A golden spirit</i>

2267
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:19,730
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

2268
02:40:20,338 --> 02:40:25,594
<i>Will light up</i>

2269
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:30,100
<i>The way to you...</i>

2270
02:40:31,052 --> 02:40:31,986
Dio!

2271
02:40:32,034 --> 02:40:37,207
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

2272
02:41:06,152 --> 02:41:07,983
JoJo...!

2273
02:41:16,523 --> 02:41:19,916
<i>Dio...</i>

2274
02:41:20,584 --> 02:41:24,020
<i>Dio...</i>

2275
02:41:24,772 --> 02:41:28,697
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

2276
02:41:28,976 --> 02:41:32,956
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

2277
02:41:32,981 --> 02:41:36,933
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

2278
02:41:33,334 --> 02:41:36,968
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2279
02:41:37,408 --> 02:41:40,927
<i>I already killed my past</i>

2280
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:40,970
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2281
02:41:40,952 --> 02:41:45,183
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

2282
02:41:45,287 --> 02:41:49,847
<i>You and I are different</i>

2283
02:41:50,050 --> 02:41:53,915
<i>We’re not so different, you’re my son</i>

2284
02:41:53,916 --> 02:41:57,955
<i>I have changed into something new</i>

2285
02:41:57,978 --> 02:42:02,178
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

2286
02:42:02,252 --> 02:42:04,258
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

2287
02:42:04,258 --> 02:42:06,393
<i>DIO: I’ll steal it all
DARIO: You’ll steal it all</i>

2288
02:42:06,394 --> 02:42:10,660
<i>DIO: Upend righteousness</i>

2289
02:42:08,518 --> 02:42:12,068
<i>DARIO: You’re my clever boy!</i>

2290
02:42:10,683 --> 02:42:14,800
<i>DIO: I will conquer it all</i>

2291
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:17,173
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

2292
02:42:15,873 --> 02:42:19,346
<i>DIO: I will dominate everything</i>

2293
02:42:19,347 --> 02:42:24,211
<i>Go ahead and dominate,
what will you want after that?</i>

2294
02:42:24,235 --> 02:42:28,702
<i>What do I want?</i>

2295
02:42:26,808 --> 02:42:31,321
<i>DARIO: What do you want?</i>

2296
02:42:28,702 --> 02:42:31,273
<i>DIO: What do I want?</i>

2297
02:42:31,337 --> 02:42:32,978
<i>I want...</i>

2298
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:37,060
<i>I want...</i>

2299
02:42:34,277 --> 02:42:43,033
{\an8}<i>Dio... Dio...</i>

2300
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:44,441
<i>I want...</i>

2301
02:42:50,452 --> 02:42:51,881
So you’ve come...

2302
02:42:53,968 --> 02:42:58,253
JoJo.

2303
02:42:58,847 --> 02:43:00,126
Is this...

2304
02:43:03,632 --> 02:43:05,657
The world you wished for?

2305
02:43:09,223 --> 02:43:10,223
What?

2306
02:43:14,308 --> 02:43:15,308
The world...

2307
02:43:18,919 --> 02:43:21,677
That you’ve been trying
to obtain for so long...

2308
02:43:26,495 --> 02:43:28,394
Surrounded by death...

2309
02:43:29,971 --> 02:43:31,352
It’s a pitiful world, isn’t it?

2310
02:43:35,582 --> 02:43:38,822
It’s a splendid world where
I’ve dominated everything.

2311
02:43:39,268 --> 02:43:42,553
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

2312
02:43:42,578 --> 02:43:45,590
For that reason, you stole
from uninvolved innocents?

2313
02:43:49,391 --> 02:43:54,089
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

2314
02:43:57,310 --> 02:43:58,572
You’re just afraid.

2315
02:44:01,287 --> 02:44:02,334
Of being human...

2316
02:44:06,572 --> 02:44:08,313
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

2317
02:44:12,833 --> 02:44:14,341
For the sake of obtaining this world...

2318
02:44:15,691 --> 02:44:17,340
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

2319
02:44:17,372 --> 02:44:18,592
You ran away from it.

2320
02:44:29,314 --> 02:44:31,446
The ends justify the means.

2321
02:44:34,386 --> 02:44:35,891
I will win,

2322
02:44:37,743 --> 02:44:40,985
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

2323
02:44:42,519 --> 02:44:45,181
All of this is fate!

2324
02:44:45,206 --> 02:44:46,356
No!

2325
02:44:47,773 --> 02:44:49,683
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

2326
02:44:51,366 --> 02:44:52,714
Opposing fate...

2327
02:44:54,532 --> 02:44:56,230
What will your legacy be?

2328
02:44:59,715 --> 02:45:01,650
Such righteousness!

2329
02:45:09,532 --> 02:45:13,117
Just like the one who gave me this power...

2330
02:45:14,817 --> 02:45:16,675
And then died!

2331
02:45:21,026 --> 02:45:22,645
Just like...

2332
02:45:24,677 --> 02:45:28,832
Your father.

2333
02:45:32,724 --> 02:45:35,072
That’s right.

2334
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:45,914
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

2335
02:45:49,092 --> 02:45:50,953
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

2336
02:45:54,409 --> 02:45:55,897
For the sake of revenge...

2337
02:45:57,663 --> 02:45:58,663
Dio...

2338
02:46:01,091 --> 02:46:02,793
I will kill you!

2339
02:46:03,009 --> 02:46:06,925
We’re one and the same; you want
to exact your revenge! I admire that!

2340
02:46:06,950 --> 02:46:09,254
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

2341
02:46:09,278 --> 02:46:11,122
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

2342
02:46:11,146 --> 02:46:11,849
Speedwagon!

2343
02:46:11,874 --> 02:46:12,587
Right!

2344
02:46:15,627 --> 02:46:21,858
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

2345
02:46:21,913 --> 02:46:24,946
<i>I’ll suck you dry</i>

2346
02:46:24,947 --> 02:46:27,427
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

2347
02:46:28,308 --> 02:46:34,360
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

2348
02:46:34,589 --> 02:46:40,333
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

2349
02:46:41,182 --> 02:46:42,933
<i>Useless, useless, useless, useless!</i>

2350
02:46:44,102 --> 02:46:47,013
<i>I obtained this power</i>

2351
02:46:47,245 --> 02:46:50,344
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

2352
02:46:50,389 --> 02:46:53,558
<i>So I could steal everything from you</i>

2353
02:46:53,598 --> 02:46:56,598
<i>I’ll dull this pain</i>

2354
02:46:56,728 --> 02:46:59,717
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

2355
02:46:59,758 --> 02:47:02,938
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

2356
02:47:02,978 --> 02:47:07,666
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

2357
02:47:07,690 --> 02:47:10,025
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

2358
02:47:14,053 --> 02:47:16,005
<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

2359
02:47:16,617 --> 02:47:18,164
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

2360
02:47:18,315 --> 02:47:20,587
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

2361
02:47:20,588 --> 02:47:23,608
You did it! You defeated Dio!

2362
02:47:23,631 --> 02:47:24,957
Not a chance!

2363
02:47:25,250 --> 02:47:26,781
You fools!

2364
02:47:28,282 --> 02:47:29,837
What! The sword is freezing—

2365
02:47:31,860 --> 02:47:34,961
Utterly pathetic!

2366
02:47:34,961 --> 02:47:36,197
Mr. Joestar!

2367
02:47:36,495 --> 02:47:38,292
JoJo!

2368
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:46,812
<i>Utterly pathetic! I’m grasping
your carotid artery, JoJo!</i>

2369
02:47:47,013 --> 02:47:53,013
<i>With this, you’ll become
one of my undead servants</i>

2370
02:47:53,417 --> 02:47:55,149
<i>Ironic, isn’t it, Dio?</i>

2371
02:47:55,174 --> 02:47:59,679
<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

2372
02:47:59,797 --> 02:48:05,013
<i>Why don’t you freeze me now, Dio!</i>

2373
02:48:05,924 --> 02:48:07,821
My fist... Just from hitting him!

2374
02:48:07,856 --> 02:48:11,116
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

2375
02:48:12,457 --> 02:48:15,613
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

2376
02:48:15,637 --> 02:48:18,761
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

2377
02:48:18,829 --> 02:48:21,669
<i>DIO: Let’s test your willpower
JOJO: I will reach you!</i>

2378
02:48:21,693 --> 02:48:24,893
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

2379
02:48:24,918 --> 02:48:28,114
<i>JOJO: Us humans...
DIO: To be human is to have limits</i>

2380
02:48:28,138 --> 02:48:31,430
<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

2381
02:48:31,455 --> 02:48:34,414
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2382
02:48:34,438 --> 02:48:40,538
<i>DIO: I’ll chip away at this body to prove it
JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

2383
02:48:42,276 --> 02:48:44,120
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

2384
02:48:44,145 --> 02:48:47,152
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2385
02:48:47,176 --> 02:48:50,216
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

2386
02:48:50,426 --> 02:48:53,454
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2387
02:48:53,478 --> 02:48:56,720
<i>JOJO: Our connection, it’s here
DIO: Even when I’ve thrown away my humanity</i>

2388
02:48:56,753 --> 02:48:59,660
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2389
02:48:59,707 --> 02:49:03,429
<i>With my life on the
line, I’ll prove it now!</i>

2390
02:49:03,453 --> 02:49:07,634
<i>-Dio! Dio! Dio!
-JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

2391
02:49:10,819 --> 02:49:12,913
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

2392
02:49:13,311 --> 02:49:15,294
“I like being number one!”

2393
02:49:18,233 --> 02:49:19,272
“My eye!”

2394
02:49:19,304 --> 02:49:21,553
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

2395
02:49:25,734 --> 02:49:26,734
Dio!

2396
02:49:28,289 --> 02:49:35,713
<i>I won’t stop beating you
until you’re finished!</i>

2397
02:49:42,758 --> 02:49:43,913
This is impossible!

2398
02:49:44,457 --> 02:49:46,690
The heat is coursing through me!

2399
02:49:47,163 --> 02:49:48,414
I’m melting!

2400
02:49:48,438 --> 02:49:49,723
Crumble to dust!

2401
02:49:49,747 --> 02:49:51,961
I can’t be...

2402
02:49:52,961 --> 02:49:55,024
Not yet!!

2403
02:49:58,041 --> 02:50:02,254
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

2404
02:50:02,279 --> 02:50:05,854
Lord Dio...!

2405
02:50:14,895 --> 02:50:15,895
Dio...!

2406

<i>(Now, on to other news...)</i>

2432
02:51:51,857 --> 02:51:53,762
Mr. Joestar! Both of you!

2433
02:51:53,762 --> 02:51:55,301
Best of wishes!

2434
02:51:55,528 --> 02:51:57,487
I’ll always be there for you!

2435
02:51:57,520 --> 02:52:01,124
If you’re in trouble, I’ll rush anywhere!

2436
02:52:01,171 --> 02:52:03,328
Happy honeymoon!

2437
02:52:03,328 --> 02:52:06,176
I can’t wait to hear all about it!

2438
02:52:06,785 --> 02:52:08,785
America, how nice!

2439
02:52:09,110 --> 02:52:11,324
I wanna go there too,

2440
02:52:11,325 --> 02:52:13,922
And try to dig up some oil for myself!

2441
02:52:14,354 --> 02:52:15,878
Damn it...

2442
02:52:17,026 --> 02:52:20,709
But after this, a fateful
moment was soon to come...

2443
02:52:21,169 --> 02:52:25,359
This story will be passed down
until the world has come full circle.

2444
02:52:25,360 --> 02:52:30,154
That will be the life’s work
of Speedwagon the meddler...

2445
02:52:30,463 --> 02:52:34,991
But, the one to tell you what
happens right now won’t be me...

2446
02:52:43,327 --> 02:52:48,137
<i>I pray that today will never end</i>

2447
02:52:48,137 --> 02:52:51,240
<i>In the midst of a carousel of stars</i>

2448
02:52:51,741 --> 02:53:00,116
<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>

2449
02:53:00,414 --> 02:53:01,716
What’s wrong?

2450
02:53:04,970 --> 02:53:06,923
When you’re next to me...

2451
02:53:07,702 --> 02:53:09,119
I’m happy!

2452
02:53:09,508 --> 02:53:11,143
I feel the same.

2453
02:53:11,508 --> 02:53:13,603
I wish you could’ve met my father...

2454
02:53:14,389 --> 02:53:16,198
Well, let’s go and eat!

2455
02:53:21,101 --> 02:53:22,101
Jonathan?

2456
02:53:22,927 --> 02:53:23,927
That’s...

2457
02:53:27,869 --> 02:53:28,869
Erina,

2458
02:53:29,901 --> 02:53:31,338
Go back to our cabin.

2459
02:53:32,036 --> 02:53:33,983
Don’t forget to lock the door!

2460
02:53:44,455 --> 02:53:46,562
I have lured him here.

2461
02:53:47,201 --> 02:53:48,897
My body...

2462
02:53:50,273 --> 02:53:51,767
Have you come?

2463
02:53:53,074 --> 02:53:54,074
Dio...

2464
02:53:54,576 --> 02:53:55,576
JoJo...

2465
02:53:57,431 --> 02:54:01,778
I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

2466
02:54:03,399 --> 02:54:05,783
I used to despise you so much,

2467
02:54:06,022 --> 02:54:08,419
But now I respect you...

2468
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,989
That’s because I’ve realised something!

2469
02:54:13,436 --> 02:54:16,692
If there is a God that controls fate,

2470
02:54:17,546 --> 02:54:21,330
Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

2471
02:54:22,788 --> 02:54:26,369
You’re the reason I got this power,

2472
02:54:27,184 --> 02:54:29,572
And you’re the reason why...

2473
02:54:30,413 --> 02:54:33,542
The world has slipped from my grasp!

2474
02:54:34,474 --> 02:54:35,811
When will it...

2475
02:54:36,879 --> 02:54:37,837
Be enough for you?

2476
02:54:37,837 --> 02:54:40,449
That’s exactly what our destiny is!

2477
02:54:41,837 --> 02:54:47,356
I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.

2478
02:54:47,999 --> 02:54:51,327
And live in eternal glory!

2479
02:54:52,678 --> 02:54:54,416
JoJo...

2480
02:54:55,527 --> 02:54:57,535
You and I...

2481
02:54:58,289 --> 02:55:01,305
Are one and the same in this world!

2482
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:07,383
Lord Dio! Look, look, look!

2483
02:55:07,384 --> 02:55:09,542
Please look!

2484
02:55:10,153 --> 02:55:11,566
Jonathan!

2485
02:55:13,519 --> 02:55:15,850
<i>From light to darkness</i>

2486
02:55:15,858 --> 02:55:17,961
<i>This is the start of my mythos</i>

2487
02:55:17,962 --> 02:55:20,123
<i>I will end it all</i>

2488
02:55:20,124 --> 02:55:22,148
<i>And restart it all</i>

2489
02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:24,820
<i>For this is Dio’s World!</i>

2490
02:55:24,821 --> 02:55:26,376
Right, Erina Joestar?

2491
02:55:26,377 --> 02:55:27,210
Dio!

2492
02:55:27,232 --> 02:55:30,986
<i>I can’t speak—can’t breathe—</i>

2493
02:55:31,478 --> 02:55:33,035
<i>My ripple!</i>

2494
02:55:33,272 --> 02:55:35,296
Erina! Not you too!

2495
02:55:35,948 --> 02:55:39,305
<i>This is the start of his mythos!</i>

2496
02:55:39,313 --> 02:55:44,947
<i>This ark is swarming with his followers!</i>

2497
02:55:46,790 --> 02:55:47,988
Please, spare the child!

2498
02:55:48,726 --> 02:55:49,726
Run!

2499
02:55:49,933 --> 02:55:51,473
Shall we torture him to death?!

2500
02:55:51,474 --> 02:55:54,395
Or maybe enjoy watching him asphyxiate?!

2501
02:55:54,401 --> 02:55:55,489
Wang Chan!

2502
02:55:56,621 --> 02:56:00,803
<i>Painlessly cut his head
from his shoulders!</i>

2503
02:56:00,804 --> 02:56:03,098
<i>I won’t tolerate any insults!</i>

2504
02:56:03,099 --> 02:56:05,358
<i>My friend, Jonathan Joestar—</i>

2505
02:56:05,778 --> 02:56:08,990
<i>I’ll take you as my own</i>

2506
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:14,486
<i>Your blood will become my future!</i>

2507
02:56:14,549 --> 02:56:17,947
<i>I’ll tie our futures together</i>

2508
02:56:18,602 --> 02:56:22,832
<i>With my final ripple!</i>

2509
02:56:22,888 --> 02:56:26,722
<i>JoJo!</i>

2510
02:56:26,977 --> 02:56:31,750
<i>JoJo!</i>

2511
02:56:42,052 --> 02:56:48,051
<i>I felt it tear. Something
important inside me just tore</i>

2512
02:56:48,135 --> 02:56:49,135
Jonathan!

2513
02:56:51,257 --> 02:56:53,247
ERINA: How could this be?!
JOJO: Get out of here!

2514
02:56:53,952 --> 02:56:55,951
I won’t, JoJo...

2515
02:56:56,658 --> 02:57:04,960
<i>I will burn with you</i>

2516
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:13,135
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

2517
02:57:17,595 --> 02:57:19,857
<i>(The flash of flames)</i>

2518
02:57:19,905 --> 02:57:21,835
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2519
02:57:21,841 --> 02:57:23,912
<i>You can’t ask me to live!</i>

2520
02:57:23,913 --> 02:57:25,969
<i>There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

2521
02:57:25,976 --> 02:57:28,545
<i>JOJO: It’s alright if you cry
ERINA: Your courage is too cruel!</i>

2522
02:57:28,545 --> 02:57:30,376
<i>JOJO: You will be
ERINA: I will be</i>

2523
02:57:30,377 --> 02:57:34,046
<i>The one to spin the thread of fate</i>

2524
02:57:34,081 --> 02:57:38,017
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2525
02:57:34,401 --> 02:57:41,096
<i>Just like my mother
died for me, I’ll—</i>

2526
02:57:38,104 --> 02:57:42,318
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2527
02:57:42,342 --> 02:57:46,001
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2528
02:57:42,684 --> 02:57:44,570
<i>Farewell!</i>

2529
02:57:44,570 --> 02:57:46,297
<i>I’m still alive! </i>

2530
02:57:46,530 --> 02:57:52,207
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

2531
02:57:46,555 --> 02:57:50,253
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2532
02:57:52,439 --> 02:57:57,257
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

2533
02:57:57,257 --> 02:58:00,209
<i>JoJo!</i>

2534
02:58:06,732 --> 02:58:08,691
I know what you’re like...

2535
02:58:10,493 --> 02:58:11,824
I figured...

2536
02:58:12,777 --> 02:58:14,253
You would strike...

2537
02:58:15,475 --> 02:58:16,917
Before I...

2538
02:58:20,132 --> 02:58:21,532
Lost consciousness.

2539
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:25,060
JoJo?

2540
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:27,488
Let me go, JoJo!

2541
02:58:31,337 --> 02:58:32,337
He’s...

2542
02:58:36,696 --> 02:58:37,696
Dead...

2543
02:58:59,799 --> 02:59:04,480
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

2544
02:59:14,181 --> 02:59:19,628
<i>That proud life of his</i>

2545
02:59:20,213 --> 02:59:24,266
<i>Vanished into the dusts of time</i>

2546
02:59:24,881 --> 02:59:29,101
<i>But this fateful adventure</i>

2547
02:59:29,744 --> 02:59:34,309
<i>Will become an inheritance</i>

2548
02:59:34,356 --> 02:59:37,165
<i>Passed down forever</i>

2549
02:59:39,502 --> 02:59:41,756
<i>His golden spirit</i>

02:59:41,778 --> 02:59:45,954
<i>(Phantom Blood)</i>

2551
02:59:51,678 --> 02:59:54,363
<i>Like two who make one,</i>

2552
02:59:54,883 --> 02:59:58,740
<i>We feel a bizarre friendship</i>

2553
02:59:59,899 --> 03:00:02,838
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

2554
03:00:03,739 --> 03:00:06,731
<i>If it weren’t for you...</i>

2555
03:00:06,731 --> 03:00:09,310
<i>No, it’s because of you</i>

2556
03:00:09,311 --> 03:00:11,580
<i>Hey, JoJo</i>

2557
03:00:12,153 --> 03:00:14,850
<i>Now I’ll...</i>

2558
03:00:15,706 --> 03:00:19,988
<i>Keep looking at the stars</i>

2559
03:00:20,119 --> 03:00:26,661
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2560
03:00:27,412 --> 03:00:31,700
<i>We’ll reach out to the stars</i>

2561
03:00:31,833 --> 03:00:38,107
<i>Our two fates</i>

2562
03:00:38,413 --> 03:00:41,903
<i>Have become one</i>

2563

{\an8}<i>(That immortal poem echoes quietly)</i>

2564
03:00:44,474 --> 03:00:47,371
<i>Until the world</i>

{\an8}<i>(One saw stars)</i>

2566
03:00:49,679 --> 03:00:53,377
<i>Is born anew</i>

03:00:50,576 --> 03:00:53,505
{\an8}<i>(The stars are shimmering)</i>

2568

{\an8}<i>(Like blood through a vein,
mud is pulsating)</i>

2569
03:00:55,407 --> 03:00:58,727
<i>I’ll live</i>

03:00:56,216 --> 03:01:00,562
{\an8}<i>(One saw mud)</i>

2571
03:00:59,351 --> 03:01:02,064
<i>I’ll disappear</i>

2572
03:01:02,155 --> 03:01:12,849
<i>JOJO: With you!
DIO: I will live!</i>

2573
03:01:03,425 --> 03:01:08,830
{\an8}<i>(The sunlight yellow gleam shines)</i>

2574
03:01:08,830 --> 03:01:12,987
{\an8}<i>(Let the golden wind blow)</i>

2575
03:01:12,986 --> 03:01:18,505
{\an8}<i>(And the shadow of midnight
blue darkness grows)</i>

<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

03:01:25,494 --> 03:01:28,518
<i>(The tale will keep on being told)</i>

2580
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:34,692

03:01:35,539 --> 03:01:44,573
<i>(Our golden spirit will shine)</i>

2582
03:01:50,019 --> 03:01:53,615
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

2583
03:06:28,875 --> 03:06:32,833
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.

2584
03:06:36,974 --> 03:06:38,685
This is a public [streamed] performance.

2585
03:06:38,911 --> 03:06:43,726
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,

2586
03:06:43,751 --> 03:06:47,296
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.

2587
03:06:50,032 --> 03:06:51,581
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.

2588
03:06:51,606 --> 03:06:55,893
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.

2589
03:06:55,933 --> 03:06:57,933
Thank you for today.

2590
03:07:01,064 --> 03:07:03,313
The musical will close tomorrow, though.

2591
03:07:03,587 --> 03:07:06,913
This type of role has been
played by others before,

2592
03:07:07,453 --> 03:07:11,233
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.

2593
03:07:11,497 --> 03:07:16,084
There have been many
things that led to this day.

2594
03:07:16,084 --> 03:07:22,153
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...

2595
03:07:22,394 --> 03:07:27,589
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...

2596
03:07:28,013 --> 03:07:33,450
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.

2597
03:07:33,608 --> 03:07:36,192
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

2598
03:07:36,217 --> 03:07:39,854
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—

2599
03:07:39,879 --> 03:07:43,433
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.

2600
03:07:43,458 --> 03:07:45,814
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.

2601
03:07:45,839 --> 03:07:50,552
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.

2602
03:07:50,577 --> 03:07:53,073
From the bottom of my heart,

2603
03:07:53,098 --> 03:07:54,695
Pow.

2604
03:07:54,719 --> 03:07:56,719
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!

2605
03:08:08,767 --> 03:08:12,804
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.

2606
03:08:12,828 --> 03:08:14,828
Thank you for today!

2607
03:08:16,180 --> 03:08:18,609
Did you have fun, everyone?!

2608
03:08:19,756 --> 03:08:22,557
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.

2609
03:08:22,977 --> 03:08:26,972
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.

2610
03:08:26,997 --> 03:08:29,015
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.

2611
03:08:29,016 --> 03:08:32,066
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.

2612
03:08:32,067 --> 03:08:34,485
I—are you worried?

2613
03:08:34,507 --> 03:08:35,335
Nah, it’s probably okay.

2614
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:36,946
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!

2615
03:08:35,917 --> 03:08:37,899
-He’s—that’s in the past.

2616
03:08:37,923 --> 03:08:41,368
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.

2617
03:08:41,393 --> 03:08:45,543
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.

2618
03:08:45,568 --> 03:08:49,436
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,

2619
03:08:49,461 --> 03:08:52,656
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.

2620
03:08:52,681 --> 03:08:54,374
And I’m relieved that we made it.

2621
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:57,973
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!

2622
03:09:02,638 --> 03:09:07,211
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

2623
03:09:07,236 --> 03:09:09,310
But when we made it to opening day,

2624
03:09:09,335 --> 03:09:15,774
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,

2625
03:09:15,799 --> 03:09:17,300
Which has continued up through today.

2626
03:09:17,325 --> 03:09:22,257
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.

2627
03:09:22,282 --> 03:09:29,444
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.

2628
03:09:29,469 --> 03:09:32,671
For having supported us up to this point.

2629
03:09:32,696 --> 03:09:34,838
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.

2630
03:09:34,863 --> 03:09:39,394
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

2631
03:09:39,419 --> 03:09:40,953
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.

2632
03:09:41,165 --> 03:09:44,162
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.

2633
03:09:44,187 --> 03:09:46,088
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!

2634
03:09:46,113 --> 03:09:47,573
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.

2635
03:09:47,598 --> 03:09:48,568
Excuse yourself...

2636
03:09:48,593 --> 03:09:51,330
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.

2637
03:09:51,355 --> 03:09:55,659
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.

2638
03:09:55,684 --> 03:09:56,759
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.

2639
03:09:56,784 --> 03:10:00,874
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.

2640
03:10:00,875 --> 03:10:04,218
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.

2641
03:10:04,273 --> 03:10:05,668
You were just that wonderful.

2642
03:10:05,692 --> 03:10:07,008
[INAUDIBLE]

2643
03:10:07,032 --> 03:10:09,161
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...

2644
03:10:09,186 --> 03:10:14,519
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—

2645
03:10:14,544 --> 03:10:23,520
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.

2646
03:10:23,545 --> 03:10:30,154
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.

2647
03:10:30,293 --> 03:10:34,488
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

2648
03:10:34,513 --> 03:10:38,570
Thank you everyone in the cast!

2649
03:10:38,754 --> 03:10:42,632
It was wonderful. Thanks!

2650
03:10:47,447 --> 03:10:52,128
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

2651
03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:53,656
Now to everyone at the theatre,

2652
03:10:53,681 --> 03:10:58,262
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

2653
03:10:58,287 --> 03:11:00,811
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

2654
03:11:03,306 --> 03:11:04,012
Thanks!

2655
03:11:08,401 --> 03:11:11,584
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.

2656
03:11:11,654 --> 03:11:17,469
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!

2657
03:11:17,494 --> 03:11:19,700
Everyone, do your best!

2658
03:11:19,725 --> 03:11:21,725
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!

2659
03:11:23,435 --> 03:11:26,608
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?

2660
03:11:26,633 --> 03:11:29,990
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!

2661
03:11:30,105 --> 03:11:32,512
I’m gonna watch it too!

2662
03:11:34,081 --> 03:11:36,413
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

2663
03:11:36,845 --> 03:11:37,736
Pardon me.

2664
03:11:37,761 --> 03:11:44,570
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!

2665
03:11:52,838 --> 03:11:56,769
Truly, thank you for today!

2666

tomorrow’s performance too!

2672

Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

2673
