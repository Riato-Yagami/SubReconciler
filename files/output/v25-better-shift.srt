Something wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread)}

291
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Ah, nothing.
{\ O (spread)}

292
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.
{\ O (rank)}

Mister Brando!
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: Hehehehe.}

298
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I’m Police Inspector Archer!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Brand, this is Inspector Archer.}

299
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,760
Police? Has something happened?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Police? Did something happen?}

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,105
Oh, no!
{\ O (spread)}

301
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,450
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.
{\ O (spread)}

302
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,795
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...
{\ O (spread)}

Ah, that was—
{\ O (spread)}

-He came at me so suddenly.
{\ O (spread)}

305
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,830
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (spread)}

306
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,175
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (spread)}

307
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but

Yes, sir.
{\ O (rank)}

{\ O (spread)}

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell

Watch it!
{\ O (spread)}

I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!
{\ O (spread)}

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I just try to be friendly}

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: What are you both doing?}

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: One more thing}

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I hate dogs}

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:10,919
The way they grovel and suck

Keep your stupid dog away from me!

Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:46,120
It’s just because I love reading so much!

But they haven’t even

<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

{\ O (spread)}

But...
{\ O (spread)}

371
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:02,648
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: There are two knights in English folklore.}

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (spread)}

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here is my question for you:
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: Here's the problem for both of you}

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: yes}

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,666
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?
{\ O (spread)}

383
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,333
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread)}

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Or is it the star shining above?}

385
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Which do you think?}

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,666
The stars?
{\ O (spread)}

387
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,333
Or the mud?
{\ O (spread)}

388
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,000
I...
{\ O (spread)}

389
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,666
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

390
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,333
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread)}

391
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they have no choice but to die for their master.}

392
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread)}

393
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread)}

394
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I think I was looking at the stars}

They held onto their honour!
{\ O (spread)}

The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!
{\ O (spread)}

00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,600
So what!
{\ O (spread)}

398
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
So what?
{\ O (spread)}

399
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

400
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,500
But they—
{\ O (spread)}

401
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

402
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,000
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread)}

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Such regret...
{\ O (spread)}

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:26:48,999
I think...
{\ O (spread)}

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: That soul-dissolving powerlessness}

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: All they saw was mud.}

407
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,285
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (spread)}

408
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,571
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread)}

409
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,857
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (spread)}

410
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,142
Listen!
{\ O (spread)}

00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,428
You’re a noble! You have it all!
{\ O (spread)}

412
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:31,714
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread)}

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: So, in order to fulfill that responsibility, shouldn't we think about what we can accomplish with our lives?}

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I}

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,500
That’s enough, you two.

There’s no right answer to this question.
{\ O (rank)}

Mine and Dio’s!
{\ O (spread)}

1678
01:58:57,150 --> 01:59:00,197
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,
{\ O (spread)}

1679
01:59:00,197 --> 01:59:03,244
That turns humans into vampires.
{\ O (spread)}

Beings who must get energy

Not the same as Dio’s!

“The north wind created the brave vikings!”
{\ O (spread)}

You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

They come after us humans

Could you call something

What are you yammering on about!

So then, what exactly is “courage”?
{\ O (spread)}

1879
02:14:17,562 --> 02:14:20,833
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!
{\ O (spread)}

1880

Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

The ripple breathing technique

But in the moment they

I’ll give you a little souvenir

Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

But those two should

In the end, they couldn’t do

02:28:35,733 --> 02:28:40,168
The only thing to call

It might be as you say, however—
{\ O (spread)}

There is nothing that is without meaning.
{\ O (spread)}

The same can be said about the

Everything is connected!

This is a public [streamed] performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2579
03:04:20,483 --> 03:04:37,324
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread)}

2580
03:04:37,324 --> 03:04:54,166
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread)}

2581
03:04:54,166 --> 03:05:11,008
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.
{\ O (spread)}

2582
03:05:11,008 --> 03:05:27,849
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.
{\ O (spread)}

2583
03:05:27,849 --> 03:05:44,691
Thank you for today.
{\ O (spread)}

2584
03:05:44,691 --> 03:06:01,533
The musical will close tomorrow, though.
{\ O (spread)}

2585
03:06:01,533 --> 03:06:18,375
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread)}

2586
03:06:18,375 --> 03:06:35,216
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.
{\ O (spread)}

2587
03:06:35,216 --> 03:06:52,058
There have been many
things that led to this day.
{\ O (spread)}

2588
03:06:52,058 --> 03:07:08,900
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...
{\ O (spread)}

2589
03:07:08,900 --> 03:07:25,741
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...
{\ O (spread)}

2590
03:07:25,741 --> 03:07:42,583
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.
{\ O (spread)}

2591
03:07:42,583 --> 03:07:59,425
And foremost, the people
who came every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2592
03:07:59,425 --> 03:08:16,266
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2593
03:08:16,266 --> 03:08:33,108
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.
{\ O (spread)}

2594
03:08:33,108 --> 03:08:49,950
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.
{\ O (spread)}

2595
03:08:49,950 --> 03:09:06,791
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.
{\ O (spread)}

2596
03:09:06,791 --> 03:09:23,633

{\ O (spread)}

03:09:23,633 --> 03:09:40,475
Pow.

2598
03:09:40,475 --> 03:09:57,316

{\ O (spread)}

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: thank you.}

2601
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,833
Did you have fun, everyone?!
{\ O (spread)}

2602
03:10:35,833 --> 03:10:38,666
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.
{\ O (spread)}

2603
03:10:38,666 --> 03:10:41,500
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2604
03:10:41,500 --> 03:10:44,333
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.
{\ O (spread)}

2605
03:10:44,333 --> 03:10:47,166
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.
{\ O (spread)}

2606
03:10:47,166 --> 03:10:50,000
I—are you worried?
{\ O (spread)}

2607
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,833
Nah, it’s probably okay.
{\ O (spread)}

2608
03:10:52,833 --> 03:10:55,666
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!
{\ O (spread)}

2609
03:10:55,666 --> 03:10:58,500
-He’s—that’s in the past.
{\ O (spread)}

2610
03:10:58,500 --> 03:11:01,333
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.
{\ O (spread)}

2611
03:11:01,333 --> 03:11:04,166
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.
{\ O (spread)}

2612
03:11:04,166 --> 03:11:07,000
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,
{\ O (spread)}

2613
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,833
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2614
03:11:09,833 --> 03:11:12,666
And I’m relieved that we made it.
{\ O (spread)}

2615
03:11:12,666 --> 03:11:15,500
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!
{\ O (spread)}

2616
03:11:15,500 --> 03:11:18,333
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2617
03:11:18,333 --> 03:11:21,166
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2618
03:11:21,166 --> 03:11:24,000
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2619
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,833
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2620
03:11:26,833 --> 03:11:29,666
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.
{\ O (spread)}

2621
03:11:29,666 --> 03:11:32,500
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.
{\ O (spread)}

2622
03:11:32,500 --> 03:11:35,333
For having supported us up to this point.
{\ O (spread)}

2623
03:11:35,333 --> 03:11:38,166
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:11:38,166 --> 03:11:41,000
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:43,833
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:11:43,833 --> 03:11:46,666
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:11:46,666 --> 03:11:49,500
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!
{\ O (spread)}

2628
03:11:49,500 --> 03:11:52,333
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.
{\ O (spread)}

2629
03:11:52,333 --> 03:11:55,166
Excuse yourself...
{\ O (spread)}

2630
03:11:55,166 --> 03:11:58,000
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.
{\ O (spread)}

2631
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,833
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.
{\ O (spread)}

2632
03:12:00,833 --> 03:12:03,666
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.
{\ O (spread)}

2633
03:12:03,666 --> 03:12:06,500
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2634
03:12:06,500 --> 03:12:09,333
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread)}

2635
03:12:09,333 --> 03:12:12,166
You were just that wonderful.

{\ O (spread)}

2638
03:12:17,833 --> 03:12:20,666
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—
{\ O (spread)}

2639
03:12:20,666 --> 03:12:23,500
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.
{\ O (spread)}

2640
03:12:23,500 --> 03:12:26,333
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.
{\ O (spread)}

2641
03:12:26,333 --> 03:12:29,166
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.
