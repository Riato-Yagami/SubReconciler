hard

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is also on screen and can be spoken about.

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is this thing on?

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You are watching this.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, it’s good.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You have been chosen.

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I decided it was trustworthy.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why now.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This record must be kept.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If something should
happen to me, I—

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If something should
happen to me, I—

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This Foundation is a sub-structure of humanity,

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Medicine, government studies, high school studies, etc.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's your mood?

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, that's the impression.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That’s how it looks on the outside.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All the things that steal Shiv from the world,

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Right, that’s the cover.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Stone Mask.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The mood is,

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The mood is,

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The mood is,

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The Foundation's purpose in death,

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That is to do the secret of the stone screen.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And today, I am recording this.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A story awaits behind the mask,

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And there it was,

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is so that they can follow the lead.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dear Osamu,

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Dear Osamu,

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Dear Osamu,

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Dear Osamu,

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Blessed man,

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The power of life,

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The power of life,

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The power of life,

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Appearance.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000

<i>The power in this hand</i>

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Widespread

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
This story awaits in the Stone Mask

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,000
The two are the boy's favorite fateful adventure

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,500
1868 Years Old Ronto's son

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Watcher!

63
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,500
It's Ikeame

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I won't leave again

65
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

66
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I'll finish you up, Ikeri

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Today is

68
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
I'm sleepy

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I don't understand the sun

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Who is it?

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Isn't it the birther who is the self?

72
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

73
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It's coming

74
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
The first person will go

75
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
wait a minute

76
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Okay tease

77
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
hang on

78
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Hurry, hurry

79
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Wooooooooooooo!

80
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,940
It's a rich man, it's a fast one, so I'm going to look for him.

84
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I said wait!

85
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,420
It's a beautiful necklace. Thank you.

86
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,640
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

87
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,700
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

88
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,700
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

89
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,600
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

90
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,900
The valuables are gone, Yuriya and I are scared

91
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,900
It's a hole in the hand of a certain person's house. It's a hole in the hand of a certain person's house.

92
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Look, find it

93
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Just one night

94
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,300
No thanks

95
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Brother, do you believe me? What were you doing?

96
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,300
Nice teeth!

97
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,900

99
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,200
Did you buy it?

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,140
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,120
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.

102
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
What about Red?

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,480
Morning

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,380
I helped

105
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,180
Is this also a dream?

106
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,060
Race saved my life

107
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,260
My name is

Used

109
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,320
So this too is fate...

110
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,980
Naroruhodoromonchya, no offense, but Brand!

111
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,780
Ah, Dario, beat Brando!

112
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,140
Time passed, and in 1880

113
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,960
The time was filled with enthusiasm

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,520
Let's talk, it's terrible

115
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm getting on well

116
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,820
People were dreaming

117
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,020
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

118
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,520
Take him in your hands

119
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,620
People were reaching out

<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

121

I don't watch it, but it's out of date

122
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,520
When will ordinary darkness come, I'm waiting

123
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,580
That voice, even

124
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,020
A suspicious voice

125
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,160
Come on, find out who I am

126
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,360
Press the middle button and listen carefully

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680

I'd like to tell you guys too.

134
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,020
To the people, to this country, to Basa, to this era

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
oh!

189
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
What should we do?

190
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
oh!

191
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
I'm not going!

192
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm really going to do it!

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,740
Go!

194
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
nice!

195
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:57,740
C’mon, let’s go!

196
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
This idiot

197
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
oh!

198
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Little puke stain!

199
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,740
Don’t let this brat go!

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,740
What’re you looking at, smart-arse?

201
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,820
Yours is the best

202
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,280
I don't want that to happen!

203
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Masseuse in the front

204
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,200
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

205
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,400
Oh no!

206
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,100
Oh no!

207
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
He croak or somethin’?

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,600
Oh no!

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
He croak or somethin’?

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,300
a

211
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,040
a

212
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
Medicine

213
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,480
The medicine is now

214
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

215
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,880
Oh no

216
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,140
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

217
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,240
I know

218
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Hey

219
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,580
Since I disappeared as a new

220
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,180
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

221
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,500
What is it, Father?

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,740
Nah, I don’t need that.

223
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,500
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

224
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,180
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

225
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,300
It's a rule

226
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
I’m worried that after I die...

227
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,460
I’m worried that after I die...

228
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,260
Okay?

229
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,660
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

230
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,020
Go to that guy

231
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,620
Take this.

232
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,620
Take this.

233
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,140
That's nice

234
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,100
It can be stuck even if you cut it properly.

235
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
“Joestar”?

236
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,340
And he owes me one.

237
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,740
Okay, Dio

238
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,900
And he owes me one.

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,260
Go to him.

240
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,900
Go to him.

241
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Dio

242
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,340
You’re a smart boy.

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,540
You’re a smart boy.

244
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,780
Stolen

245
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,020
Keep going

246
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,540
That's right

247
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,740
Unbeatable

248
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,460
I feel nauseous

249
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,900
It's hell now

250
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,500
Hakie wo Moyoko

251
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,580
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

252
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,900
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

253
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,260
He hugged me

254
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,620
Nedio

255
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,100
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

256
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,220
My mother kept saying that

257
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,820
It was terrible and he died.

258
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,060
openly

259
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,140
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

260
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,140
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

261
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,460
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

262
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,300
Do you have it?

263
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,980
Just like that...

264
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,500
It happened

265
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:08,900
Blowing in my ears

266
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,940
The worst father

267
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,500
Not losing has always been losing

268
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,660
Under this cloudy sky

269
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,940
I was already running and dying

270
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,020
Let's receive Issan now

271
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,580
Use all

272
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:45,140
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

273
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:51,220
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

274
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,380
<i>Now, I’ll go take this “inheritance”</i>

275
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,300
It happened

276
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,140
You have it

277
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:11,620
Boredom in that sky

278
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,300
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

279
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,320
Usually

280
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,420
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

281
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,700
Come on, I already have some good ones

282
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Come on, I heard your family trades in medicine for your wife.

283
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
My father is a proper doctor.

284
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,300
I don't know. But the high stars.

285
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
You’ve got something good today too, eh?

286
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh yeah!

287
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

288
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Oh, do it!

289
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Don't act all high and mighty just because you're in front of my house.

290
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Hey, is anyone doing this?

291
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
It's Jouster Keljouna.

292
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Stop right there!

293
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

294
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,300
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

295
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Ah-ha!

296
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Dear breakfast!

297
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Um, are you okay?

298
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
Leave me alone.

299
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

300
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,300
I didn't do it to be thanked by you.

301
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm aiming for true passion.

302
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
You were a girl and it was a problem.

303
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
So I just stood up.

304
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
I did this because I wanted to.

305
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Okay, let's go!

306
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

307
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Jona-san Jowstar.

308
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Let’s go, Danny!

309
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Hey, Dani!

310
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
You...

311
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,300
You're Diopransola!

312
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,300
That's you, Jona-san Jouster.

313
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Everyone calls her Chocho.

314
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Looking forward to working with you.

315
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
This is my friend Danny.

316
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Let's go.

317
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
It's okay because it won't sag or fall off.

318
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
friend?

319
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

320
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

321
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
Yeah!

322
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I've been waiting for you, Diopland.

323
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Danny! What was that for!

324
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,300
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

325
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
What's wrong, Jojo?

326
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

327
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

328
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Maybe you could live your life like Jojo.

329
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,300
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

330
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
BLADDOG!

331
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
It's the Cape Archer!

332
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
police?

333
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Is something wrong?

334
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,300
The Jowstar movement is a long-standing friendship.

335
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,300
I heard Danny cry just now.

336
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Oh, no!

337
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

338
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

339
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,300
-He came at me so suddenly.

340
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,300
JoJo, I'm already happy with Danny.

341
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

342
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
It's a year like that.

343
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

344
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

345
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
BLADDOG!

346
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
JoJo!

347
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Mister Brando!

348
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
JoJo!

349
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
So, this is my Geass game!

350
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
Don't touch my bag.

351
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I'm driving.

352
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, your hands are sticky like a dog's.

353
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I was just trying to carry it for—

354
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

355
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

356
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

357
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

358
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

359
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
What are you two doing?

360
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,300
What are you two doing?

361
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,300
They are trying to curry favor with humanity and ignore their enemies.

362
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,300
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

363
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
I'll get to work on the jaw now.

364
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Thus, the two proofs met and the two players began.

365
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Hitaka Jojo.

366
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,300
Dioc.

367
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Okay?

368
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,380
I aye raa

369
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:07,660
A little dancing,

370
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Still no good, get it on your hands.

371
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

372
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,660
To prevent us from connecting with each other

373
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

374
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,660
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

375
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Being reborn and illuminating

376
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

377
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

378
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
This is the sixth time

379
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,660
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

380
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
Because I liked reading books

381
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
This much

382
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
It’s just because I love reading so much!

383
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
Ikane

384
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
We are

385
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Here as a high memory

386
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
real

387
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Check it out

388
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,660
That's not enough

389
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Pesh thing

390
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

391
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,660
Don't do horsetail

392
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Nothing is always

393
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Without passing by the beauty

394
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,660
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

395
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

396
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
To be loved

397
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Really high

398
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Azukasa

399
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,660
a little bit

400
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

401
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Do you believe it?

402
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Look at it

403
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

404
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Perfect supporter

405
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Shockley, too.

406
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Aventine

407
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
That's it

408
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Riwo

409
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

410
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
I

411
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Embarrassing

412
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
You

413
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,660
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

414
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Such

415
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

416
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,660
always

417
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
Correct the festival

418
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Ikane

419
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,660
We are

420
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
Were you born?

421
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
As a memory

422
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
Philosophy

423
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
However,

424
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
The exit

425
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,660
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

426
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
This is transmitted to England

427
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
There are two models

428
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
One day

429
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Their master

430
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
By the enemy

431
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Captive

432
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
It became

433
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
The enemy is

434
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Huge power

435
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,660
have

436
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,660
The two models

437
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
fear

438
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

439
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
Instead

440
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
You guys

441
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Once menarche occurs

442
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
At one time

443
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,660
Life is

444
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

445
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
where

446
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
To the two of them

447
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
It's a problem

448
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
yes

449
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Here is my question for you:

450
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Here is my question for you:

451
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
Captive

452
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
It became

453
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
The two models

454
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
Corridor

455
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Railway City

456
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
First

457
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

458
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
In front of me

459
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Will it be a draw?

460
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Or

461
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
On the diagram

462
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Shine

463
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
want

464
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
I wonder

465
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Which one?

466
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
think

467
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
I wanted

468
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Draw?

469
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
I

470
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Draw

471
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
I was watching

472
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I think

473
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Why

474
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

475
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

476
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

477
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
For the Lord

478
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Death unexpectedly

479
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

480
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
If I die,

481
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

482
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
you can't

483
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
that's why

484
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
no matter how

485
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,660
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

486
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Alive

487
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
Something

488
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Nasaneba and

489
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
I thought

490
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I

491
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
I was looking at the stars

492
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,660
I think...

493
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

494
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Two people

495
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
It's a kiss

496
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
They were looking at the stars!

497
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
It will be engraved

498
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
So

499
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
So

500
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
How did you live?

501
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
So what!

502
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
Cherish it

503
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
in the end

504
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
They

505
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Himself

506
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Nothing in hand

507
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Not included

508
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
But they—

509
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
解鋼

510
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Helplessness

511
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
They

512
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
What I saw

513
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
It's a draw

514
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
They

515
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Teaching

516
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Alive

517
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
What

518
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
this

519
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,660
What they saw was the mud!

520
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
What they saw was the mud!

521
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

522
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

523
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Thank you

524
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
you

525
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
It's a rule

526
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
It's a thing

527
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Take it away

528
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Listen!

529
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Listen!

530
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
To fulfill that responsibility

531
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Alive

532
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
What to do

533
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

534
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
I

535
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Both of them

536
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
That far

537
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
At this time

538
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
That’s enough, you two.

539
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
That’s enough, you two.

540
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
People

541
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660
A country of eyes and colors

542
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
live

543
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
So

544
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Reach out

545
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
What you can see is

546
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you want

547
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Or

548
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Which one

549
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
Both

550
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,660
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

551
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Lyrics

552
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Don't you want to drive?

553
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
It's spose

554
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,660
moreover

555
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
I came with you

556
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660

a lot

559
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
It's the voice.

560
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Today is exactly

561
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Shukyo

562
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
If you lose

563
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
yes

564
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
Basso

565
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Everyone

That far

567
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,660
The Winner is

where triumph goes to the victor</i>

569

570
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,660
Decide who is the king

571
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,660
Return

572
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

573
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

574
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
So

575
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Come out

576
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660

593
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660

594
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660

595
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660

597
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660

605
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660

606
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660

607
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,660

608
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,660

609
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660

610
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660

614
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,660

615
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660

616
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660

617
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,660

618
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660

619
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660

620
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660

621
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,660
1

622
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?

623
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,660
Let's do it!

624
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,660
Alright, let’s do it!

625
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Alright, let’s do it!

626
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
It's Hong!

627
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
It's Feeket!

628
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
Yay!

629
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Nodknocky!

630
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,660
That’s the bell!

631
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
That’s the bell!

632
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Ah...

633
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,660
thing!

634
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Y-y-y-take ra!

635
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Feeket!?

636
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
Hey, how are you?

637
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,660
D ص PAR!

638
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,660
Ichikowa

639
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,660
Our king! Our king!

640
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I think my finger went in his eye.

641
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,360
I think my finger went in his eye.

642
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,740
I think my finger went in his eye.

643
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,220
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

644
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,540
So why don't you stop!

645
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,900
Hubber, everyone!

646
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:16,660
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

647
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:24,660
It feels like he’s invading my life.

648
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,660
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>

649
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:36,660
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>

650
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,660
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>

651
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:48,660
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

652
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,660
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

653
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,660
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

654
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:08,660
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

655
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,660
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

656
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:25,660
You’re...

657
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:37,660
My hanky...

658
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Hey, what's the flower pressure?

659
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

660
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,660
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

661
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Has it caught your fancy?

662
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.

663
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
I don't care

664
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,660
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.

665
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Mexico...

666
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,660
When girls were just born

667
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,660
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.

668
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,660
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

669
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:37,660
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

670
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Are you interested in it?

671
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Oh, no. Not especially.

672
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:48,660
that

673
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,660
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

674
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Danny's attitude towards women

675
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,660
Friendship? With a dog?

676
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,660
Friendship? With a dog?

677
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,660
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

678
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,660
I won it.

679
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,660
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

680
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,660
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

681
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

682
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,660
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

683
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:27,660
My voice is all alone and no one can hear it

684
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,660
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

685
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

686
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

687
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,660
Danny jumps into the river

688
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,660
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

689
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,660
I know what life is

690
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

691
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

692
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Danny's feelings

693
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

694
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Since then they

695
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,660
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

696
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

697
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Dangaso too

698
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,660
ah

699
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,660
it was

700
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Erina!

701
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Butterfly

702
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,660
The two resumed

703
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,660
love

704
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

705
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I took a few actions.

706
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
The two who are waiting to win

707
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,660
I was in love

708
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,660
Danny

709
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Be well behaved

710
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

711
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,660
What are you hiding?

712
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
no

713
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
It’s nothing interesting.

714
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
It’s nothing interesting.

715
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

716
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I won’t laugh.

717
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
I won’t laugh.

718
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
I won’t tell, so show me!

719
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
I won’t tell, so show me!

720
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
No.

721
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
butterfly

722
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Elina

723
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
Just call

724
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,660
Feelings

725
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
Relax

726
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,660
What kind of music

727
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
The sound

728
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

729
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,660
What's going well

730
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,660
already

731
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,660
<i>To be laughing like this</i>

732
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,660
Morning or quite

733
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Bab

734
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,660
The sky gets higher

735
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,660
<i>Erina</i>

737
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,660
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

739
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,660
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,660
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

743
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
This one

744
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,660
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

745
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,660
forever

746
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,660
One word

747
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,660
I'm happy

748
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,660
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

749
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

750
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Here

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,660
tickles

752
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,660
you

753
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
People who can't hear

754
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,660
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>

755
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,660
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

756
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,660
Put on Jariun

757
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,660
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

758
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
<i>My hand,</i>

759
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,660
<i>My hand,</i>

760
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Touching

761
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
be confused

762
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

763
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
To be continued

764
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,660
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

765
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,660
Trembling

766
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,660
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

767
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
surely

768
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660

769
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
Hawatsu

770
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Preconceived notions

771
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
It’s already this late!

772
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,660
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

773
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

774
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Elina

775
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Yes, JoJo!

776
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
Huh, okay?

777
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Huh

778
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,660
compete

779
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,660

780
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
you

781
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660

<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>

783
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,660
here we go

784
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Ugh

785
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Ugh

786
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Ugh

787
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,660
Ugh

788
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,660
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

789
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
Today is

790
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
What do you...

791
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
They were just playing

792
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,660
What do you...

793
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
something

794
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
wall

795
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Ugh

796
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Ugh

797
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Ugh

798
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
Ugh

799
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,660
Ugh

800
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Ugh

801
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Ugh

802
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Ugh

803
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Ugh

804
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Ugh

805
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Ugh

806
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Ugh

807
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Ugh

808
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Ugh

809
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Udo Yaa

810
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
here we go

811
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Cling

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
today

813
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
What can't be done on broken ground

814
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Do a transformation and get out

815
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

816
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

817
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Not yet

818
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,660
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...

819
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
This is Dio

820
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,660
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

821
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
You bitch!

822
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,660
You bitch!

823
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
This woman!

824
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,660
Are you saying soroagaarau on purpose?

825
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
Wow!

826
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,660
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!

827
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

828
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

829
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Namaruka

00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
yes

831
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Father, mother’s clearly not well!

832
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
Oi, you hear me?

833
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,660
Oi, you hear me?

834
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
Kanaki Koiyori

835
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,660
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

836
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!

837
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,520
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!

838
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,640
Izawa Hiamatress

839
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:45,860
宙zech

840
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,860
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?

841
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,860
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!

842
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Eni

843
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?

844
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,860
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!

845
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
at least

846
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,860
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!

847
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,860
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!

848
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,860
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!

849
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,860
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.

850
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
Magara

851
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Crack

852
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Well, my breasts are always twisted and swaying.

853
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,860
I noticed it too early and stepped on it

854
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Yes, it's Joes.

855
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,860
You and I are different!

856
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Follow

857
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,860
I am

858

With you

859
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Haa

Haa

864
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Haa

Haa

868
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,860
<i>What in the world have I ever done
to you?! Can you tell me, Dio?</i>

869
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
Hurt her

870
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Haa

871
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
I want to go

872
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,860
I admired you!

873
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,860
Why?

874
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Oh

875
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Haa

876
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,860
You are amazing

877
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,860
Much more than me

878
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,860
I respect that.

879
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
<i>But now there is a single
flame that burns in my heart</i>

880
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
One thing is for sure

881
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

882
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,860
Oh no

883
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,860
Haa

884
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Many people's names

885
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Easy to wear

886
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
A small person

887
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,860
I heard that

888
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,860
My love

889
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860
you

890
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,860
Kyusana

891
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,860
I'm the one

892
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,860
I don't care

893
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,860
nine

894
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,860
Haa

895
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Haa

896
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
Haa

897
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,860
Stand up to it

898
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,860
No shoulders

899
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
this

900
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,860
I can't lose

901
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,860
Oh

902
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
Emotions

903
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,860
Dominate

904
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Not like him

905
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860
Slippery Heart

906
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,860
Her name

907
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,860
Get it back

908
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
Oh no

909
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,860
Come at me!

910
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,860
Come at me!

911
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,860
I'll make you understand

912
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
Oh no

913
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Haa

914
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
you

915
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
I miss you

916
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,860
Get to know

917
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,860
That's a good impression.

918
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:09,860
Haa

919
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,860
Haa

920
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,860
Haa

921
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,860
Haa

922
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,860
Haa

923
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Haa

924
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,860
Haa

925
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,860
This heart

926
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,860
You

927
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Give it to me

928
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
Only

929
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
Oh no

930
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
You

931
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860
You

932
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
Until Naku

933
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,860
like this

934
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,860
Lost

935
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,860
Don't bend

936
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
Haa

937
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
Haa

938
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
Haa

00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Haa

940
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
often

941
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,860
too

942
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
To me

943
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Bukase

944
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860

945
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
Konoha

Better

947
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Like this

948
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Like winning

949
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Cheap

950
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,860
This me

Looks good on you

953
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

This me

957
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
What on earth is going on?!

958
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,860
Haa

959
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,860
Haa

960
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,860
One

961
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
What's going on?

962
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Both of them

963
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,860
Give a penalty

964
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,860
Go back to your room

965
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,860
Haa

966
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860

Haa

976
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Haa

977
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860

Haa

982
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Haa

983
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,860

00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,860
Haa

990
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,860

Haa

997
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Haa

998
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Haa

999
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
Haa

1000
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,860
Haa

1001
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860

1002
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,860

Haa

1008
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,360
I underestimated JoJo.

1009
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
I have to become stronger...

1010
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,360
His explosive power

1011
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,360
I have to control my anger and stay calm...

1012
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,360
So that I can take everything from him!

1013
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I need to calm down and control my mind more.

1014
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,360
To get it all

1015
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,360
But

1016
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Ah, it burns!

1017
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Someone! Someone please help!

1018
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Are you going to try to go outside?

1019
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,360
Oh my god

1020
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Someone please

1021
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
Hmm

1022
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Then Pan Seventies

1023
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
First place

1024
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Bistriest

1025
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Ride behind

Aprekaeru Korori

1027
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
What about artificial?

1028
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,360
<i>London’s peace has one
of its fingers broken</i>

1029
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
<i>The map of London
paints a stark contrast</i>

1030
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,360
<i>Chaotic days mix the old and the new</i>

1031
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Melting Up Ten

1032
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Listening to British culture

1033
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Chaochao

1034
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360

Rowan peas on index finger

1038
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I'm sleeping

1039
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
Port Levy

1040
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,360
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

1041
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,360
The one excavated from Mexico?

1042
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
Focusing on the darkness

1043
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
It was quite a while ago...

1044
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
That's Portobello

1045
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,360
Port's own market

1046
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,360
Is that correct?

1047
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Stone Turtle

1048
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Excavated in Mexico

1049
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,360
And bought it from me at a high price—

1050
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

1051
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
And bought it from me at a high price—

1052
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,360
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

1053
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,360
But there's no doubt about it

1054
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

1055
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
I don’t trust you...

1056
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1057
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Okay

1058
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,360
I did it

1059
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
I bought it

1060
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
in

1061
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Where is Soroshinshi now?

1062
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,360
It seems a bit suspicious

1063
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,360
All the way from Italy?!

1064
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,360
What is it?

1065
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,360
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

1066
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
My name is

1067
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
Seteri

1068
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,360
Thank you.

1069
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,360
By the stone turtle

1070
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
I'm from Italy

1071
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
Just a little word of warning...

1072
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
The sun will be setting soon.

1073
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,360
The sun will be setting soon.

1074
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,360
I'll do some research

1075
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Please wait

1076
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
April

1077
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Ha

1078
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,360
I'll give you a little China.

1079
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Will the sun soon set?

1080
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,360
You'd better not go beyond that street.

1081
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
Kiri appeared

1082
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,360
The sun stops

1083
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
Until then

1084
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,360
When I'm in town

1085
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
topknot

1086
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Please drink it

1087
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,360
I don't know you

Reach out your hand

Voices around

1094
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,360
I don't want to fall

1095
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Laughter and no laughter

1096
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,360
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

1097
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

1098
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:26,360
Thrown away in the dump

1099
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Better

Something's wrong

1105
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm sure it's because I'm dry

1106
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,360
Until then

1107
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
surely

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,360

Woah!

Just bring my smile back a little closer

00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,260
Dark dark girl

1157
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,280
Ba be rinen

1158
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,440
Silence

1159
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,280
Get your mind back

1160
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,500
Recruitment is against

1161
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,500
Night night night night night Shalal ...

1162
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,420
<i>(In perfect harmony, they
make the best partners!)</i>

1163
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,840
I want to meet you, that's it

1164
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,580
Just a little

1165
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,780
The final match of the
season ends in victory!

1166
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,900
Chochocho Maca's family car

1167
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,060
So it's the last game

1168
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,380
Winning the championship

1169
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,860
a little bit

1170
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,840
It's on the bottom right

1171
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,840
Thanks to your parts

1172
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,680
First, let's tell Dad about this victory.

1173
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Magician's Palace

1174
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,840
Thanks to you

1175
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,140
In the school scene

1176
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,640
Can you tell me about your friendship?

1177
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,640
thank you

1178
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,040
<i>Ever since you started
calling him “Father”</i>

1179
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,540
Let's go home together

1180
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,540
Like water you don't ask for

1181
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Time passed

1182
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,840
You

1183
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,840
With Dad

1184
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,840
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

1185
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
To me

1186
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,340
Those familiar words

1187
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,840
think

1188
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,340
7 years

1189
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,340
Checking your calculations

1190
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,840
You are

1191
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,340
beautifully

1192
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,340
It was believed

1193
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,340
Make my Elio come true

1194
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,340
Friends

1195
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,340
think

1196
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,340
Elinae's

1197
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,840
Ayamachi

1198
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,340
You are

1199
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,840
I was eating

1200
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,340
Danny's replacement

1201
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
You are

1202
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,840
He supported me.

1203
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Ahead of me

1204
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,840
Your back

1205
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,840
there were

1206
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
7 years

1207
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
Where

1208
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
walked

1209
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
However

1210
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,840
Why am I

1211
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
To you

1212
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:37,840
How are you feeling?

1213
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,840
Thanks to

1214
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!

1215
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,840
Seem to have won!

1216
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
If it continues this long

1217
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
teeth

1218
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,840
I'm getting old

1219
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,840
Not yet

1220
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,840
ah

1221
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
oh yeah

1222
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,840
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.

1223
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Skilled

1224
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Dioplant

1225
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
they

1226
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,840
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

1227
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:23,840
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

1228
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Joe was Dibbala Singh Singh

1229
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,840
It was a brilliant stop in the field of high school studies.

1230
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Dio-kun is the number one in law.

1231
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
Graduation

1232
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,840
I can’t get rid of this cough...

1233
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,840
Danda-sama

1234
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,840
I just got home

1235
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,840
I object!

1236
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,840
And Jojo too

1237
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,840
Are you okay, Dad?

1238
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,840
They say it’s a problem in London too.

1239
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Today the doctor recommended I be admitted to hospital.

1240
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
I give in.

1241
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,840
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.

1242
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!

1243
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,840
Inspector Archer here told me.

1244
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,840
Inspector Archer here told me.

1245
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:26,840
The swelling in my hands and the pain in my chest will subside.

1246
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Congratulations to both of you on your wins

1247
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,840
Oh no, silly me!

1248
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,840
I truly am proud.

1249
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
I truly am proud.

1250
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Cave

1251
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,840
we

1252
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,840
I just want to see your happy face

1253
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,840
I could have just stoned it.

1254
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,840
I'm here

1255
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,840
I was born poor...

1256
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,840
wonderful

1257
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,840
There are already few

1258
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,840
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

1259
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

1260
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,840
But this is Liverpool!

1261
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,840
Be what you want to be

1262
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
To me, born of poor origins

1263
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,840
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

1264
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,840
thank you

1265
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,840
So I'm going to use this cable.

1266
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Thank you for always coming.

1267
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,840
thank you

1268
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,840
The tip of the cut is exposed.

1269
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
It's the sound that has made lies a part of the world.

1270
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,840
No, this is Liverpool.

1271
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
anywhere

1272
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Like that guy

1273
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
There are people who don't have the full amount.

1274
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
So

1275
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,840
do

1276
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,840
staff

1277
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,840
It's a living mechanism that responds only to

1278
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,840
Who and for what purpose?

1279
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,840
Thank you again, Master Dio—

1280
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Maybe I can make something happen on my way home from here

1281
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

1282
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

1283
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

1284
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,840
I am

1285
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Dario Pland

1286
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
I'm always sorry

1287
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Rio-san

1288
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
About giving medicine

1289
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Speed

1290
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,840
thank you

1291
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
I

1292
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1293
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1294
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1295
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
perhaps

1296
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
You will die

1297
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1298
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
Hands waving

1299
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

1300
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,840
My voice

1301
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,840
A voice calling you

1302
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,840
My mother died.

1303
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,840
Two of my fathers

1304
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,840
yes

1305
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,840
Those shoes and

1306
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,840
What

1307
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
Pawn

1308
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,840
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

1309
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
yes

1310
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
Until that day

1311
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
He died.

1312
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Zexal

1313
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
I was separated from my wife by the moon.

1314
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,840
Yes.

1315
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,840
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

1316
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
Right now

1317
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
Lowering scum

1318
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Battle and

1319
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Aha

1320
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
Hardness

1321
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,840
Threw it

1322
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
Assembled

1323
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,840
Because I don't need it anymore

1324
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,840
The match is

1325
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
Without love

1326
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,840
All those who were killed

1327
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Stolen

1328
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Shall I enter?

1329
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
Name

1330
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
It's different

1331
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,840
On the body

1332
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Flowing

1333
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,840
This hell

1334
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Zexal

1335
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,840
white

1336
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
This hunt

1337
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
All

1338
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,840
In these hands

1339
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,840
Win

1340
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Human

1341
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,840
To the End

1342
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Be prepared

1343
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Covering the wall

1344
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,840
Enough

1345
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Dio!

1346
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840

Swear on it.

Well, I'll be doing my second and third thesis. In the meantime, I've decided to give them a perfect tour. I will not be receiving any medicine or medical treatment except from them.

1456
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:23,440
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

I'm going to rip this Kilean Ajibainar off the spot.

01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.

1494
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000

If you lay a hand on that parent and child, you'll have to wait a little longer.

1498
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Why didn't you kick it as you pleased?

1499

I came here for the land

01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
…

1534
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Just now?

1535
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1536
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
What did you do to my mate?!

1537
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
My voice

1538
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I’ll kill you!

1539
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
{\an8}<i>Is another man’s fortune!</i>

1540
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Interesting, this is a good
opportunity to try it out!

1541
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Become the richest

1542
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
It’s a live human experiment!

1543
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1544
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
JoJo!

1545
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
This is what I'm hearing

1546
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Kitsutsu's face is blue

1547
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I’ll find the answer to your
research myself right now!

1548
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I gave Bamma a good sleep.

1549
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I'm sure

1550
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
This face

1551
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This face

1552
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
This face

1553
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Back of face

1554
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Wow

1555
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Wow

1556
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It's not even possible that it will be born

1557
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Inside

1558
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Earthquake Floyd

1559
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Delicious

1560
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's your fault

1561
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Wow

1562
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Was I hallucinating?

1563
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Pukula

1564
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,220
Should I do it or paint it?

1565
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,000
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.

1566
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Also, the company

1567
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Let me come over

1568
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It's a journey of success

1569
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Hehehehe

1570
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Well then

1571
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Your research is dissolved

1572
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'll do it

1573
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Do it

1574
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,000
Ah

1575
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,100
, not easy

1576
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,200
What

1577
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,100
What

1578
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,600
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>

1579
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,100
He’s sucking my blood!

1580
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,000
Dead

1581
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,800
If this much koshin is stabbed in the head, it's only natural that he'll be punished.

1582
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,000
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!

1583
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Not dead

1584
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:48,500
Mamachi

1585
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,500
15

1586
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
What is this guy?

1587
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,700
Sue

1588
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,300

1592
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,600
then

1593

already

1600
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,360
ambitions

1601
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,960
I'm excited about you

1602
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,480
graders

1603
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,580
Are you flying?

1604

1605

1607
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,700
maybe add orca Bureau

1608
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,380
If there was nothing like that

1609
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,660
me

1610
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:49,360
Please use the foyer.

1611
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,360
In sunlight

1612
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,360
This is my cross to bear.

1613
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,360
This is

1614
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,360
This happened when you were a baby.

1615
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,360
So, Deo

1616
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,360
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.

1617
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,360
Support us right away!

1618
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,360
Use your hair

1619
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,360
thank you

1620
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Hey

1621
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,360
That way of asking

1622
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
Bring Wyche.

1623
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,360
Chocho

1624
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,360
It's great

1625
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:54,360
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1626
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,360
picture?

1627
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,360
I...

1628
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,360
I arrested the criminal!

1629
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
I arrested the criminal!

1630
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,360
He’s certain to be exiled!

1631
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,360
He’s certain to be exiled!

1632
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,360
For you

1633
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360
I'll tell you

1634
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,360
You

1635
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1636
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
surely

1637
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,360
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,

1638
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,360
But a thief!

1639
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,360
No notification was submitted.

1640
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Finger speech

1641
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,360
A man who fell in and out

1642
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,360
Corresponding

1643
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,360
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1644
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
Jostar Kyoga

1645
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
Why?

1646
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1647
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Something special made in pairs

1648
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,360
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1649
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,360
picture?

1650
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,360
this is

1651
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,360
This is a finger spelling I made with my wife.

1652
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Today is

1653
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
My wife

1654
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Did you find it?

1655
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,360
That I gave him this ring?

1656
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
I

1657
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,360
This is what I gave him.

1658
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Would you like to wish me a happy birthday?

1659
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,360
Recorded items

1660
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1661
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1662
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1663
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
Understood

1664
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,360
curler

1665
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,360
Hey

1666
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,360
Woody

1667
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Planned

1668
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,360
Planned

1669
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,360
Stop

1670
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,360
Well then

1671
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
Dario Pland is

1672
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,360
Even with life and onjin

1673
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,360
Nothing

1674
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,360
Just

1675
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,360
It's Nust

1676
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,360
Just a lie

1677
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,360
That

1678
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
I know

1679
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,360
Dio

1680
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,360
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1681
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
Why

1682
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,360
I

1683
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,360
Today's

1684
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,360
At that time

1685
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,360
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1686
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,360
Tears

1687
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,360
you

1688
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,360
he

1689
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Didn't I say this?

1690
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,360
This sign language is

1691
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,360
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>

1692
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
There was a picture

1693
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Ugh

1694
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
Yes.

1695
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,360
this is

1696
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
What I gave him

1697
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,360
He is innocent

1698
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Yao's wife

1699
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
It's hard

1700
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Mr. Pland

1701
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,360
yes

1702
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,360
This is yours

1703
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,360
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>

1704
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,360
hand

1705
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,360
To my family

1706
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,360
Please buy me something

1707
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,360
Just a lie

1708
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,360
Why that?

1709
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
Deserveo

1710
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,360
If I

1711
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,360
In a strange way

1712
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
suffering

1713
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,360
If we had met

1714
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,360
The same thing

1715
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Did you?

1716
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,360
picture

1717
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:33,360
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>

1718
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,360
The stars in the sky

1719
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,360
Light Yes

1720
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,360
Eventually

1721
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:45,360
<i>That pain</i>

1722
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,360
This friend

1723
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,360
Shibi

1724
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
Darkness

1725
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,360
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1726
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:58,360
Prayer place

1727
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:01,360
thank you

1728
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,360
you

1729
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
You're too kind

1730
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,360
This evil and

1731
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,360
It's warming in my heart

1732
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Maybe so

1733
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
But

1734
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,360
That’s why...

1735
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,360
Something called destiny

1736
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,360
from

1737
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,360
People

1738
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,360
Tell me

1739
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,360
Forget

1740
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,360
That courage

1741
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,360
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1742
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:36,360
Let's hug

1743
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:41,360
Orimo

1744
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:47,360
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1745
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,360
To everything

1746
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,360
Garu

1747
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,360
I

1748
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,360
Inspector.

1749
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,360
He can still be stopped.

1750
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,360
For your viewing pleasure

1751
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,360
Good

1752
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,360
it is

1753
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,360
someday

1754
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:11,360
Kakaya

1755
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Gudarou

1756
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
There is another

1757
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,360
On the tray

1758
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
I

1759
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,360
Shichizuki

1760
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:30,360
Aki's Ambulance

1761
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,360
a

1762
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:39,360
bothersome

1763
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:49,360
Noroi

1764
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,360
nine

1765
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,360
I

1766
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,360
Waiting for Dio

1767
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,360
still

1768
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,360
Can be stopped

1769
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,360
You

1770
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,360
I heard Nauwa-san

1771
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,360
Frosia's man

1772
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,360
Already the wall

1773
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,360
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>

1774
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,360
And the man

1775
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>

1776
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,360
Can't enter

1777
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,360
I heard

1778
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,360
It's the same as 30 years ago

1779
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Just like back then

1780
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,360
Park of Memories

1781
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,360
nailed down

1782
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,360
Kusabi

1783
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,360
Systemic training

1784
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,360
That morning sun

1785
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,360
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>

1786
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,360
It was red

1787
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,360
Full of passion

1788
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:13,360
Longing for the road world

1789
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,360
My respected father

1790
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Hit the rolling sea

1791
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,360
My beloved father

1792
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,360
Voice of Things

1793
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,360
At my exact moment

1794
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,360
Day 1

1795
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,360
From this hand

1796
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,360
Take it all away

1797
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,360
Including force

1798
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,360
To get it back

1799
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,360
Tomorrow for sure

1800
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:54,360
Tomorrow for sure

1801
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,360
Even if you open it, I'm thinking

1802
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,360
Although you might not believe me,

1803
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,360
One day

1804
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,360
Although you might not believe me,

1805
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,360
It will become irreversible

1806
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,360
This hand...

1807
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,360
Therefore

1808
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,360
To turn myself in to the police.

1809
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:52,360
It's a shame, really.

1810
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,360
You may not understand, but this is the truth

1811
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,360
What I did was terrible!

1812
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,360
You are that kind of guy.

1813
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,360
Don’t believe a word he says!

1814
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,360
It's the last one

1815
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,360
Can you give me some time?

1816
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,360
Allow me to introduce myself!

1817
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,360
I

1818
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,360
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.

1819
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,360
Born into a poor family

1820
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,360
I got a palm.

1821
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,360
This man has confessed already.

1822
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,360
When words

1823
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:07,360
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1824
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,360
I will return to my bed to rest.

1825
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,360
I am

1826
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,360
I am

1827
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,360
Anyone

1828
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,360
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1829
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,360
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1830
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,360
I am

1831
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,360
He was born with an innate destiny.

1832
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,360
He was born with an innate destiny.

1833
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,360
I've been driving since it got stuck.

1834
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,360
I've seen a lot of different people

1835
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,360
So you can tell by the smell

1836
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:53,360
This guy is Bakise

1837
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,360
Really! The boy is already gone.

1838
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,360
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1839
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:11,360
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1840
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,360
or

1841
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,360
I don't want to see you get caught

1842
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,360
That man won't give up

1843
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,360
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1844
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,360
Sores!

1845
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,360
Girl, girl, I got it!

1846
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,360
You'll be released, but at least

1847
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,360
I want you to take over

1848
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,360
We've been together for seven years.

1849
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,360
Be careful!

1850
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,360
Understood

1851
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,360
I'll take the lead

1852
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:58,360
For humans

1853
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,360
There are limits

1854
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,360
I am

1855
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,360
I understand now

1856
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,360
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1857
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,360
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1858
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,360
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1859
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,360
I'm so frustrated

1860
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,360
The Stone Mask?

1861
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,360
The Stone Mask?

1862
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,360
The empty logo

1863
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,360
With a glance next to me

1864
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,360
<i>My humanity!</i>

1865
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,360
No matter how much I write

1866
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:52,360
Follow these eyes

1867
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,360
Do you understand?

1868
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,360
That smiling sky

1869
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,360
I want you to know me

1870
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,360
This hand is out of reach

1871
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,360
Shoot him!

1872
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,360
On that beautiful day

1873
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:12,360
This dumping ground will never disappear

1874
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,360
So now is the time

1875
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,360
Father! Father!

1876
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,360
Father! Father!

1877
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,360
Light

1878
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,360
One

1879
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,360
I am

1880
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,360
Mom

1881
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,360
Life

1882
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,360
It opens

1883
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,360
Right

1884
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,360
Yes

1885
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,360
Yes

1886
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,360
Yes

1887
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,360
please

1888
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,360
Yes

1889
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,360
Hahahaha

1890
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,360
Hahahaha

1891
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,360
Yes

1892
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,360
Yes

1893
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:39,140
Initial battle plan

1894
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:43,140
I'll take your mother's finger

1895
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,140
Firmly

1896
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:54,140
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1897
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,140
I've been hard on you

1898
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:07,140
Maybe when I got home I felt it was fair.

1899
01:29:07,140 --> 01:29:09,140
Shoot

1900
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:21,140
It doesn't seem bad

1901
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,140
Gradually

1902
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,140
The last one

1903
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,140
In my son's arms

1904
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:49,140
father

1905
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:53,140
Do it.

1906
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,140
After all, at that time

1907
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:58,140
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1908
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,140
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1909
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,140
Survey

1910
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:07,140
Whether it's a hearing or not

1911
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:10,140
I was always told

1912
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,140
Proudly

1913
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,140
everytime

1914
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:25,140
I said I'd save you

1915
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,140
I believe

1916
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:32,140
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1917
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,140
I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you

1918
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:44,140
What do you believe?

1919
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:48,140
Open the door

1920
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:51,140
What is pride?

1921
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:55,140
What's the purpose

1922
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:59,140
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1924
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,140
Always in judgement

1925
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:10,140
continued to exist

1926
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:13,140
Proudly

1927
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,140
Yourself

1928
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,140
Rishiki

1929
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,140
The voice of darkness

1930
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:26,140
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1931
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:28,140
Look up at the stars

1932
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:33,140
Put everything into it

1933
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:40,140
Inspector!

1934
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:43,140
Dance your heart out

1935
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Dance and shine

1936
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:54,140
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1937
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,140
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1938
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:02,140
Survey results

1939
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,140
Everything is connected

1940
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:09,140
It all makes sense

1941
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:15,140
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads
or tails of what’s happening!

1942
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:21,140
A single drop of courage

1943
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,140
It's Keiban and Daiyan.

1944
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,140
what up?

1945
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,140
That's the corpse

1946
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:39,140
Dion's body is missing.

1947
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,140
It became

1948
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:43,140
Satsuma

1949
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,140
Get away from the window

1950
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,140
Massage

1951
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:47,140
Keiban

1952
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:58,140
What is this guy, he's come back to life

1953
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,140
Even though I was interrupted by forgetting

1954
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,140
Be careful

1955
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,140
I have some bookies.

1956
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:07,140
Tomare

1957
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:10,140
Utero

1958
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:11,140
Don't be silly

1959
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,140
It's early

1960
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,140
If that’s the case...

1961
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,140
It was what was happening now

1962
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:28,140
Haa ...

1963
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:34,140
Are you waking up?

1964
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:38,140
Suddenly puffed up...

1965
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:45,140
Hiriamado is hard to laugh at

1966
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:53,140
You're J…

1967
01:33:53,140 --> 01:34:03,140
I've got such amazing power

1968
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:07,140
From someday

1969
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:14,140
Your father's power

1970
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,140
A quick fix to the running.

1971
01:34:17,140 --> 01:34:19,140
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1972
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:21,140
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1973
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:28,140
What do you think?

1974
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:32,140
I can only get a bad taste from Misonoru

1975
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:33,140
If it stops

1976
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,140
If you peel off the head completely

1977
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:49,140
Stop it!

1978
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:50,140
Menoeka!

1979
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:54,380
Already

1980
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,400
It's stronger

1981
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,740
Crab Cui Crab Cui

1982
01:35:23,140 --> 01:35:26,040
a!

1983
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,960
What?

1984
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:36,780
I'll enjoy this wonderful power for a little while longer.

1985
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:43,280
I don't know how far I can go yet

1986
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:53,100
Both specialists

1987
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:58,140
Don't give in to useless longings

1988
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,140
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1989
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:05,140
If you let it bloom,

1990
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,140
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1991
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:17,140
Well, don't hide in the shadows, come out

1992
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:20,140
Kisamalabop

1993
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:24,140
Let it be my life

1994
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,140
<i>JOJO: Please give me strength
DIO: For giving me strength</i>

1995
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:33,140
It's organic

1996
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,140
I can't beat this day

1997
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,140
Speed ​​Low

1998
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,140
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1999
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,140
Confusing

2000
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,140
Don't run upstairs

2001
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,140
ah

2002
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:00,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

2003
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:03,140
It's going up

2004
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,140
Well then

2005
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:07,140
I'm here

2006
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:10,140
Do you understand?

2007
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:14,140
Ladies, ladies, you first

2008
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:19,140
The more you run, the more light you scatter

2009
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,140
Today is your strength

2010
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,140
Finish eating

2011
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:27,140
It's useless, it's useless

2012
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:32,140
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

2013
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:35,140
This flickering

2014
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:38,140
Not from afar

2015
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:41,140
Let's give one

2016
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:46,140
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

2017
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,140
From now on, always

2018
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:51,140
From your back

2019
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,140
On my back,

2020
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:55,140
There was someone in front

2021
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,140
My player is Kimetomo

2022
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:59,140
Final exam

2023
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:02,140
He also decided on his own

2024
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,140
Women

2025
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,140
Women's Palm

2026
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:08,140
You are burning

2027
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:10,140
I'm dead

2028
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,140
I lost it immediately

2029
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:16,140
This body is immortal.

2030
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:18,140
That too

2031
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:19,140
Burning

2032
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:20,140
Heat it up

2033
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,140
That is

2034
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,140
The only one dying will be you!

2035
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,140

is flickering in flames)</i>

2036

More firepower

2037
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:40,140

2038
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,140

2039
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,140
more

2040
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,140
More firepower

2041
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:46,140
Throw away

2042
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,140
The knife you stabbed Father with!

2043
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,140
If you do

2044
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,140
<i>With this final bit of strength</i>

2045
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,140

It's your fault, I almost fell into the basement

2070
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:48,140
Where do you approach? I've grown fond of you

2071
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:54,140
As I thought, this crying that won't let go was there

2072
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:56,640
You're the type who stands up for yourself

2073
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,640
My chest is insecure

2074
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:06,140

01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:20,140
is definitely a reality

2108
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:25,140
And it gets weirder from here

2109
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:28,140
Yeah, strangely.

2110
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:33,140
At that time, the mansion was almost completely engulfed and collapsed.

2111
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:37,140
But Chosa was still there

2112
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:39,140
I was attacked by Dio

2113
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,140
But I lost everything

2114
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:46,140
Then see

2115
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:12,140
You slept for three whole days!

2116
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:17,140
You slept for three whole days!

2117
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:21,140
The mansion! Everyone is—

2118
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:25,140
there were

2119
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:29,140
there were

2120
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:33,140
there were

2121
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:43,140
I can hear the voice of your face, the voice that reads you

2122
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:48,140
This is my father’s hospital.

2123
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:51,140
This is me, but...

2124
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:57,140
It’s really been too long.

2125
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:01,140
<i>I was weak back then,
I couldn’t run to your side</i>

2126
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,140
That's why I came

2127
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,140
I have enough vocabulary

2128
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:07,140
Please come on the 5th.

2129
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:09,140
Are you okay?

2130
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:34,140
Can you hear me?

2131
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:43,140
Can you hear my voice?

2132
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:47,140
listened to each other

2133
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:53,140
Once again, when I see a vivid person

2134
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:57,140
Your voice

2135
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:08,140
I

2136
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:13,140
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

2137
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:15,140
All the mansions

2138
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:17,140
Please stay calm now

2139
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:20,140
We've passed the statistics, but times are still tough.

2140
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,140
<i>I can feel you there</i>

2141
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:27,140
You've been nursing me

2142
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:32,140
You are Yamasaka

2143
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:34,140
But they look similar

2144
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:37,140
Who do you think looks like me? Erina Pendleton

2145
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2146
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,140
Female Joestar

2147
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:44,140
Why

2148
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,140
This is my father's hospital

2149
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:48,140
India moved too far seven years ago.

2150
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,140
I recently planned

2151
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:54,140
It's really been a while

2152
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:57,140
I was weak

2153
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:02,140
It wasn't my first time with you

2154
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:05,140
It was me who was young

2155
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:10,140
I couldn't face you

2156
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:14,140
That voice remains unchanged

2157
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:18,140
This voice remains unchanged

2158
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:22,140
Vivid reverb

2159
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:26,140
The sky gets higher

2160
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:30,140
Erina JoJo

2161
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:34,140
<i>It was the same method, another woman—</i>

2162
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:42,140
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

2163
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:49,140
Elina

2164
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:50,140
sorry

2165
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:53,140
My mind is shaking and I lose consciousness

2166
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:56,140
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

2167
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:59,140
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

2168
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:03,140
Eye to eye

2169
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:07,140
If you touch it, it's there

2170
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:10,140
Plainness is courage

2171
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:15,140
Moving on to tomorrow

2172
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:19,140
Hand in hand

2173
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,140
Touch and there

2174
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:27,140
When our eyes meet

2175
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:31,140
Oh, it’s already so late!

2176
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:36,140
I have to return home soon...

2177
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,140
overlap

2178
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:42,140
attract

2179
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:45,140
fit

2180
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:47,140
That day

2181
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:53,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2182
01:48:55,140 --> 01:48:57,140
destiny

2183
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,140
yes

2184
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:01,140
The encounter of people

2185
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:05,140
Maybe it's decided by fate

2186
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,140
Kitty Dwagon

2187
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,140
Cool!

2188
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:21,140
Who goes there?

2189
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:24,140
Who goes there?

2190
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:27,140
lover

2191
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,140
See you again soon

2192
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,140
It's a camera

2193
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,140
Heaven and earth are the same woman

2194
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:35,140
A girl

2195
01:49:35,140 --> 01:49:37,140
Early afternoon

2196
01:49:37,140 --> 01:49:41,140
Its Appearance

2197
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:45,140
The agreement is mutual

2198
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:51,740
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2199
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:59,340
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2200
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:02,840
It's going to happen. He's going to appear.

2201
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:09,840
London is also popular

2202
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:13,200
It's getting chaotic, I don't know anything about it

2203
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:15,480
Black people don't eat

2204
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:19,740
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

2205
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:23,440
What do you know about me?!

2206
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,520
Chasing the ripples

2207
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:30,300
I wanted to convey

2208
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,600
This mod official

2209
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:34,800
<i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>

2210
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:38,300
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

2211
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:42,300
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

2212
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,300
Me, afraid?!

2213
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:48,300
That’s right!

2214
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:55,300
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

2215
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:59,300
Even though we're talking

2216
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:12,300
Play until the end of the night

2217
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:17,300
Relax

2218
01:51:24,300 --> 01:51:25,300
Who is it?

2219
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,300
you

2220
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,300
I liked it

2221
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,300
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

2222
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,300
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

2223
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:44,300
There's no more of that

2224
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,300
Reborn now

2225
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,300
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2226
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,300
I have to heal my ache

2227
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,300
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2228
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:57,300
So I feel less fulfilled

2229
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:01,300
Don't you want power?

2230
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,300
Solve the Wonders

2231
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:07,300
I'll give it to you

2232
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:13,300
Man is bound by all treasures

2233
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:15,300
I fear great evil

2234
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,300
But very rarely

2235
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:18,300
Without all treasure

2236
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,300
There is an evil elite

2237
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:22,300
Me

2238
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,300
You are

2239
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,300
How about it?

2240
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:26,300
The Stone Mask...

2241
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:27,300
To you

2242
01:52:27,300 --> 01:52:29,300
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

2243
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:32,300
Yes.

2244
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,300
So you

2245
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:36,300
It has to have been.

2246
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,300
I can dance to your heart's content

2247
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:39,300
Such

2248
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,300
Covered in the distance

2249
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:42,300
Such

2250
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,300
Lose too much

2251
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:47,300
What’s wrong?

2252
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:48,300
Who’s that?

2253
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,300
It seems like it will change

2254
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,300
Has he been here
this whole time?

2255
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:51,300
Yes.

2256
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,300
Well then

2257
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,300
Jonathan Joestar!

2258
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:58,300
More spinning than ever before in my hands

2259
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:59,300
This is

2260
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
Such as

2261
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,300
do not have

2262
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:05,300
It's crowded

2263
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:08,300
The Stone Mask?!

2264
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,300
You

2265
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,300
Come stretch

This hand

2269
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,300
Anyway

That's not right

2274
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:27,300
There

2275
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:29,300
To this time

2276
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:32,300
<i>I am Baron Zeppeli!</i>

It's a hobby

It's a hobby

01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,960
yes

2296
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,280
It's okay

2297
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:40,680
Are you okay

2298
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,840
let's go

2299
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,300
Huh?

2300
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:49,300
what happened?

2301
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:51,300
Who is it?

2302
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:53,300
I've been here for a while now

2303
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,300
Jora-san Choustar-kun

2304
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,300
Huh? And

2305
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:59,300
Miss Elida Pendleton

2306
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,300
I'm surprised I survived

2307
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:07,300
<i>The ripple’s power
passes through the frog</i>

2308
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:09,300
Isukamen!

2309
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,300
Wait!

2310
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,300
Jola-san

2311
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,300
Oshipa

2312
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,300
Keep it open

2313
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,300
By air

2314
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:21,300
Wherever you go, you'll be disappointed.

2315
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,300
Becoming a mites

2316
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,300
That's lame!

2317
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,300
The air seems to be tight

2318
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,300
No appearance

2319
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:31,300
I am Separi Danshak

2320
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,300
All I have is courage

2321
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,300
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.

2322
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,300
I'm your friend

2323
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,300
Your breathing

2324
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,300
To him

2325
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,300
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!

2326
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:45,300
Yes! The power of breathing!

2327
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,300
I'm your perspective

2328
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:49,300
Jora-san Jowstar

2329
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,300
What is it?

2330
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,300
What's that pain?

2331
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,300
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

2332
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,300
Appearance

2333
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,300
Give me one

2334
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,300
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

2335
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:03,300
Follow me

2336
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,300
Just now I

2337
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,300
Eyes change

2338
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,300
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

2339
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,300
I love you

2340
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,300
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

2341
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,300
This breathing

2342
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,300
The place to wake up

2343
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:29,300
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

2344
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:31,300
Smart

2345
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,300
Smart

2346
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:35,300
Smart

2347
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:37,300
Smart

2348
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,300
Smart

2349
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,300
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

2350
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,300
Country Petunassau

2351
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,300
The concussion

2352
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,300
Hackopping

Tyaeaars

Energy is generated

2355
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,300
The name is

2356
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,300
Hamon Energy

2357
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:59,300
Horororororororororororororororororororororororororororo

2358
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:07,300
Hamon's attack

2359
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,300
Thank you

2360
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:13,300
To fight... That is my destiny!

2361
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,300
Dropped

2362
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,300
This is

2363
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:19,300
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

2364
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,300
Kokum brings

2365
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:23,300
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

2366
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:27,300
Smart

2367
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,300
Smart

Cocuille

2369
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:34,660
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

2370
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:37,460
Carrying heroes and adjusting responses

2371
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:39,660
The bond force converts that small amount of energy into

2372
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,780
Ah, let’s put it this way.

2373
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:45,700
This is made possible by a certain breathing routine.

2374
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:46,980
Breathing is the power of now

2375
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:48,740
Yes, the power of breathing

2376
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:56,220
Yes, I know

2377
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:57,180
Thinking about it

2378
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,860
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

2379
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:02,060
And that wave of energy

2380
01:58:02,060 --> 01:58:03,220
Dios

2381
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:07,180
Kamen is owned by someone who hasn't changed.

2382
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:11,300
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

2383
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:15,660
We’re already out of time.

2384
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,980
I followed Kamen

2385
01:58:17,980 --> 01:58:19,860
Destroying and eating

2386
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,860
Dio is alive

2387
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,220
Just catch cute

2388
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:26,540
I can’t get you involved in this!

2389
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:28,540
In the hands of destruction

2390
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,340
Well, is there any more?

2391
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:31,340
Yours

2392
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,660
Your world

2393
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:35,900
I swear I’ll come back here again.

2394
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:37,900
I finally found it

2395
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,300
Tattered and worn

2396
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:41,980
Do you accept it?

2397
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,780
Eyes working hard

2398
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:48,740
Everything was discussed

2399
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:51,740
Sma

2400
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:53,740
Sma

2401
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:56,020
Sma

2402
01:58:56,860 --> 01:58:59,660
Sma

2403
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:05,900
destiny

2404
01:59:12,380 --> 01:59:14,380
fight

2405
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:16,900
That's my destiny

2406
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:19,380
You mean me?

2407
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:21,260
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

2408
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:23,500
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

2409
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,100
Leave the humans to rest

2410
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:27,100
it is

2411
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:30,620
You must take blood energy from others.

2412
01:59:30,620 --> 01:59:31,940
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>

2413
01:59:31,940 --> 01:59:33,780
Mizukaru's blood flows

2414
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:36,340
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

2415
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:38,820
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

2416
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:41,060
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

2417
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:43,300
Yeah

2418
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:45,300
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2419
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:52,340
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>

2420
01:59:52,340 --> 01:59:55,740
What do you think I should do?

2421
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:57,740
I'm starting to understand

2422
02:00:02,940 --> 02:00:04,140
Jamon

2423
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:05,820
If you hit another Hamon

2424
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:07,820
They'll explode

2425
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:09,900
And the tears of energy

2426
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:13,420
It has the same shape as the sunlight

2427
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,300
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

2428
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,700
yes

2429
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,540
There's no time

2430
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:22,940
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

2431
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,660
woman

2432
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,460
Dio

2433
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,740
Energy

2434
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:31,900
I won't get involved in anything that gets you involved

2435
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:35,100
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

2436
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:41,180
I'll definitely come back to this place

2437
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:46,540
This is

2438
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,780
Is it a female jamon?

2439
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:50,780
Yeah

2440
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:54,940
Haa

2441
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:19,180
Clouds flow

2442
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:22,060
The wind carries my thoughts

2443
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:24,060
Measurement

2444
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:27,100
go around

2445
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:31,580
I nodded.

2446
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:37,020
To your resolve

2447
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,860
In sadness

2448
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:47,820
Shining stars

2449
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:54,780
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2450
02:01:56,780 --> 02:02:01,100
I got stuck in the mud

2451
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:07,740
<i>I will live on!</i>

2452
02:02:09,580 --> 02:02:11,580
Left behind

2453
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:14,620
Living the dream

2454
02:02:14,620 --> 02:02:17,660
Wait by the window

2455
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:19,660
Loneliness is

2456
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:21,660
For whom?

2457
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:25,660
Even if it doesn't reach

2458
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:29,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2459
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:31,660
I want to scream

2460
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:35,660
I

2461
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2462
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:39,660
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

2463
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,660
I

2464
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,660
Because

2465
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,660
you

2466
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:49,660
There is light

2467
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,660
anytime

2468
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:55,660
Don't let your destiny lead you

2469
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:59,660
I

2470
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,660
Spending my days

2471
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:03,660
Let's live

2472
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:05,660
Why are you so strong?!

2473
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,660
While

2474
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,660
This place

2475
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,660
Someday you

He'll tell you

02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,660
Proudly

2478
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,660
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

2479
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,660
Your everything

2480
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:35,660
Acceptance

2481
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:39,660
Destiny and Love

2482
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,660
yes

2483
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:45,660
What was that, you old fart?

02:13:27,260 --> 02:13:28,260
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!

2674
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:30,260
Why stop place

2675
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:35,260
Be careful

2676
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:37,260
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

2677
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,260
Look!

Children on the right path

2686
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:50,900

2688
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:55,440

Wait, Dio!

2708
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:40,220
This is Kisstats' training ground.

2709
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:42,220
There are various tricks

2710
02:15:42,220 --> 02:15:45,220
And there's a big deal at that time.

Answer: Law, I want to make you my own Law

2726
02:16:39,940 --> 02:16:43,840

Long clouds hang over this country. Now is the time to speak up.

2731
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:13,100
A cry from the sky continues

2732
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:18,100
So much that there’s a hole in my cheek...

2733
02:17:18,100 --> 02:17:21,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

2734
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:25,100
Your cheek is melting,

02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:29,100
Your cheek is melting,

2736
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:34,100
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?

2737
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:38,100
The sun has set.

2738
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:43,100
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!

2739
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:47,100
It's scary

2740
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:53,100
Put your training to use.

2741
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:57,100
It's scary from the sky

2742
02:17:57,100 --> 02:18:02,100

02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:56,420
品積品積!

2858
02:23:56,420 --> 02:24:03,420
This shows that the length of the arms and the energy of the arms are related to the product.

2859
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:08,420
I can control my body freely.

2860
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:15,420
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2861
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:18,420
Breathe, breathe!

2862
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,420
Help!

2863
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:26,420
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2864
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:28,420
breathe?

2865
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:30,420
Conger eel?

2866
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:37,420
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2867
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:42,580
Hahaha

2868
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:52,180
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

2869
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:54,420
That's right.

2870
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,420
Do you remember?

2871
02:24:56,420 --> 02:25:05,420
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>

2872
02:25:05,420 --> 02:25:09,020
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2873
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:14,040
On the beard that was executed in the death knell

2874
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:18,180
Mary Stuart

2875
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:20,620
It was used there

2876
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:22,500
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2877
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,420
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2878
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:26,620
Dad's

2879
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,220
Now

2880
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:33,020
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2881
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:35,620
Jojon, Dion

2882
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:38,140
Today, this tradition is passed down in England.

2883
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:41,740
Let's talk about two Kishi

2884
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:44,540
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2885
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:45,500
Kishi's

2886
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:49,940
The rest of the story

2887
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:54,420
Once upon a time, 300 years ago

2888
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:58,900
Let's cheer on the two of us

2889
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:03,460
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2890
02:26:03,460 --> 02:26:07,940
Beautiful Mary Stuart

2891
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:12,460
Mary gave me that turgid

2892
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:15,940
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2893
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:19,140
Hahahahahaha

2894
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:21,060
From now on

2895
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:25,140
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2896
02:26:25,140 --> 02:26:27,540
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2897
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:29,940
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2898
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:34,740
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2899
02:26:34,740 --> 02:26:37,140
Two without two

2900
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:39,340
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2901
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:43,740
I think about it

2902
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:46,020
The Dearie Situation

2903
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:48,340
Find peace

2904
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:53,140
Use clothing

2905
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,340
Flowing Time

2906
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:56,340
It might be as you say, however—

2907
02:26:56,340 --> 02:26:57,460
By Elizabeth

2908
02:26:57,460 --> 02:26:59,540
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2909
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:01,940
It might be as you say, however—

2910
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:06,340
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2911
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:10,940
To save Mary

2912
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:15,340
To stop the grace of the two

2913
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:19,940
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2914
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:24,340
You guys should mess with us

2915
02:27:24,340 --> 02:27:31,140
Save Shugun's life.

2916
02:27:31,140 --> 02:27:33,440
To Elizabeth

2917
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:37,140
There is no denying it

2918
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:42,140
Our difficult story

2919
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:47,540
Because of this order

2920
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:49,540
It's so easy to get caught up in it

2921
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,940
I turned those two

2922
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:54,540
This system is unacceptable

2923
02:27:54,540 --> 02:27:56,940
I bowed my head

2924
02:27:56,940 --> 02:28:00,340
It's possible that it's lying around here like trash.

2925
02:28:00,340 --> 02:28:01,740
I'll keep it cool

2926
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:04,740
Because there is a semi-translated version

2927
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:09,340
Wow

2928
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:13,040
To Elizabeth who went behind the scenes

2929
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:18,440
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2930
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:23,040
Don’t you think so?

2931
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:25,340
With anger erupting

2932
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:27,440
That's why it resonates

2933
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:31,440
Kill them all!

2934
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:34,140
Bruford!

2935
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:36,440
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2936
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:39,840
I'll wait

2937
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:50,840
The way you feel—

2938
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:58,840
But I also bear my own burdens!

2939
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:00,840
A goosebump-inducing proposition

2940
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,540
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2941
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:05,140
But they should have done better.

2942
02:29:05,140 --> 02:29:07,840
I couldn't do anything in the first match.

2943
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:09,840
It can also be said that there is no waste.

2944
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,540
That man’s pride...

2945
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:13,740
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2946
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:16,440
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2947
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:18,640
It's all connected

2948
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:21,140
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2949
02:29:21,140 --> 02:29:23,840
I want to believe

2950
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:26,240
We’ll duel as knights!

2951
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:32,840
Run away, you two!

2952
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:35,040
I won’t let you interfere!

2953
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:44,640
I won’t let you interfere!

2954
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:48,040
Gradually

2955
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:54,040
Say it's your fault

2956
02:29:55,040 --> 02:30:05,040
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2957
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:12,040
The devil also created Bedbukhushki

2958
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:18,040
Don’t come any closer!

2959
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:20,040
Damn it...

2960
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:30,040
This is what you look like

2961
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:33,040
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2962
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:36,040
What an embarrassing sight

2963
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:39,040
Don't you think so?

2964
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:43,040
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2965
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,040
A continuation of that day

2966
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:48,040
Tarkus Bellaford

2967
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:50,040
The secret name Fansuar

2968
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:52,040
I'm tired

2969
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:55,040
Is revenge your answer?

2970
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:56,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2971
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:59,040
Slow Idiom Kiss Bellaford

2972
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,040
and Tarkus

2973
02:31:00,040 --> 02:31:02,040
I think that's a bit

2974
02:31:02,040 --> 02:31:05,040
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2975
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,040
But I also have something to carry

2976
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:11,040
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2977
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:14,040
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2978
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:19,040
The man's anger

2979
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,040
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2980
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,040
Old man!

2981
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,040
In this Braford

2982
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:28,040
I would like to draw every day of this man's life.

2983
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:31,040
Okay, that's good.

2984
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:34,040
Make a good list and get it

2985
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:39,040
If it hurts, run away

2986
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,040
Survey

2987
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:46,040
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2988
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:03,040
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2989
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,040
nailed down

2990
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,040
Wedge

2991
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:08,040
Anyway

2992
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:11,040
That morning sun

2993
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:12,040
Like this

2994
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:14,040
It was red

2995
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,040
Osa

2996
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:20,040
You live

2997
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,040
Now

2998
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,040
This pain means nothing to me!

2999
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,040
This pain means nothing to me!

3000
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:37,040
This pain means nothing to me!

3001
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,040
I'm not good

3002
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:40,040
Wait a minute

3003
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:41,040
Don't mess with me

3004
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:43,040
Even at a time like this

3005
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:44,040
Why aren’t you moving?

3006
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:45,040
Come

3007
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,040
Carefully

3008
02:32:46,040 --> 02:32:47,040
Continue

3009
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:48,040
Tomorrow for sure

3010
02:32:48,040 --> 02:32:50,040
Tomorrow for sure

3011
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:52,040
Make Irumide

3012
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,040
I kept chasing

3013
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,040
Remember

3014
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
You can feel pain!

3015
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
You can feel pain!

3016
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,040
That’s why...

3017
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,040
Kisana

3018
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,040
I stopped fighting you.

3019
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,040
and

3020
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,040
Once processed

3021
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,040
That's what happened

3022
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,040
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3023
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:14,040
Get on the Tokoro Bull Bus

3024
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:16,040
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3025
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:18,040
It's not pain

3026
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:19,040
already

3027
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
You are a great knight.

3028
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:22,040
You are human!

3029
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:24,040
Morning tomorrow

3030
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:25,040
Tomorrow

3031
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,040
Tomorrow

3032
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:28,040
Now

3033
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:31,040
There

3034
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:35,020
picture

3035
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:37,040
Tokewa

3036
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:38,040
Even if I return

3037
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:39,040
When

3038
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:40,040
I guess he did it

3039
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:47,040
Kiki's

3040
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:51,040
Looking back at the station

3041
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,360
Is it urgent?

3042
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:54,360
Don't wait for tomorrow

3043
02:33:54,360 --> 02:33:58,360
I start walking

3044
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:02,360
Should believe

3045
02:34:02,360 --> 02:34:06,360
It should be said that

3046
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:12,360
Tomorrow Now

3047
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,360
girl

3048
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:20,360
The Beat of Decision with You

3049
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:26,360
Why is it moving?

3050
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:29,360
When I looked into it

3051
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:31,360
That

3052
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:33,460
Hiding

3053
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:39,360
Pikima

3054
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:42,360
pain

3055
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:50,360
No or

3056
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:52,360
Just as I thought...

3057
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:56,360
You are feeling pain now

3058
02:34:58,360 --> 02:34:59,360
pain

3059
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:05,360
That's why I stopped being that Sarakai

3060
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:09,360
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3061
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,360
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3062
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,360
Human

3063
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:19,360
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3064
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:23,360
Sennorakashi

3065
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:28,360
This is a human being

3066
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,360
Because there are similarities

3067
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:35,360
What did he have to be joyful about!

3068
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:37,360
What did he have to be joyful about!

3069
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:47,360
How could you!

3070
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:50,360
I feel now

3071
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:52,360
Bravo

3072
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:57,360
I will dedicate to you the words engraved on my prefecture.

3073
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:03,360
Something like this

3074
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:06,360
and

3075
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:08,360
Let's go

3076
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:20,360
To save souls

3077
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:24,360
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3078
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:27,360
Come

3079
02:36:28,360 --> 02:36:31,360
Affection

3080
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:36,360
Affection

3081
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:41,360
No way

3082
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:45,360
To think he would defeat Kurokiko

3083
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:49,360
also

3084
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:52,360
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

3085
02:36:58,360 --> 02:36:59,360
Haybay Day

3086
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:02,360
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

3087
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,360
I tempted you

3088
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:12,360
What changes is not the outcome but the vile Hamon

3089
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:18,360
There’s no time to be sad.

3090
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:21,360
At the beginning of the season

3091
02:37:30,360 --> 02:37:33,360
Brami's brother

3092
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,960
Loss of motivation and enthusiasm

3093
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:46,380
驚

3094
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:52,360
Lots of Ou

3095
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:58,860
From now on

3096
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:04,860
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

3097
02:38:04,860 --> 02:38:08,860
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

3098
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:16,860
JoJo

3099
02:38:18,360 --> 02:38:26,360
Follow me for my last jamon

3100
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:28,360
<i>Into my spirit</i>

3101
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:31,360
JoJo!

3102
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:52,360
Wow

3103
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:56,060
always

3104
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,360
Search Chokil

3105
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:03,360
Add to the sound of the sir

3106
02:39:03,360 --> 02:39:08,360
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

3107
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:11,360
Carlton!

3108
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:14,360
Oklaine!

3109
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:16,240
Windows 4

3110
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:46,040
Hey, Jebel, Jebel, if you're gone, I'll be sad, but one day I'll destroy my eyes, but hey, I'm happy with my life. Finally, I've entrusted it to you.

3111
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:54,240
Hey, you're my hope.

3112
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:09,240
Once again, the sun's rays are spilling out of my arms.

3113
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:33,240
You taught me the meaning of my life, my destiny, and the greatness of being human - courage.

3114
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:53,240
The light that was received would seep in. In my heart, I felt as if I was both dead and breathing at the same time.

3115
02:40:53,240 --> 02:41:00,240
From now on, I'm coming into you. Thank you very much.

3116
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:15,240
Everything is connected, everything has a body.

3117
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:32,240
This pain, this pain that I believed,

3118
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:43,240
What your father gave you, what you gave you.

3119
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:55,240
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

3120
02:41:56,240 --> 02:42:07,240
There is one thing that is so certain that it is in my heart right now.

3121
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:16,240
Embrace it, because this moves,

3122
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:22,240
Look at the stars.

3123
02:42:23,240 --> 02:42:34,240
<i>What do I want?</i>

3124
02:42:35,240 --> 02:42:45,240
Light up the darkness and bring your return,

3125
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:51,240
Come back,

3126
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:20,240
happiness.

3127
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:39,240
Can't you hear me?

3128
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:45,240
I hear a voice calling to you,

3129
02:43:45,240 --> 02:43:51,240
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

3130
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:55,240
Call my name.

3131
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:59,240
Unlike you.

3132
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:03,240
Of being human...

3133
02:44:03,240 --> 02:44:08,240
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

3134
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:12,240
Laugh to live,

3135
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:16,240
Use and take everything,

3136
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:19,240
Disobey justice,

3137
02:44:19,240 --> 02:44:22,240
To all of Wasa,

3138
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:28,240
Use and take everything,

3139
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:31,240
The ends justify the means.

3140
02:44:31,240 --> 02:44:34,240
I will win,

3141
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:38,240
I will win,

3142
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:39,240
Laughing,

3143
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:41,240
I want it,

3144
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:42,240
All of this is fate!

3145
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:46,240
All of this is fate!

3146
02:44:47,240 --> 02:44:54,240
no one,

3147
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,240
Such righteousness!

3148
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:10,240
Well then,

3149
02:45:10,240 --> 02:45:14,240
And then died!

3150
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:19,240
And then died!

3151
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:24,240
what,

3152
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:31,240
The world you lost long ago,

3153
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:35,240
Is this a sad world hidden by dead people?

3154
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:43,240
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

3155
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:47,240
Lion

3156
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:50,240
Even history

3157
02:45:50,240 --> 02:45:53,240
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

3158
02:45:53,240 --> 02:46:02,240
For the sake of revenge...

3159
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:06,240
You're just scared

3160
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:11,240
Humans

3161
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:14,240
That's why I gave up being human

3162
02:46:19,240 --> 02:46:21,240
To get it

3163
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,240
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

3164
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:37,240
All you need is results

3165
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:42,240
I won

3166
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:47,240
The only result is that you are in control.

3167
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:51,240
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

3168
02:46:51,240 --> 02:46:52,240
But

3169
02:46:55,240 --> 02:46:57,240
How did you live?

3170
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,240
Paying to Fate

3171
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:05,240
What did you leave behind?

3172
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:07,240
Rumbling, rumbling, rumbling

3173
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:15,240
To me

3174
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,240
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

3175
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:24,240
dead

3176
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:33,240
Your

3177
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:38,240
Utterly pathetic!

3178
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,240
That's right

3179
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:55,240
smile

3180
02:47:57,240 --> 02:47:59,240
Going out as a faithful servant

3181
02:48:01,240 --> 02:48:02,760
The current situation is

3182
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:06,740
To tell the story behind

3183
02:48:07,240 --> 02:48:10,240
Ko how proprio

3184
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:13,240
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

3185
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:16,240
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

3186
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:18,240
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

3187
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,240
I'm good with tax

3188
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:20,240
shake alone

3189
02:48:21,500 --> 02:48:23,320
hahhh

3190
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:26,540
Finally, a name that stands out

3191
02:48:26,600 --> 02:48:28,840
What's left now

3192
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:31,260
2019

3193
02:48:31,260 --> 02:48:35,860
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3194

務 manual you

3195
02:48:39,220 --> 02:48:42,140
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

3196
02:48:42,140 --> 02:48:43,740
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3197
02:48:43,740 --> 02:48:45,680

3198
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:47,560
for that

3199
02:48:47,560 --> 02:48:48,560
pain

3200
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:50,720
No problem

3201
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:58,220
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

3202
02:48:58,220 --> 02:49:04,720
I've gained power, but this pain is gentle

3203
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:09,520
This smile broke before, you're a sloppy person

3204
02:49:09,520 --> 02:49:15,520
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

3205
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:18,520
Omelo, kill me

3206
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:24,520
Omelo, kill me

3207
02:49:24,520 --> 02:49:29,520
You threw me away and taught me the best, so I'll pour in the bargain sale in front of the meaning of selling you

3208
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:34,520
Yes, I did it. I knocked my hand down. That's wrong.

3209
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:41,840
It's a little rough, but it's a good hand

3210
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:45,020
緊弱緊弱

3211
02:49:45,020 --> 02:49:49,020
Sasasa, no no

3212
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:54,020
It's so tense, but it's actually deceiving you

3213
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:55,220
JoJo

3214
02:49:55,220 --> 02:50:01,020
Now you too will come to me, and death will resonate with you

3215
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:07,620
You ran away from humans

3216
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:11,940
What's not making me spill right now?

3217
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:16,080
This year just hit me

3218
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:17,580
I have surpassed humanity

3219
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:19,420
I can't keep up with you guys

3220
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:23,600
I'm already curious, girl

3221
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:26,700
If there is a picture of the day of death,

3222
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:28,940
Stop that heart

3223
02:50:28,940 --> 02:50:33,140
Let's do it. Inlencer grows.

3224
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:36,180
<i>(In 1888 on December the 4th)</i>

3225
02:50:36,180 --> 02:50:39,500

03:00:13,660 --> 03:00:15,660
<i>Keep looking at the stars</i>

3417
03:00:17,660 --> 03:00:18,660
I thought it would come

3418
03:00:18,660 --> 03:00:20,660
Speak

3419
03:00:20,660 --> 03:00:22,660
Talk to me

3420
03:00:27,660 --> 03:00:29,660
This guy

3421
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:34,660
Dead

3422
03:00:56,660 --> 03:00:58,660
Dead

3423
03:00:58,660 --> 03:01:00,660
Dead

3424
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:02,660
Dead

3425
03:01:02,660 --> 03:01:04,660
Dead

3426
03:01:04,660 --> 03:01:06,660
Dead

3427
03:01:06,660 --> 03:01:08,660
Dead

3428
03:01:08,660 --> 03:01:09,660
Dead

3429
03:01:09,660 --> 03:01:15,660
His noble life

3430
03:01:15,660 --> 03:01:19,660
<i>(We’ll stop the flow of time)</i>

3431
03:01:19,660 --> 03:01:24,660
<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

3432
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:26,660
Dead

3433
03:01:26,660 --> 03:01:28,660
Dead

3434
03:01:29,660 --> 03:01:34,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3435
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:37,660
Of course,

3436
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:41,660
Something in my eyes

3437
03:01:47,660 --> 03:01:50,660
Two in One

3438
03:01:50,660 --> 03:01:54,660
Feeling the friendship of a dog

3439
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:58,660
That's right

3440
03:01:58,660 --> 03:02:01,660
Without you

3441
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:04,660
Because you were there

3442
03:02:04,660 --> 03:02:06,660
something

3443
03:02:06,660 --> 03:02:10,660
Now I

3444
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:12,660
want

3445
03:02:12,660 --> 03:02:15,660
Find

3446
03:02:15,660 --> 03:02:18,660
To your favorite destiny

3447
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:22,660
Beautiful Mikade

3448
03:02:22,660 --> 03:02:25,660
In the stars

3449
03:02:25,660 --> 03:02:27,660
I drink

3450
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:29,660
The two

3451
03:02:29,660 --> 03:02:33,660
That fate

3452
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:35,660
It was terrible

3453
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:37,660
Another breast

3454
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:40,660
Quietly unknown

3455
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:44,660
One saw the stars

3456
03:02:44,660 --> 03:03:12,660
Tour

3457
03:03:12,660 --> 03:03:16,140
Is it polar?

3458
03:03:34,340 --> 03:03:37,120
pick up the station

3459
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:40,700
my frightenedzz

3460
03:03:40,700 --> 03:03:48,700
Speedwagon is so cool!

3461
03:03:50,700 --> 03:03:54,700
Yuishie, Yoishie!

3462
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3463
03:04:40,700 --> 03:04:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3464
03:05:10,700 --> 03:05:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3465
03:05:40,700 --> 03:05:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3466
03:06:10,700 --> 03:06:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3467
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3468
03:07:10,700 --> 03:07:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3469
03:07:40,700 --> 03:07:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3470
03:08:10,700 --> 03:08:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3471
03:08:40,700 --> 03:08:44,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3472
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3473
03:09:40,700 --> 03:09:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3474
03:10:10,700 --> 03:10:14,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3475
03:10:40,700 --> 03:10:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3476
03:11:10,700 --> 03:11:14,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3477
03:11:40,700 --> 03:11:44,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3478
03:12:10,700 --> 03:12:24,700
The best thing about this park was that the smiles of all the customers were the biggest smiles. I felt that very strongly at the park.

3479
03:12:24,700 --> 03:12:32,700
I was truly happy that such a miraculous park had been able to survive to the very end.

3480
03:12:32,700 --> 03:12:36,700
Thank you for watching.

3481
03:12:42,700 --> 03:12:46,700
Now, Mr. Kong, please.

3482
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:50,700
Thank you for watching.

3483
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:54,700
Great staff, great cast.

3484
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:58,700
Then they brought the outbreak to the theater.

3485
03:12:58,700 --> 03:13:02,700
I'm glad to meet everyone who has watched the video.

3486
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:04,700
I easily overcame the progression.

3487
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:06,700
The players were able to go home after today's academy.

3488
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:10,700
I'm happy for people.

3489
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:14,700
I let it happen.

3490
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:16,700
thank you.

3491
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:20,700
And I was struggling as a single person.

3492
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:22,700
My son!

3493
03:13:24,700 --> 03:13:26,700
That's amazing!

3494
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,700
I'm so happy!

3495
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:30,700
I'm so happy!

3496
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:34,700
It's great.

3497
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,700
It's great.

3498
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:38,700
thank you.

3499
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:42,700
Then, I received the greeting I just mentioned.

3500
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,700
Thank you for watching.

3501
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:46,700
thank you very much.

3502
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:48,700
Thank you very much.

3503
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:52,700
Everyone, please check out Fauci's Prround Funding.

3504
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:54,700
thank you.

3505
03:13:54,700 --> 03:13:56,700
thank you.

3506
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,700
thank you.

3507
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:00,700
please.

3508
03:14:00,700 --> 03:14:02,700
Everyone, you all were wonderful.

3509
03:14:02,700 --> 03:14:04,700
It was wonderful.

3510
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:06,700
See you at the theater from there.

3511
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:08,700
Thank you very much.

3512
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:14,700
He doesn't even know!

3513
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:16,700
He doesn't know either.

3514
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:18,700
He doesn't know either.

3515
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,700
He doesn't know either.

3516
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:24,700
MAMORU: It’s already over.

3517
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:26,700
yes.

3518
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:28,700
It was a huge hurdle.

3519
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:32,700
I'm not sure if I can speak well,

3520
03:14:32,700 --> 03:14:36,700
This is Elina Tendul and her character Shimis Misha.

3521
03:14:40,700 --> 03:14:44,700
Thank you very much for coming to the audience today.

3522
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:48,700
And thank you to everyone who watched the stream.

3523
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:50,700
What should I say?

3524
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:54,700
I was able to reach this great war retreat,

3525
03:14:54,700 --> 03:14:56,700
The strength of each and every cast member,

3526
03:14:56,700 --> 03:14:58,700
With the staff and

3527
03:14:58,700 --> 03:15:00,700
For supporting this work,

3528
03:15:00,700 --> 03:15:04,700
I think it's all thanks to you all.

3529
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:14,700
Please do, everyone.

3530
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:24,700
Please look at the stars, everyone.

3531
03:15:28,700 --> 03:15:30,700
So please have a great war.

3532
03:15:30,700 --> 03:15:32,700
yes.

3533
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:34,700
It's your job to burn the speeder!

3534
03:15:38,700 --> 03:15:42,700
It was my first experience and it was really difficult for me.

3535
03:15:42,700 --> 03:15:44,700
But really.

3536
03:15:44,700 --> 03:15:46,700
It was really hard, but

3537
03:15:46,700 --> 03:15:48,700
Already, somehow,

3538
03:15:48,700 --> 03:15:50,700
To get support,

3539
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:52,700
Thanks,

3540
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:54,700
It was really hard, but

3541
03:15:54,700 --> 03:15:56,700
Already, somehow,

3542
03:15:56,700 --> 03:15:58,700
To get support,

3543
03:15:58,700 --> 03:16:00,700
Like supporting them,

3544
03:16:00,700 --> 03:16:02,700
Supporting each other,

3545
03:16:02,700 --> 03:16:04,700
Those words truly mean,

3546
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,700
It just seemed to enter my body.

3547
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:08,700
It's a really wonderful place,

3548
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:10,700
Thanks to that,

3549
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:12,700
I was able to cut it thickly.

3550
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:16,700
So, I have nothing but the best to say,

3551
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:18,700
With everyone here on stage,

3552
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:20,700
As Kochi-san also said,

3553
03:16:20,700 --> 03:16:22,700
Not at all.

3554
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:24,700
Although he's not here now,

3555
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:26,700
The staff who helped me create it,

3556
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
and,

3557
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:30,700
This role,

3558
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:32,700
For five months,

3559
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:34,700
I really put it together,

3560
03:16:34,700 --> 03:16:36,700
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

3561
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:38,700
Love women,

3562
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:40,700
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

3563
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:42,700
Including everyone who loves me,

3564
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:44,700
Really,

3565
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,700
thank you very much!

3566
03:16:51,700 --> 03:16:54,700
Shirae-san...

3567
03:16:54,700 --> 03:16:56,700
Good job, Dig putting is burning well.

3568
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:59,700
I certainly understand.

3569
03:16:59,700 --> 03:17:00,700
Honchitsu,

3570
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:04,700
To Sepulija,

3571
03:17:04,700 --> 03:17:06,700
To Sepulija,

3572
03:17:06,700 --> 03:17:07,940
RPM improved office

3573
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:09,700
Wang's school committee came to the event.

3574
03:17:09,700 --> 03:17:10,700
Thank you for your continued support.

3575
03:17:10,700 --> 03:17:12,700
Thank you very much.

3576
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:15,700
Really,

3577
03:17:15,700 --> 03:17:17,700
The first thought is,

3578
03:17:17,700 --> 03:17:20,700
There were a lot of different things that happened.

3579
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:23,700
The two of them, Shotaro, and now, here

3580
03:17:23,700 --> 03:17:26,700
The one who finished the tree, and another Teperi,

3581
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:30,700
Hiro-kun and I accomplished so much on our own.

3582
03:17:30,700 --> 03:17:33,700
Mom, this company is a one-lens camera for people.

3583
03:17:33,700 --> 03:17:36,700
With the determination to align

3584
03:17:36,700 --> 03:17:38,700
I came here with the aim of becoming a teacher of Wang's music.

3585
03:17:38,700 --> 03:17:41,700
Really, without anyone calling

3586
03:17:41,700 --> 03:17:43,700
Of course, I'm really grateful that I've come this far.

3587
03:17:43,700 --> 03:17:46,700
Medical support from staff

3588
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:48,700
It is the result of your efforts.

3589
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:50,700
Every single stage, really

3590
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:52,700
I just want to omit it.

3591
03:17:52,700 --> 03:17:53,700
Every single stage, really

3592
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:56,700
The applause of the Baraline and 5000 yen are us

3593
03:17:56,700 --> 03:17:58,700
Now the cast is

3594
03:17:58,700 --> 03:18:00,700
The truth is, it's your Hamon energy.

3595
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:02,700
How much courage it gave us

3596
03:18:02,700 --> 03:18:05,700
I think that's what we really feel.

3597
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:09,700
I was really close to Hantoshi and Okabetsu right now.

3598
03:18:09,700 --> 03:18:12,700
It really is like a family

3599
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:15,700
It means that today will be a valley from tomorrow onwards.

3600
03:18:15,700 --> 03:18:17,700
Hey hey

3601
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:19,700
Annie

3602
03:18:19,700 --> 03:18:23,700
A little Syriaria please

3603
03:18:23,700 --> 03:18:25,700
Just a little bit

3604
03:18:25,700 --> 03:18:27,700
I feel lonely though

3605
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:29,700
I really love myself

3606
03:18:29,700 --> 03:18:30,700
This woman's world

3607
03:18:30,700 --> 03:18:32,700
And with these beloved members

3608
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:34,700
In this theater

3609
03:18:34,700 --> 03:18:36,700
Being able to breathe the same air

3610
03:18:36,700 --> 03:18:38,700
That's right.

3611
03:18:38,700 --> 03:18:41,700
The one who touched everyone's hearts was

3612
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:47,700
I have become a treasure too

3613
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:49,700
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

3614
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:51,700
Thank you so much everyone

3615
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:53,700
thank you

3616
03:18:53,700 --> 03:18:55,700
It will end again

3617
03:18:55,700 --> 03:18:57,700
Blatzer

3618
03:19:01,700 --> 03:19:03,700
Please watch

3619
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:09,700
I changed my boss's environment.

3620
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:10,700
Another ironworker

3621
03:19:10,700 --> 03:19:12,700
Thank you for today

3622
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:17,700
It's totally free

3623
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:19,700
So many

3624
03:19:19,700 --> 03:19:22,700
As you have written earlier,

3625
03:19:22,700 --> 03:19:24,700
Right from here on

3626
03:19:24,700 --> 03:19:26,700
As in the title above

3627
03:19:26,700 --> 03:19:29,700
It was a strange adventure.

3628
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:34,700
There are so many people like you.

3629
03:19:34,700 --> 03:19:35,700
Only the curtain of Hara

3630
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:37,700
Born at the Imperial Theatre

3631
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:39,700
The Imperial Theatre

3632
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:41,700
The current theater is closing.

3633
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:43,700
As a final review

3634
03:19:43,700 --> 03:19:45,700
By producing

3635
03:19:45,700 --> 03:19:47,700
Not Minami

3636
03:19:47,700 --> 03:19:49,700
Memories

3637
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:51,700
Participated

3638
03:19:51,700 --> 03:19:53,700
My friends are cast members here.

3639
03:19:53,700 --> 03:19:55,700
It is staff

3640
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:57,700
And the original author

3641
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:59,700
The main cast members

3642
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,700
And here are the books.

3643
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,700
After five years of work

3644
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:05,700
Apparently it was rewritten 17 times.

3645
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,700
It was in this flow that I was born.

3646
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:09,700
This work

3647
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:11,700
Being accepted by everyone like this

3648
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:12,700
Like this

3649
03:20:12,700 --> 03:20:13,700
Many musicals

3650
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:15,700
We have some works from overseas.

3651
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:16,700
Such works are

3652
03:20:16,700 --> 03:20:17,700
Zahiozic Zero is

3653
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:19,700
On Broadway and in the West End

3654
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:21,700
That's what we're here for

3655
03:20:21,700 --> 03:20:22,700
In books

3656
03:20:22,700 --> 03:20:24,700
While making large replicas

3657
03:20:24,700 --> 03:20:26,700
Let's fight

3658
03:20:26,700 --> 03:20:27,700
Japanese style

3659
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:29,700
We provide information.

3660
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:30,700
This work is

3661
03:20:30,700 --> 03:20:31,700
What you all saw

3662
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:32,700
Exactly

3663
03:20:32,700 --> 03:20:34,700
From zero to one

3664
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:35,700
Became Zahiozic

3665
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:37,700
I think it's a work of art.

3666
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,700
This work

3667
03:20:38,700 --> 03:20:39,700
Someday again

3668
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,700
Inherited

3669
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:43,700
It may be a big performance,

3670
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:45,700
This Zahiozik

3671
03:20:45,700 --> 03:20:46,700
I was at Zero 1

3672
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:47,700
The friends here

3673
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:48,700
Really I

3674
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,700
It's just for the time being.

3675
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:51,700
Zayn

3676
03:20:51,700 --> 03:20:54,700
I feel like a son or daughter to you.

3677
03:20:54,700 --> 03:21:00,700
Only one person was different

3678
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:03,700
Since they share the same father

3679
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:06,700
One as a father

3680
03:21:06,700 --> 03:21:08,700
Mud and Stars

3681
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:09,700
University

3682
03:21:09,700 --> 03:21:10,700
A work ticket

3683
03:21:10,700 --> 03:21:11,700
As a friend

3684
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:12,700
from now on

3685
03:21:12,700 --> 03:21:13,700
At the Shibutoku Musical

3686
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:15,700
I want to survive

3687
03:21:20,700 --> 03:21:21,700
Truly amazing

3688
03:21:21,700 --> 03:21:23,700
Two sons

3689
03:21:23,700 --> 03:21:24,700
Like this

3690
03:21:24,700 --> 03:21:26,700
I can have it

3691
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:27,700
A little bit today

3692
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:28,700
You might be watching from anywhere

3693
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:29,700
Also serving

3694
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:30,700
As a son

3695
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:32,700
Nice to meet you

3696
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:33,700
Truly amazing

3697
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:34,700
Yesterday

3698
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:35,700
As a father

3699
03:21:35,700 --> 03:21:36,700
I was able to participate

3700
03:21:36,700 --> 03:21:37,700
Hello everyone

3701
03:21:37,700 --> 03:21:39,700
If you have any worries

3702
03:21:39,700 --> 03:21:40,700
Finally

3703
03:21:40,700 --> 03:21:41,700
What is it?

3704
03:21:41,700 --> 03:21:42,700
Within myself

3705
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:44,700
It's all connected

3706
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:46,700
That it all has meaning

3707
03:21:46,700 --> 03:21:47,700
a little bit

3708
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:48,700
If you think so

3709
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:49,700
surely

3710
03:21:49,700 --> 03:21:50,700
Beyond that

3711
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:51,700
There is light

3712
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:52,700
There are stars

3713
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:53,700
If you think so

3714
03:21:53,700 --> 03:21:55,700
I think it's that kind of work.

3715
03:21:55,700 --> 03:21:56,700
thank you

3716
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:05,700
Well then

3717
03:22:05,700 --> 03:22:06,700
I will do my best

3718
03:22:16,700 --> 03:22:18,700
Where should I start?

3719
03:22:18,700 --> 03:22:19,700
Already

3720
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:26,700
But anyway

3721
03:22:32,700 --> 03:22:34,700
I'm glad we met

3722
03:22:34,700 --> 03:22:36,700
Hotz

3723
03:22:45,700 --> 03:22:46,700
We

3724
03:22:46,700 --> 03:22:47,700
Entertainment and

3725
03:22:47,700 --> 03:22:49,700
I'm trying not to

3726
03:22:51,700 --> 03:22:52,700
Sometimes after all

3727
03:22:52,700 --> 03:22:53,700
There are times when it's difficult

3728
03:23:00,700 --> 03:23:01,700
There are times when it's scary

3729
03:23:01,700 --> 03:23:03,700
but

3730
03:23:03,700 --> 03:23:05,700
The Minister just said

3731
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:06,700
As you said

3732
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:07,700
Something

3733
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:08,700
In the purely literal sense

3734
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:10,700
Don't do it right away

3735
03:23:12,700 --> 03:23:13,700
In the truest sense

3736
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:14,700
Do it now

3737
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:16,700
That's what it means

3738
03:23:18,700 --> 03:23:19,700
I am this

3739
03:23:19,700 --> 03:23:21,700
I felt it at Campari.

3740
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:23,700
of course

3741
03:23:28,700 --> 03:23:30,700
A lot of things happened

3742
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:31,700
Something like that

3743
03:23:33,700 --> 03:23:35,700
Only in those words

3744
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:37,700
I might not be able to tell you right now, but

3745
03:23:38,700 --> 03:23:40,700
And more

3746
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:41,700
I

3747
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:42,700
now

3748
03:23:45,700 --> 03:23:46,700
As a treasure

3749
03:23:46,700 --> 03:23:48,700
I was able to have

3750
03:23:48,700 --> 03:23:49,700
Above all

3751
03:23:49,700 --> 03:23:50,700
It

3752
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:51,700
so

3753
03:23:53,700 --> 03:23:54,700
lots of

3754
03:23:56,700 --> 03:23:58,700
To humans

3755
03:24:04,700 --> 03:24:06,700
That you can enjoy it

3756
03:24:06,700 --> 03:24:07,700
After all, it's ours

3757
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:09,700
It's the happiest thing

3758
03:24:09,700 --> 03:24:10,700
It

3759
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:12,700
With this member

3760
03:24:12,700 --> 03:24:14,700
It can be closed on paper

3761
03:24:14,700 --> 03:24:16,700
I am happy

3762
03:24:17,700 --> 03:24:18,700
Women

3763
03:24:18,700 --> 03:24:20,700
Giant player fun

3764
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:22,700
I welcomed

3765
03:24:24,700 --> 03:24:25,700
My father just now

3766
03:24:25,700 --> 03:24:27,700
As you said

3767
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:29,700
We will continue to do so

3768
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:31,700
Look forward

3769
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,700
Surely soon

3770
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:34,700
Each on their own path

3771
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:35,700
Various expressions

3772
03:24:37,700 --> 03:24:39,700
I think I'll pursue it

3773
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:41,700
Not yet

3774
03:24:42,700 --> 03:24:44,700
It will be useful

3775
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:48,700
Dad too

3776
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:55,700
Let's definitely meet again

3777
03:24:55,700 --> 03:24:56,700
and

3778
03:24:57,700 --> 03:24:58,700
Also this woman

3779
03:24:58,700 --> 03:25:00,700
I think it would be a good story if we could meet.

3780
03:25:03,700 --> 03:25:05,700
It's all connected

3781
03:25:08,700 --> 03:25:10,700
I dream of such a day

3782
03:25:10,700 --> 03:25:11,700
Today is really

3783
03:25:11,700 --> 03:25:12,700
To everyone

3784
03:25:12,700 --> 03:25:13,700
I want to express my gratitude

3785
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:14,700
everyone

3786
03:25:14,700 --> 03:25:15,700
thank you

3787
03:25:24,700 --> 03:25:26,700
amazing

3788
03:25:26,700 --> 03:25:27,700
I'll say something good.

3789
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:36,700
I think Bappy will decide.

3790
03:25:37,700 --> 03:25:38,700
thank you

3791
03:25:39,700 --> 03:25:40,700
Woman

3792
03:25:40,700 --> 03:25:41,700
I pushed the woman down.

3793
03:25:41,700 --> 03:25:42,700
This is Arisa Shotaro

3794
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:47,700
everyone

3795
03:25:47,700 --> 03:25:48,700
Really

3796
03:25:49,700 --> 03:25:51,700
Those who noticed

3797
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:52,700
I don't know, but

3798
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:54,700
I

3799
03:25:55,700 --> 03:25:56,700
Because I'm this kind of person

3800
03:25:57,700 --> 03:25:58,700
Even if I stand in the middle

3801
03:25:58,700 --> 03:26:00,700
After all, everyone

3802
03:26:00,700 --> 03:26:01,700
Many people

3803
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:03,700
For holding me and supporting me

3804
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:04,700
already

3805
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:06,700
Warm

3806
03:26:06,700 --> 03:26:08,700
Someone like my older brother

3807
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:09,700
He was already a family man

3808
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:10,700
People like

3809
03:26:10,700 --> 03:26:11,700
Because that's fine for you

3810
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:13,700
You can go with that humanity

3811
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:14,700
Just those words are enough

3812
03:26:14,700 --> 03:26:16,700
I really have come this far

3813
03:26:16,700 --> 03:26:18,700
But still

3814
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:20,700
When I look around,

3815
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:22,700
After all, this time everyone

3816
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:24,700
After all

3817
03:26:24,700 --> 03:26:26,700
Cress

3818
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:28,700
I've seen your face after all

3819
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:29,700
Really everyone

3820
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,700
too

3821
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:32,700
After all, the curtain won't open

3822
03:26:32,700 --> 03:26:35,700
There were many things that caused me anxiety.

3823
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:36,700
I think there is.

3824
03:26:36,700 --> 03:26:37,700
That voice also reached me

3825
03:26:37,700 --> 03:26:39,700
It arrived directly after all

3826
03:26:39,700 --> 03:26:42,700
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3827
03:26:43,700 --> 03:26:44,700
What's going on?

3828
03:26:44,700 --> 03:26:46,700
Ride and enjoy

3829
03:26:46,700 --> 03:26:47,700
There are various messages

3830
03:26:47,700 --> 03:26:49,700
I saw the power of seeing.

3831
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:50,700
just

3832
03:26:50,700 --> 03:26:52,700
I

3833
03:26:53,700 --> 03:26:55,700
I really believe in everyone

3834
03:26:56,700 --> 03:26:57,700
I'm working hard here

3835
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:58,700
Because I've been watching everyone

3836
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:02,700
Watch it.

3837
03:27:02,700 --> 03:27:03,700
Feelings

3838
03:27:04,700 --> 03:27:06,700
I just want you to wear it

3839
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:08,700
That's really the only feeling

3840
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:10,700
Not

3841
03:27:10,700 --> 03:27:11,700
Together

3842
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:13,200
There are so many different

3843
03:27:13,200 --> 03:27:14,700
Overcoming a big wall

3844
03:27:14,700 --> 03:27:15,700
already

3845
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:17,700
Even if the conversation doesn't change

3846
03:27:17,700 --> 03:27:18,700
Invisible

3847
03:27:18,700 --> 03:27:20,700
It's a bond

3848
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:21,700
That's already the case

3849
03:27:21,700 --> 03:27:22,700
Don don don don

3850
03:27:22,700 --> 03:27:24,700
That means we're connected

3851
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:26,700
I've been feeling this trend for a long time now

3852
03:27:27,700 --> 03:27:28,700
After all

3853
03:27:28,700 --> 03:27:29,700
Makuha is open

3854
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:31,700
Jonah Joshi's

3855
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:33,700
What is the other Yuya-san?

3856
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:35,700
Really

3857
03:27:35,700 --> 03:27:38,700
We've talked about a lot of things up until today

3858
03:27:38,700 --> 03:27:40,700
Yesterday's Yuya's war loss

3859
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:42,700
Watching Hiro's wartime success

3860
03:27:42,700 --> 03:27:44,700
After all,

3861
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:46,700
There was today

3862
03:27:47,700 --> 03:27:48,700
One more

3863
03:27:48,700 --> 03:27:51,700
I feel like I've really completed it.

3864
03:27:51,700 --> 03:27:53,700
I got into the mood.

3865
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:56,700
I've seen some really amazing things

3866
03:27:56,700 --> 03:27:57,700
on second thoughts

3867
03:27:57,700 --> 03:27:58,700
I'm glad I worked hard

3868
03:27:58,700 --> 03:27:59,700
Really already

3869
03:27:59,700 --> 03:28:01,700
As of yesterday, I felt

3870
03:28:01,700 --> 03:28:02,700
So today, everyone

3871
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:03,700
so

3872
03:28:03,700 --> 03:28:05,700
I can see that face in Chi-up

3873
03:28:05,700 --> 03:28:07,700
Really I

3874
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:09,700
With a heartfelt joy

3875
03:28:09,700 --> 03:28:10,700
There are lots

3876
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:12,700
As it was at the beginning

3877
03:28:12,700 --> 03:28:13,700
I

3878
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:16,700
I think it's a historic evolution.

3879
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:17,700
To the world

3880
03:28:17,700 --> 03:28:18,700
Really already

3881
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:20,700
We all worked hard to create it

3882
03:28:20,700 --> 03:28:21,700
already

3883
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,700
This guy

3884
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:24,700
This guy gave it to me in the field.

3885
03:28:24,700 --> 03:28:25,700
Together

3886
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:26,700
I want to keep up

3887
03:28:26,700 --> 03:28:27,700
already

3888
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:28,700
try as hard as one can

3889
03:28:28,700 --> 03:28:29,700
Climb, climb, climb, climb up the mountain

3890
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:31,700
today

3891
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:32,700
Really

3892
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:34,700
I think I was able to make everyone happy.

3893
03:28:34,700 --> 03:28:35,700
Thank you so much

3894
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:47,700
Me too

3895
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:48,700
Really

3896
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:50,700
I spoke without thinking

3897
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:51,700
Maybe

3898
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:52,700
no

3899
03:28:52,700 --> 03:28:53,700
That's not true

3900
03:28:53,700 --> 03:28:56,700
Some people may think that

3901
03:28:56,700 --> 03:28:58,700
This is definitely

3902
03:28:58,700 --> 03:28:59,700
already

3903
03:28:59,700 --> 03:29:00,700
It's my feelings

3904
03:29:00,700 --> 03:29:02,700
Campari's feelings

3905
03:29:02,700 --> 03:29:03,700
I

3906
03:29:03,700 --> 03:29:04,700
today

3907
03:29:04,700 --> 03:29:06,700
It may be a mistake

3908
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:08,700
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3909
03:29:17,700 --> 03:29:19,700
It's okay to think that

3910
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:23,700
Me too

3911
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:28,700
Me too

3912
03:29:28,700 --> 03:29:35,700
where

3913
03:29:35,700 --> 03:29:39,700
Me too

3914
03:29:42,700 --> 03:29:44,700
Everyone did their best.

3915
03:29:45,700 --> 03:29:48,700
everyone

3916
03:29:48,700 --> 03:29:50,700
everyone

3917
03:29:50,700 --> 03:29:52,700
everyone

3918
03:29:52,700 --> 03:29:54,700
thank you

3919
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:09,700
I

3920
03:30:09,700 --> 03:30:11,700
To dry this

3921
03:30:11,700 --> 03:30:13,700
Also

3922
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:29,700
I hope that I will be able to meet you all in person soon. I also hope that this work will continue to remain not only in Japan, but all over the world.

3923
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:37,700
I want to teach with big dreams.

3924
03:30:38,700 --> 03:30:40,700
Thank you very much.

3925
03:30:46,700 --> 03:30:51,700
So, I hope to finish it again soon, and thank you for watching today.

3926
03:31:07,700 --> 03:31:11,700
Thank you for watching.

3927
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:41,700
Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

3936
03:35:32,700 --> 03:35:35,700
Everyone, everyone and a little bit of everyone.

3937
03:35:38,700 --> 03:35:41,700
Because there are a lot of things going on.

3938
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:48,700
Thank you everyone!

3939
03:35:49,700 --> 03:35:51,700
