00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:48,000
hard

2
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is also on screen and can be spoken about.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's okay. It's okay.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You have been chosen.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, you guys.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You have been chosen.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I decided it was trustworthy.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If something should
happen to me, I—

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This record must be kept.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Back to the story.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, let's get back to the topic.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Medicine, government studies, high school studies, etc.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And created our branches around the world...

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And created our branches around the world...

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please listen carefully.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I founded this foundation here in the United States.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And created our branches around the world...

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That secret is...

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The Stone Mask.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The mood is,

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The mood is,

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The mood is,

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The mood is,

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It all began in the 13th century.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It all began in the 13th century.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It all started with the 16th generation.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
About once in Afteka.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Dear Osamu,

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dear Osamu,

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dear Osamu,

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dear Osamu,

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Blessed man,

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>The power in this hand</i>

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When will it be time to breathe history?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Widespread

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

59
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,000
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

It's Ikeame

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I won't leave again

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I have to apologize for doing it

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll finish you up, Ikeri

67
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Today is

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm sleepy

69
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
-Wait!

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

72
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Everyone's still gathered

73
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
It's coming

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
The first person will go

75
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Yahoo!

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Hurry, hurry

79
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Wooooooooooooo!

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm sorry for not being friendly with you

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,940
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,940
What the—

85
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,420
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh, it's in this box. It's the next best thing.

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,700
Don’t need that!

88
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

89
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,600
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

90
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,900
The valuables are gone, Yuriya and I are scared

91
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

92
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Look, find it

93
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Just one night

94
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,300
No thanks

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,900
You... Did you rescue us...?

96
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
She croa—

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,200
Did you buy it?

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,140
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,120
So this too is fate...

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
What about Red?

103
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
Morning

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,380
I helped

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,180
Is this also a dream?

106
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,060
Race saved my life

107
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,260

I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

111
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,780
Ah, Dario, beat Brando!

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,140
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

124
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,020

00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Nice!

186
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Makusu!

187
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
ah!

188
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
oh!

189
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
What should we do?

190
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
oh!

191
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Don’t let this brat go!

192
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,240
Don’t let this brat go!

193
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,740
Go!

194
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
nice!

195
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Oi!

196
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
This idiot

197
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
oh!

198
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
At this level, the arrow of life is returned!

199
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

200
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,740
White mountain.

201
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,820
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

202
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,280
I don't want that to happen!

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
What is it, Father?

204
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,200
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh no!

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,100
Oh no!

207
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
Nah, I don’t need that.

208
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh no!

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
What's wrong?

210
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,300
a

211
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,040
a

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Medicine

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,880
Oh no

216
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,140
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,240
I know

218
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
Hey

219
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,580
Since I disappeared as a new

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
Take this.

221
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,500
Take this.

222
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,740
Take this.

223
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,500
Oh, dear dear dear dear

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,180
And he owes me one.

225
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,300
He’s a noble.

226
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
He’s a noble.

227
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,460
And he owes me one.

228
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,260
Okay?

229
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,660
When I die, send him that letter.

230
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Go to him.

231
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,620
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

232
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

233
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,140
Father...

234
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,100
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
Listen up...

236
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,340
<i>Now</i> you start acting like a parent?!

237
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,740
Dio!

238
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,900
You’re a smart boy.

239
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,260
Seriously to no one

240
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,900
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

241
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Dio

242
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,340
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

243
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,540
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

244
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,780
Stolen

245
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,020
Keep going

246
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,540
That's right

247
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,740
Unbeatable

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,460
I feel nauseous

249
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,900
It's hell now

250
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,500
Hakie wo Moyoko

251
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

252
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,900
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

253
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,260
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

254
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,620
Nedio

255
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,100
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

256
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,220
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

257
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,820
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

258
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,060
openly

259
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,140
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

260
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,140
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

261
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,460
What a star

262
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,300
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

263
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,980
<i>Is it blue?</i>

264
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,500
It happened

265
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:30,900
Blowing in my ears

266
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,940
The worst father

267
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,500
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

268
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,660
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

269
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,940
I was already running and dying

270
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,020
Let's receive Issan now

271
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,580
Use all

272
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:07,140
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

273
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:13,220
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

274
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,380
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

275
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,300
It happened

276
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,140
You have it

277
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:33,620
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

278
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,300
That's it.

279
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,320
Usually

280
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,420
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

281
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,700
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

282
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

283
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
My father’s a real doctor!

284
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!

285
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

286
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Stop right there!

287
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,300
What are you doing?! Take this!

288
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
What are you doing?! Take this!

289
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,300
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

290
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?

291
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It's Jouster Keljouna.

292
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
More copy and copy parts under the eyes.

293
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,300
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

294
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,300
It's Kanemochiki Day for both of us!

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Eh?!

296
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Let’s go already! Shit!

297
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Uh... Are you alright?

298
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I did this because I wanted to.

299
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
I did this because I wanted to.

300
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,300
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.

301
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

302
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

303
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,300
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

304
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Someday you'll be able to win.

305
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Oh, wait!

306
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Ah, wait a minute!

307
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Jona-san Jowstar.

308
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay, let's go!

309
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
You must be Dio Brando!

310
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,300
And you’re...

311
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
You're Diopransola!

312
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,300
That's you, Jona-san Jouster.

313
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Everyone calls her Chocho.

314
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

315
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Danny!

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Let's go.

317
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

318
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
friend?

319
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Lord Joestar!

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
What are you doing?

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Gyul-san!

322
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

323
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Starting today, you are part of our family.

324
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

325
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

326
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

327
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

328
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,300
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

329
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Jowstar, thank you for your service today.

330
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
BLADDOG!

331
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
-He came at me so suddenly.

332
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
police?

333
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Is something wrong?

334
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

335
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,300
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

336
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
That was sudden!

337
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

338
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

339
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,300
He's quite friendly, but it was great that he surprised you.

340
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Make sure to get along with each other.

341
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

342
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Nice to have met you!

343
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Please get along well with each other.

344
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Now, let me show you to your room.

345
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
BLADDOG!

346
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
JoJo!

347
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Don’t touch my bag!

348
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
JoJo!

349
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

350
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

351
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm driving.

352
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

353
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,300
What are you two doing?

354
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Listen, JoJo.

355
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,300
And one more thing—

356
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,300
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I hate dogs.

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,300
I hate dogs.

359
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
One more thing.

360
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I hate dogs.

361
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

362
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

363
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

364
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Thus, the two proofs met and the two players began.

365
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Hitaka Jojo.

366
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Dioc.

367
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Okay?

368
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,380
I aye raa

369
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

370
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Still no good, get it on your hands.

371
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

372
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,660
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

373
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Wait and see next time

374
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,660
No matter what, I want to do it to you

375
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Being reborn and illuminating

376
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,660
It’s just because I love reading so much!

377
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

378
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
This is the sixth time

379
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,660
All of the answers are correct.

380
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

381
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
This much

382
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,660
It's still not easy to play,

383
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Ikane

384
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
We are

385
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Here as a high memory

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
real

387
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Check it out

388
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,660
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

389
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Pesh thing

390
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I almost believe

391
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

392
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Nothing is always

393
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
Without passing by the beauty

394
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,660
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

395
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

396
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
To be loved

397
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Really high

398
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Azukasa

399
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
a little bit

400
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
nevertheless

401
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
Do you believe it?

402
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Look at it

403
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
I'll tell you

404
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Perfect supporter

405
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Shockley, too.

406
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Aventine

407
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
That's it

408
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Riwo

409
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I don't see it

410
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
I

411
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Embarrassing

412
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
You

413
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,660
I was spoiled

414
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Such

415
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
My mother gave it to me.

416
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
always

417
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Correct the festival

418
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Ikane

419
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
We are

420
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Were you born?

421
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
As a memory

422
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Philosophy

423
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
However,

424
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
The exit

425
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Always in mind

426
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
And so she gave them this condition:

427
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
There are two models

428
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
One day

429
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Their master

430
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
By the enemy

431
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Captive

432
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
It became

433
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Here is my question for you:

434
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Huge power

435
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
have

436
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
The two models

437
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
fear

438
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
I put forward the conditions

439
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Instead

440
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
You guys

441
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Once menarche occurs

442
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

443
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Life is

444
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,660
To try to guarantee

445
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
where

446
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

447
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

448
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
yes

449
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
To save my master

450
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
What do you think?

451
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Captive

452
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
The stars?

453
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
The stars?

454
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Or the mud?

455
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Railway City

456
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
First

457
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
What I'm looking at

458
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Or the mud?

459
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Or the mud?

460
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Or

461
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

462
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Shine

463
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
want

464
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
I wonder

465
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
What’s your reasoning?

466
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
think

467
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I wanted

468
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Draw?

469
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I

470
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Draw

471
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I think...

472
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
I think...

473
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Why

474
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
I think...

475
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
I think...

476
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
They held onto their honour!

477
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
They held onto their honour!

478
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Death unexpectedly

479
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,660
They were looking at the stars!

480
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
If I die,

481
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
They held onto their honour!

482
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
So what!

483
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
So what!

484
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
So what!

485
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Even if you put down the work

486
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Alive

487
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Something

488
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Nasaneba and

489
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
But they—

490
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
I

491
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

492
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
But they—

493
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

494
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
But they—

495
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
It's a kiss

496
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
In history

497
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
What they saw was the mud!

498
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
So

499
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
So

500
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
How did you live?

501
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
How it happened

502
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Cherish it

503
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

504
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
They

505
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Listen!

506
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
Nothing in hand

507
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Not included

508
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Listen!

509
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
解鋼

510
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Helplessness

511
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
They

512
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
What I saw

513
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
It's a draw

514
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
They

515
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Teaching

516
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Alive

517
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
What

518
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
I—

519
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
That’s enough, you two.

520
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

521
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
That’s enough, you two.

522
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

523
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
That’s enough, you two.

524
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
you

525
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
It's a rule

526
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

527
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
Bear in mind—

528
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
I'm alive

529
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,660
If so

530
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
To fulfill that responsibility

531
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Alive

532
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
What to do

533
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Shouldn't you think about it?

534
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
I

535
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Both of them

536
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
That far

537
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

538
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

539
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
Is that okay?

540
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
People

541
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

542
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,660
live

543
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,660
So

544
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Reach out

545
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
What you can see is

546
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Do you want

547
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Or

548
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Which one

549
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
Both

550
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,660
To the correct answer

551
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Lyrics

552
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

553
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

554
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
moreover

555
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,660
I came with you

556
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Eskikar

557
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>

558
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
a lot

559
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
<i>The opening bell rings</i>

560
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>

Shukyo

562
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!

563
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
yes

564
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,660
Basso

565
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Everyone

That far

567
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,660
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!

568
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
That's how we deal with each other

569
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,660
Who

570
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
Decide who is the king

571
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Return

572
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
The conch sounds

Today's Challenge

574
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
So

575
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660

621
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,660
1

622
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
What is this move!

623
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
What is this move!

624
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
I’ve never seen it before!

625
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
With this rail, it keeps coming out!

626
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
It's Hong!

627
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
It's Feeket!

628
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Yay!

629
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Nodknocky!

630
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,660
That’s a hit to the face!

631
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,660
That’s a hit to the face!

632
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Ah...

633
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
Our king! Our king!

634
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,660
My eye!

635
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,660
My eye!

636
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Hey, how are you?

637
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
D ص PAR!

638
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Ichikowa

639
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Everyone! Everyone!

640
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My finger seems to have landed in his eye.

641
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,360
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

642
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,740
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

643
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,220
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

644
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,540
So why don't you stop!

645
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,900
Hubber, everyone!

646
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:38,660
For some reason, Dio is trying to get me to fall for him.

647
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,660
I feel like I'm being trusted more and more

648
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,660
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

649
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,660
I'm full of anxiety

650
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,660
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

651
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,660
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

652
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,660
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

653
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Thank you for being by my side

654
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:30,660
If I had a mother, would it be like this?

655
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Is this how you loved me?

656
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

657
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:59,660
My half

658
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Has it caught your fancy?

659
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.

660
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,660
It’s alright.

661
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Are you curious?

662
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,660
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

663
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
I don't care

664
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,660
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

665
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Mekishiko

666
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
When girls were just born

667
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,660
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

668
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,660
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

669
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,660
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

670
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Are you interested?

671
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Aie, nothing in particular

672
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,660
that

673
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,660
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

674
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Danny's attitude towards women

675
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,660
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.

676
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Friendship Is it a dog?

677
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

678
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,660
I won it.

679
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

680
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

681
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
But one day

682
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,660
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

683
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

684
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

685
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,660
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

686
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,660
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

687
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

688
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

689
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,660
Is that so?

690
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Danny's spirited actions

691
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
A young woman

692
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Danny's feelings

693
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,660
The two met once more!

694
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Since then they

695
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,660
The two met once more!

696
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

697
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Dangaso too

698
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
ah

699
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
it was

700
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Believe

701
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Butterfly

702
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
The two resumed

703
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
love

704
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

705
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
It’s nothing interesting.

706
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
What are you hiding?

707
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I won’t laugh.

708
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Danny

709
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Be well behaved

710
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,660
You eat in separate scenes

711
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,660
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>

712
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
no

713
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Nothing

714
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
Why hide it?

715
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

716
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
You'll laugh

717
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I won't laugh

718
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>

719
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

720
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Oh!

Just call

725
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Relax

726
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,660
What kind of music

727
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
The sound

728
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

729
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,660
What's going well

730
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
already

731
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Laugh like that

732
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Morning or quite

733
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
Bab

734
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,660

<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

739
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,660
The wind is a little sweet

740
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660

742
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm short of words

743
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
<i>Scoundrel!</i>

744
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Overflowing

745
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,660
forever

746
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
One word

747
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
I'm happy

748
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

749
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
<i>Your hand,</i>

750

People who can't hear

I don't know

755
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,660
I'm being asked by you

756
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Put on Jariun

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,660
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

My hands

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,660
Touching

761
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,660
be confused

762
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Towards tomorrow

763
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
It’s already this late!

764
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,660
It’s already this late!

765
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Erina!

766
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Erina!

767
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
surely

768
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
compete

769
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Hawatsu

770
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Preconceived notions

771
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>

772
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Because a customer is coming today

773
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
I have to hurry back

774
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Elina

775
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
see you tomorrow

776
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Huh, okay?

777
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Huh

778
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,660
compete

779
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Suyoku

780
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
you

781
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
What do you...

782
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Isn't that right?

783
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,660
What do you...

784
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Ugh

785
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Ugh

786
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Ugh

787
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Ugh

788
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,660
It's Erina Pendleton.

789
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Today is

790
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
With my superior

791
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
They were just playing

792
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
that

793
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
something

794
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
wall

795
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Ugh

796
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Ugh

797
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Ugh

798
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Ugh

799
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Ugh

800
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
Ugh

801
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Ugh

802
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Ugh

803
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Ugh

804
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Ugh

805
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Ugh

806
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Ugh

807
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Ugh

808
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Ugh

809
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Udo Yaa

810
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
It was me, Dio!

811
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Cling

812
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
today

813
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
What can't be done on broken ground

814
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Do a transformation and get out

815
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
I can see it locked there

816
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,660
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

817
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Not yet

818
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
My first partner is not Chojo

819
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
<i>Dio...</i>

820
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,660
If it's ratey, what does that mean?

821
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,660
Get up, bitch!

822
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,660
This guy!

823
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!

824
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,660
What’re you sleeping for?

825
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
Wow!

826
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
What's going on?

827
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

828
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Who is responsible for Peter's food shortage?

829
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Namaruka

830
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
yes

831
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Please, you’ve got to get well!

832
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Please, you’ve got to get well!

833
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,660
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

834
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

835
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,660
Please give me an illustration that doesn't look like a kaza.

836
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!

837
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,520
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

838
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,640
Izawa Hiamatress

839
00:41:45,640 --> 00:42:07,860
宙zech

840
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,860
You go buy some alcohol

841
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Already money

842
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Eni

843
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
The alcoholic beverages have arrived.

844
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,860
You and I are different!

845
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,860
at least

846
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Eat money to buy medicine

847
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Your mouth is big

848
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
How long will I remain?

849
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
I thought he was shy, but

850
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Magara

851
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Crack

852
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Well, my breasts are always twisted and swaying.

853
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
I noticed it too early and stepped on it

854
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Yes, it's Joes.

855
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
If you see a hand

856
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
Follow

857
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
I am

858
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
With you

859
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Haa

860
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Haa

861
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
Haa

862
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
Haa

863
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Haa

864
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,860
Haa

865
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Haa

866
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Haa

867
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Haa

868
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

869
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,860
Hurt her

870
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
Haa

871
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

872
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
<i>So you’ve heard? What I
did to your beloved Erina?</i>

873
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Why?

874
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Oh

875
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Haa

876
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,860
-You’ve disgraced her!

877
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Much more than me

878
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,860
I respect that.

879
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Only in my heart

880
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
One thing is for sure

881
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,860
There is something burning

882
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
Oh no

883
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,860
Haa

884
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Many people's names

885
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,860
Easy to wear

886
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,860
A small person

887
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
I heard that

888
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
My love

889
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,860
you

890
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Kyusana

891
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm the one

892
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,860
I don't care

893
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,860
nine

894
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,860
Haa

895
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Haa

896
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
Haa

897
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,860
Stand up to it

898
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
No shoulders

899
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,860
this

900
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
It feels so good!

901
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Oh

902
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
Emotions

903
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,860
Dominate

904
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,860
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

905
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
Slippery Heart

906
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,860
Her name

907
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,860
Get it back

908
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Oh no

909
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Generation rate

910
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Battle

911
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

912
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
Oh no

913
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
Haa

914
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,860
you

915
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,860
I miss you

916
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Get to know

917
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,860
That's a good impression.

918
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
Haa

919
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
Haa

920
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,860
Haa

921
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Haa

922
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Haa

923
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Haa

924
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Haa

925
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

926
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
You

927
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

928
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Only

929
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Oh no

930
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
You

931
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
You

932
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,860
Until Naku

933
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

934
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,860
Lost

935
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,860
Don't bend

936
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,860
Haa

937
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,860
Haa

938
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Haa

939
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,860
Haa

940
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,860
often

941
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,860
too

942
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,860
To me

943
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Bukase

944
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
surely

945
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,860
Konoha

946
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Better

947
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,860
Like this

948
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,860
Like winning

949
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,860
Cheap

950
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
This me

951
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,860
this

952
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,860
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

953
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Like this

954
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Like winning

955
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,860
Cheap

956
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,860
This me

957
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
This suits you

958
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,860
Haa

959
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Haa

960
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
One

961
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,860
What's going on?

962
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Both of them

963
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,860
Give a penalty

964
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,860
Go back to your room

965
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Haa

966
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,860
Haa

967
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Haa

968
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
Haa

969
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,860
Haa

970
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,860
Haa

971
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,860
Haa

972
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,860
Haa

973
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,860
Haa

974
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Haa

975
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
Haa

976
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Haa

977
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Haa

978
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
Haa

979
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
Haa

980
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Haa

981
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Haa

982
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
Haa

983
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,860
Haa

984
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,860
Haa

985
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Haa

986
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Haa

987
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
Haa

988
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,860
Haa

989
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Haa

990
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,860
Haa

991
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Haa

992
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
Haa

993
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
Haa

994
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Haa

995
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Haa

996
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
Haa

997
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,860
Haa

998
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,860
Haa

999
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Haa

1000
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,860
Haa

1001
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Haa

1002
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Haa

1003
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,860
Haa

1004
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Haa

1005
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Haa

1006
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
Haa

1007
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,360
Haa

1008
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,360
So that I can take everything from him!

1009
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,360
He looked down on women.

1010
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,360
His explosive power

1011
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:43,360
I need to develop that mental strength even more.

1012
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,360
So that I can hold my head high in faith

1013
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:53,360
I need to calm down and control my mind more.

1014
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,360
What’s that noise?

1015
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
But

1016
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
What's that sound?

1017
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Is there anyone in honesty?

1018
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Are you going to try to go outside?

1019
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Oh my god

1020
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
Someone please

1021
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Hmm

1022
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
The one excavated from Mexico?

1023
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
First place

1024
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Bistriest

1025
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Ride behind

1026
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
Aprekaeru Korori

1027
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
A while?! Could you please clarify?

1028
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Timekeeper Piakorak is a building star

1029
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
No one can stop us

1030
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

1031
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
And bought it from me at a high price—

1032
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

1033
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Chaochao

1034
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Wartwack Osaka

1035
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Top Runner

1036
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Cattrell Dawser

1037
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

1038
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
Wait a minute!

1039
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Port Levy

1040
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Wait a minute!

1041
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,360
Same as the current situation in Maldea

1042
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1043
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1044
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1045
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,360
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

1046
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
All the way from Italy?!

1047
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Stone Turtle

1048
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
I’ll go check in the books!

1049
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
All the way from Italy?!

1050
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

1051
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

1052
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
Just a little word of warning...

1053
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
But there's no doubt about it

1054
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
The sun will be setting soon.

1055
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I hate it

1056
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

1057
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Okay

1058
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
I did it

1059
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
I bought it

1060
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
in

1061
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Where is Soroshinshi now?

1062
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
It seems a bit suspicious

1063
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Generally you

1064
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
What is it?

1065
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
This is a gracious

1066
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,360
My name is

1067
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,360
Seteri

1068
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,360
It's a downshake

1069
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,360
By the stone turtle

1070
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,360
I'm from Italy

1071
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,360
<i>(And soon it’ll swallow the sun whole)</i>

1072
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
<i>(And soon it’ll swallow the sun whole)</i>

1073
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Like I said

1074
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
I'll do some research

1075
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,360
Please wait

1076
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
April

1077
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Ha

1078
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,360
I'll give you a little China.

1079
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Will the sun soon set?

1080
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,360
You'd better not go beyond that street.

1081
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Kiri appeared

1082
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,360
The sun stops

1083
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,360
Until then

1084
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
When I'm in town

1085
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
topknot

1086
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Please drink it

1087
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,360
I don't know you

1088
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Kiritomo Sky

1089
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Not yet

1090
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360

1091
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Second-rate

1092
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
Reach out your hand

1093
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,360
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

1094
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,360
I don't want to fall

1095
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Laughter and no laughter

1096
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Mix it up

1097
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Drinking stops

1098
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Thrown away in the dump

1099
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Better

1100
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Talking about Autumn

1102
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,360
This darkness

1103
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,360
Worth going

1104
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,360
Something's wrong

1105
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,360
I'm sure it's because I'm dry

1106
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,360
Until then

1107
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,360
surely

That was magnificent!

1157
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,280
That was magnificent!

1158
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,440
Silence

1159
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,280
It was all thanks to your pass!

1160
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,500
It was all thanks to your pass!

1161
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,500
Night night night night night Shalal ...

1162
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,420
Let me get changed first.

1163
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,840
Let me get changed first.

1164
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,580
Just a little

1165
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,780
The best thing about bad behavior

1166
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,900
Chochocho Maca's family car

1167
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,060
<i>Time passed like the
endless flow of water</i>

1168
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,380
<i>I think of that word
which is so familiar to me</i>

1169
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,860
a little bit

1170
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,840
It's on the bottom right

1171
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Thanks to your parts

1172
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,680
First, let's tell Dad about this victory.

1173
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Magician's Palace

1174
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Thanks to you

1175
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,140
In the school scene

1176
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,640
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

1177
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,640
thank you

1178
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,040
Please change your mind and wait for me

1179
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,540
<i>My friend, who’s always
pushing me to be better</i>

1180
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,540
<i>You’ve repented for the
wrong you did to Erina</i>

1181
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Time passed

1182
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,840
You

1183
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
With Dad

1184
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,840
Since I started calling

1185
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
To me

1186
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,340
Those familiar words

1187
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,840
think

1188
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,340
7 years

1189
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,340
<i>I always followed in your
footsteps, one step behind,</i>

1190
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,840
You are

1191
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,340
beautifully

1192
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,340
It was believed

1193
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,340
Make my Elio come true

1194
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,340
Friends

1195
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,340
think

1196
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
Elinae's

1197
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,840
Ayamachi

1198
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,340
You are

1199
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,840
I was eating

1200
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,340
Danny's replacement

1201
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,840
You are

1202
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,840
How are you feeling?

1203
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
How are you feeling?

1204
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
Your back

1205
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,840
How are you feeling?

1206
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,840
7 years

1207
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Where

1208
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
walked

1209
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
However

1210
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Why am I

1211
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
To you

1212
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:59,840
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...

1213
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Thanks to

1214
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
How do you like it

1215
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,840
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

1216
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
I admire you! Back then—

1217
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
teeth

1218
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
My lord!

1219
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Yes?

1220
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,840
ah

1221
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Yes?

1222
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
That's quite something

1223
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Skilled

1224
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Dioplant

1225
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Father!

1226
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
I can’t get rid of this cough...

1227
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Dio is already one of Joestarke's

1228
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Joe was Dibbala Singh Singh

1229
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,840
They say it’s a problem in London too.

1230
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,840
I feel safer at home.

1231
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
I give in.

1232
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,840
I feel safer at home.

1233
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Danda-sama

1234
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,840
I just got home

1235
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Dio is back

1236
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
And Jojo too

1237
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,840
You already know?

1238
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,840
My sanity won't stop

1239
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Inspector Archer here told me.

1240
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,840
I'm against it.

1241
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Hospitals these days are all about making money

1242
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,840
I truly am proud.

1243
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,840
I have such wonderful sons.

1244
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
There was a time

1245
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,840
The swelling in my hands and the pain in my chest will subside.

1246
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Congratulations to both of you on your wins

1247
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
But you gave me a chance.

1248
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,840
But you gave me a chance.

1249
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,840
I was born poor...

1250
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Cave

1251
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,840
we

1252
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,840
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

1253
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.

1254
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,840
I'm here

1255
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Really big nose

1256
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,840
wonderful

1257
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
There are already few

1258
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Especially Dio

1259
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,840
You did really well

1260
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
After the measures

1261
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,840
Be what you want to be

1262
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,840
To me, born of poor origins

1263
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Give it a chance

1264
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,840
thank you

1265
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Who on earth made this...

1266
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
And for what reason?

1267
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
thank you

1268
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

1269
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
Who on earth made this...

1270
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,840
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

1271
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,840
anywhere

1272
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Like that guy

1273
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,840
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

1274
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
So

1275
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
do

1276
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,840
staff

1277
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,840
It's a living mechanism that responds only to

1278
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,840
“My heart hurts,”

1279
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,840
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

1280
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,840
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

1281
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
If you do that

1282
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Also for the shape

1283
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
There's something destined

1284
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
I am

1285
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Dario Pland

1286
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,840
I'm always sorry

1287
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Rio-san

1288
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,840
About giving medicine

1289
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Speed

1290
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
thank you

1291
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
I

1292
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
I don't want to take a picture

1293
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1294
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1295
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
perhaps

1296
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

1297
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
My heart hurts

1298
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Hands waving

1299
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,840
The stone won't stop

1300
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
My voice

1301
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,840
A voice calling you

1302
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,840
My mother died.

1303
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Two of my fathers

1304
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
yes

1305
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Those shoes and

1306
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
What

1307
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Pawn

1308
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,840
It has changed

1309
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
yes

1310
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
Until that day

1311
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,840
He died.

1312
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,840
Zexal

1313
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

1314
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Yes.

1315
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
How to fight him

1316
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Right now

1317
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Lowering scum

1318
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,840
Battle and

1319
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Aha

1320
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Hardness

1321
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Threw it

1322
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,840
Assembled

1323
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Because I don't need it anymore

1324
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
The match is

1325
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Without love

1326
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,840
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

1327
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Stolen

1328
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Shall I enter?

1329
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Name

1330
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
It's different

1331
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

1332
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
Flowing

1333
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
This hell

1334
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Zexal

1335
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
white

1336
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
This hunt

1337
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
All

1338
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

1339
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
Win

1340
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
Human

1341
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,840
What’s the matter, JoJo?

1342
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,840
Be prepared

1343
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Show me that.

1344
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Huh?

1345
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
brando

1346
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Father

1347
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,840

As a gentleman,

01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
What's wrong?

1357
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Swear on that guy?

Wow

I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

1381
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
I’m convinced now...

1382
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

1383
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Excellent

1384
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

1385
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

1386
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

Yes,

Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

Well, I'll be doing my second and third thesis. In the meantime, I've decided to give them a perfect tour. I will not be receiving any medicine or medical treatment except from them.

I thought you must have a father,

I came here for the sake of my father.

1492
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So in the moment I kicked,

1493

Someone bandage his wound.

01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
…

1534
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Just now?

1535
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It’s a live human experiment!

1536
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Is it because of the earthquake?

1537
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
My voice

1538
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1539
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It's being born

1540
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You're the only one I care about

1541
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
What is this light?

1542
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
What is this light?

1543
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
What is this light?

1544
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Oh no!

1545
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
What is this light?

1546
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Kitsutsu's face is blue

1547
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
When you first

1548
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I gave Bamma a good sleep.

1549
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I'm sure

1550
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
He’s dead...

1551
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
He’s dead...

1552
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
He’s not dead!

1553
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Back of face

1554
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Wow

1555
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Wow

1556
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's not even possible that it will be born

1557
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
He’s not dead!

1558
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Earthquake Floyd

1559
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Delicious

1560
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's your fault

1561
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Wow

1562
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Make it plump

1563
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Pukula

1564
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,220
Should I do it or paint it?

1565
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,000
This white machine

1566
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Also, the company

1567
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Let me come over

1568
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's a journey of success

1569
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Hehehehe

1570
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Well then

1571
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Your research is dissolved

1572
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
His face is...

1573
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Do it

1574
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,000
Ah

1575
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,100
, not easy

1576
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,200
What

1577
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,100
What

1578
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,600
What is this, what did you do?

1579
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,100
Benge Gong

1580
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,000
Dead

1581
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,800
If this much koshin is stabbed in the head, it's only natural that he'll be punished.

1582
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,000
It's an ancient Guomon tool.

1583
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Not dead

1584
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Mamachi

1585
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
15

1586
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
He turned into ash...

1587
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,700
Sue

1588
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,300

1589
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,400

Dragon

1592
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,600
then

1593
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:30,760

1598

Also

1599
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,000
already

1600
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,360
ambitions

1601
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm excited about you

1602
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,480
graders

1603
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,580
Thank you.

1604
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,300
andin Glish

1605
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,220
Thank you.

1606
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,220
Thank you.

1607
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,700
maybe add orca Bureau

1608
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,380
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1609
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,660
me

1610
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Dio’s father...

1611
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
In sunlight

1612
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,360
Did it turn to ashes?

1613
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
This is

1614
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,360
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1615
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
So, Deo

1616
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,360
I arrested the criminal!

1617
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
I arrested the criminal!

1618
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Would you like to see for yourself?

1619
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
thank you

1620
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Hey

1621
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,360
That way of asking

1622
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,360
I see.

1623
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Oh, bollocks.

1624
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Then that means—

1625
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
Then that means—

1626
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
picture?

1627
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,360
I

1628
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,360
But a thief!

1629
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
But a thief!

1630
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,360
Dario Pland

1631
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,360
That is to say

1632
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,360
For you

1633
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
I'll tell you

1634
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
You

1635
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,360
This is from my time as an Akanbo.

1636
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,360
surely

1637
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,360
That I gave him this ring?

1638
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
But

1639
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
That I gave him this ring?

1640
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Finger speech

1641
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,360
A man who fell in and out

1642
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Corresponding

1643
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1644
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Jostar Kyoga

1645
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
It’s not a lie.

1646
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,360
This is what I gave him.

1647
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Something special made in pairs

1648
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,360
This is what I gave him.

1649
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
picture?

1650
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
This is yours.

1651
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,360
This is yours.

1652
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Today is

1653
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,360
My wife

1654
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,360
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1655
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
He had tears in his eyes.

1656
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
I

1657
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,360
If only I had caught Hajiri

1658
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,360
Would you like to wish me a happy birthday?

1659
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,360
Recorded items

1660
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,360
What came off

1661
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
The lineage of 10-year-old Rutou

1662
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,360
It's a cultural fact

1663
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,360
Understood

1664
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,360
curler

1665
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,360
Hey

1666
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
Woody

1667
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,360
Planned

1668
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,360
Planned

1669
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,360
Stop

1670
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,360
Well then

1671
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
Dario Pland is

1672
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,360
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>

1673
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Nothing

1674
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
Just

1675
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
It's Nust

1676
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,360
Just a lie

1677
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
That

1678
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
I know

1679
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Dio

1680
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
I was being careful.

1681
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,360
Why

1682
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,360
I

1683
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,360
Today's

1684
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,360
At that time

1685
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
On the current road

1686
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Tears

1687
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,360
you

1688
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
he

1689
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360
Didn't I say this?

1690
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
This sign language is

1691
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,360
He gave it to me.

1692
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,360
There was a picture

1693
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
Ugh

1694
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,360
Yes.

1695
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,360
this is

1696
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
What I gave him

1697
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,360
He is innocent

1698
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,360
Yao's wife

1699
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
That may be true,

1700
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
Mr. Pland

1701
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
yes

1702
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,360
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!

1703
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
That may be true,

1704
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
hand

1705
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
That may be true,

1706
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
Please buy me something

1707
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
Just a lie

1708
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Why that?

1709
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Deserveo

1710
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,360
If I

1711
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
In a strange way

1712
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
suffering

1713
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,360
If we had met

1714
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,360
<i>That pain</i>

1715
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,360
Did you?

1716
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
picture

1717
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:55,360
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1718
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,360
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1719
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,360
Light Yes

1720
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,360
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1721
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:07,360
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1722
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
That’s why...

1723
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,360
Shibi

1724
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Darkness

1725
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,360
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1726
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,360
Prayer place

1727
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,360
thank you

1728
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,360
you

1729
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,360
You're too kind

1730
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,360
This evil and

1731
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,360
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>

1732
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Maybe so

1733
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
But

1734
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,360
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1735
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,360
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1736
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,360
from

1737
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,360
People

1738
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,360
Tell me

1739
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Forget

1740
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,360
That courage

1741
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,360
That loneliness

1742
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,360
Let's hug

1743
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,360
I’ll wait for Dio.

1744
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,360
I’ll wait for Dio.

1745
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,360
To everything

1746
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Garu

1747
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
I

1748
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,360
Believe in people

1749
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,360
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1750
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1751
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Good

1752
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,360
it is

1753
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,360
someday

1754
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,360
Kakaya

1755
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Gudarou

1756
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,360
There is another

1757
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,360
And then...

1758
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,360
I

1759
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,360
Shichizuki

1760
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,360
Aki's Ambulance

1761
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,360
a

1762
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:01,360
bothersome

1763
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Noroi

1764
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,360
nine

1765
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,360
I

1766
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,360
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>

1767
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,360
still

1768
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Can be stopped

1769
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,360
You

1770
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,360
I heard Nauwa-san

1771
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,360
Frosia's man

1772
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1773
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1774
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,360
And the man

1775
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,360
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1776
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,360
Can't enter

1777
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
I heard

1778
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,360
It's the same as 30 years ago

1779
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,360
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1780
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,360
The Stone Mask...

1781
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,360
nailed down

1782
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
Kusabi

1783
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
Systemic training

1784
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
That morning sun

1785
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Like this

1786
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,360
It was red

1787
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,360
I, Dio, was...

1788
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:35,360
Longing for the road world

1789
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,360
My respected father

1790
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,360
Hit the rolling sea

1791
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,360
I have the antidote now.

1792
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,360
I have the antidote now.

1793
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,360
At my exact moment

1794
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,360
Day 1

1795
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,360
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1796
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,360
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1797
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,360
It truly hurts me.

1798
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Although you might not believe me,

1799
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,360
Those are my true feelings.

1800
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:16,360
Those are my true feelings.

1801
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,360
You’re honest like that.

1802
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,360
The final one
I will ask of you.

1803
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,360
The final one
I will ask of you.

1804
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,360
Can you give me more time?

1805
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,360
The final one
I will ask of you.

1806
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,360
I...

1807
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,360
Therefore

1808
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,360
My ambition was relentless.

1809
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,360
It's a shame, really.

1810
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,360
You may not understand, but this is the truth

1811
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,360
I understand, girl

1812
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,360
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1813
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,360
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1814
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,360
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1815
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,360
Can you give me some time?

1816
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,360
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1817
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,360
I

1818
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,360
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1819
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,360
Born into a poor family

1820
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,360
I got a palm.

1821
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,360
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1822
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,360
When words

1823
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,360
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1824
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,360
He was born with an innate destiny.

1825
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,360
I am

1826
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
I am

1827
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,360
Anyone

1828
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,360
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1829
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,360
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1830
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,360
I am

1831
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,360
I was allowed to introduce myself

1832
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,360
I'm Speedwagon of Osekkaiyaki

1833
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,360
I've been driving since it got stuck.

1834
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,360
I've seen a lot of different people

1835
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1836
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:15,360
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1837
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,360
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1838
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,360
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1839
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,360
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1840
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,360
or

1841
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,360
I don't want to see you get caught

1842
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,360
That man won't give up

1843
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,360
I was born with that fate

1844
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,360
Sores!

1845
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,360
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1846
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,360
You'll be released, but at least

1847
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,360
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1848
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
We've been together for seven years.

1849
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,360
Be careful!

1850
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,360
Understood

1851
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,360
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1852
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,360
For humans

1853
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,360
<i>The stars!</i>

1854
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,360
I am

1855
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,360
<i>The stars!</i>

1856
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,360
The Stone Mask?

1857
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,360
The limits of life

1858
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,360
What are you talking about?

1859
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,360
I'm so frustrated

1860
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,360
<i>My humanity!</i>

1861
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,360
There is nothing

1862
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,360
The empty logo

1863
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,360
With a glance next to me

1864
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,360
I can't see beyond

1865
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,360
No matter how much I write

1866
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Lord Joestar!

1867
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,360
Lord Joestar!

1868
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,360
That smiling sky

1869
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,360
I want you to know me

1870
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,360
This is...

1871
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,360
I wrote that

1872
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,360
On that beautiful day

1873
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,360
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1874
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,360
Your late mother’s ring.

1875
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,360
Your late mother’s ring.

1876
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,360
The stars

1877
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,360
Light

1878
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,360
One

1879
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,360
I am

1880
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,360
Mom

1881
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,360
Life

1882
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,360
It’s not so bad...

1883
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,360
Right

1884
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,360
Yes

1885
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,360
Yes

1886
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,360
Yes

1887
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,360
please

1888
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,360
Yes

1889
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,360
Hahahaha

1890
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,360
Hahahaha

1891
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,360
Yes

1892
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,360
Yes

1893
01:28:35,360 --> 01:29:01,140
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1894
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,140
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1895
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,140
Firmly

1896
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,140
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1897
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,140
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1898
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:29,140
Maybe when I got home I felt it was fair.

1899
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,140
Shoot

1900
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,140
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>

1901
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,140
Gradually

1902
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:52,140
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>

1903
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,140
In my son's arms

1904
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,140
father

1905
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,140
Do it.

1906
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,140
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>

1907
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,140
It was a mistake

1908
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:23,140
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1909
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,140
Survey

1910
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Whether it's a hearing or not

1911
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:32,140
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1912
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,140
Proudly

1913
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,140
everytime

1914
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:47,140
I said I'd save you

1915
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:51,140
I believe

1916
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,140
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1917
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:01,140
I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you

1918
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,140
What do you believe?

1919
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:10,140
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1920
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:13,140
What is pride?

1921
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:17,140
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1922
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:21,140
Flowing through this body

1923
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:25,140
Survey results

1924
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:28,140
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1925
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:32,140
What did you say?!

1926
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:35,140
Proudly

1927
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,140
What did you say?!

1928
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,140
Rishiki

1929
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,140
The voice of darkness

1930
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Inspector!

1931
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Look up at the stars

1932
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:55,140
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1933
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:02,140
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1934
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,140
Dance your heart out

1935
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!

1936
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:16,140
Send it to the stars that will become the future

1937
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:20,140
Flowing through this body

1938
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:24,140
Survey results

1939
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,140
H-He’s sucking his blood!

1940
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:31,140
It all makes sense

1941
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:37,140
I'm sad about this fate

1942
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:43,140
I’ve gained such incredible power!

1943
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,140
It's Keiban and Daiyan.

1944
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,140
what up?

1945
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,140
From the Stone Mask...

1946
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:01,140
Dion's body is missing.

1947
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,140
It became

1948
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,140
Satsuma

1949
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:06,140
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1950
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,140
Massage

1951
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,140
Keiban

1952
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,140
If that’s the case...

1953
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,140
Even though I was interrupted by forgetting

1954
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,140
If that’s the case...

1955
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,140
If that’s the case...

1956
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:29,140
Tomare

1957
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,140
Stop!

1958
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,140
Don't be silly

1959
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,140
It's early

1960
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
I don't know above

1961
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,140
I must make my will stronger!

1962
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:50,140
I must...

1963
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:56,140
I must make my will stronger!

1964
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:00,140
Suddenly puffed up...

1965
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:07,140
Hiriamado is hard to laugh at

1966
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:15,140
Mr. Joestar!

1967
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:25,140
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1968
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,140
From someday

1969
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:36,140
Your father's power

1970
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,140
A quick fix to the running.

1971
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,140
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1972
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:43,140
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1973
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:50,140
I told you, didn’t I?

1974
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:54,140
Humans have limits!

1975
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,140
If it stops

1976
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,140
Quit hiding behind that
curtain! Come out here!

1977
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,140
Stop it!

1978
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,140
Menoeka!

1979
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,380
Already

1980
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,400
It’s courage!

1981
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,740
Crab Cui Crab Cui

1982
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,040
a!

1983
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:51,960
Wow, that's fun

1984
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:58,780
I'll enjoy this wonderful power for a little while longer.

1985
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:05,280
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1986
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,100
Both specialists

1987
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,140
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1988
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,140
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1989
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:27,140
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1990
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,140
<i>JOJO: Please give me strength
DIO: For giving me strength</i>

1991
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:39,140
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1992
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,140
Kisamalabop

1993
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,140
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1994
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:53,140
I'm not even screaming that I can fly you

1995
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1996
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1997
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,140
Speed ​​Low

1998
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:01,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1999
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,140
Confusing

2000
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Don't run upstairs

2001
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,140
ah

2002
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:22,140
Run in the dark

2003
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,140
It's going up

2004
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,140
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

2005
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,140
I'm here

2006
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,140
Do you understand?

2007
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:36,140
Ladies, ladies, you first

2008
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:41,140
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

2009
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,140
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

2010
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,140
Finish eating

2011
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,140
It's useless, it's useless

2012
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:54,140
If you suck that life out

2013
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,140
This flickering

2014
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,140
Not from afar

2015
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,140
Let's give one

2016
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,140
Give me your strength

2017
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,140
From now on, always

2018
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,140
From your back

2019
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,140
On my back,

2020
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
The only one dying will be you!

2021
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,140
This body is immortal.

2022
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,140
Final exam

2023
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,140
The only one dying will be you!

2024
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,140
Women

2025
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:28,140
Women's Palm

2026
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,140
You are burning

2027
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,140
I'm dead

2028
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,140
I lost it immediately

2029
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,140
<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

2030
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:40,140
That too

2031
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,140
Burning

2032
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,140
The knife you stabbed Father with!

2033
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,140
That is

2034
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,140
I'll close you

2035
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:58,140
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

2036
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
More firepower

2037
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
That Mamoru's recovery power

2038
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,140
After placing it

2039
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,140
more

2040
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
More firepower

2041
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,140
Throw away

2042
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,140
The force of instinct

2043
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,140
If you do

2044
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,140
<i>This can’t be how my life ends—</i>

2045
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Shit

01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:06,020
It's your fault, I almost fell into the basement

2070
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:10,140
Where do you approach? I've grown fond of you

2071
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:16,140
As I thought, this crying that won't let go was there

2072
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,640
You can hear me.

2073
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,640
You can hear me.

2074
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:28,140
You can hear me.

2075
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,140
I hope you had a nice intermission.

2076
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:35,140
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

2077
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,140
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

2078
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:43,140
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

But lost everything.

01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:45,140
But lost everything.

2084
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:48,140
But lost everything.

2085
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:53,140
But lost everything.

2086
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:57,140
Can you hear me?

2087
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:02,140
I can hear you

2088
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:08,140
I mentioned the Astika people before.

2089
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:16,140
That was a 13th century mistake, not a 16th century one.

2090
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:20,140
The mask that man wore!

2091
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:31,140
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

2092
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:37,140
As someone said, I don't want to get old.

2093
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:46,140
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

2094
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:48,140
it was good

2095
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:53,140
But I want to do what I can at least,

2096
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:59,140
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

2097
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:03,140
Can I help you?

2098

I did a complica

2103
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:29,140
Refreshing

2104
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:32,140
Refreshing

2105
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:35,140
Refreshing

2106
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,140
The story so far seems like a fairy tale

2107
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,140
is definitely a reality

2108
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:47,140
And it gets weirder from here

2109
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:50,140
Yeah, strangely.

2110
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:55,140
At that time, the mansion was almost completely engulfed and collapsed.

2111
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:59,140
But Chosa was still there

2112
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,140
I was attacked by Dio

2113
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:04,140
But I lost everything

2114
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:08,140
Then see

2115
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,140
there were

2116
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:39,140
Did you see it over there? If you have this screen

2117
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:43,140
there were

2118
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:47,140
there were

2119
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:51,140
It’s really been too long.

2120
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:55,140
It’s really been too long.

2121
01:44:55,140 --> 01:45:05,140
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

2122
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:10,140
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

2123
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:13,140
This is me, but...

2124
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:19,140
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

2125
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:23,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2126
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:25,140
That's why I came

2127
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,140
I have enough vocabulary

2128
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:29,140
Please come on the 5th.

2129
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,140
Are you okay?

2130
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:56,140
My goodness, you caught
me with your broken arm!

2131
01:45:56,140 --> 01:46:05,140
<i>I can see it there</i>

2132
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:09,140
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

2133
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:15,140
Once again, when I see a vivid person

2134
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:19,140
<i>Your hand</i>

2135
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:30,140
I

2136
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:35,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2137
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:37,140
All the mansions

2138
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,140
Please stay calm now

2139
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2140
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,140
I'm glad you're alive

2141
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:49,140
You've been nursing me

2142
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:54,140
You are Yamasaka

2143
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:56,140
<i>Just the two of us</i>

2144
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:59,140
Who do you think looks like me? Erina Pendleton

2145
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,140
It's been a while

2146
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,140
Fate? That’s right.

2147
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,140
Why

2148
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,140
This is my father's hospital

2149
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:10,140
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

2150
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:13,140
I recently planned

2151
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:16,140
It's really been a while

2152
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:19,140
I was weak

2153
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:24,140
It wasn't my first time with you

2154
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:27,140
It was me who was young

2155
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:32,140
I couldn't face you

2156
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:36,140
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

2157
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:40,140
This voice remains unchanged

2158
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:44,140
Vivid reverb

2159
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:48,140
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

2160
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:52,140
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

2161
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:56,140
<i>(Don’t go out walking at night!)</i>

2162
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:04,140
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

2163
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,140
Elina

2164
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,140
sorry

2165
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:15,140
My mind is shaking and I lose consciousness

2166
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:18,140
With me and my arms

2167
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:21,140
I'll always support you

2168
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:25,140
Eye to eye

2169
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:29,140
Oh, it’s already so late!

2170
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,140
Plainness is courage

2171
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,140
I have to return home soon...

2172
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:41,140
I have to return home soon...

2173
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:45,140
It’s a terrifying thought!

2174
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:49,140
Terrifying, is it?

2175
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2176
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2177
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:01,140
overlap

2178
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:04,140
attract

2179
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,140
fit

2180
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,140
You dirty harlot!

2181
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:15,140
Continue with the two of us

2182
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,140
destiny

2183
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,140
yes

2184
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:23,140
The encounter of people

2185
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:27,140
Maybe it's decided by fate

2186
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,140
Kitty Dwagon

2187
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,140
Cool!

2188
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:43,140
lover

2189
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:46,140
lover

2190
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,140
lover

2191
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:51,140
See you again soon

2192
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,140
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

2193
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,140
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2194
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:57,140
A girl

2195
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,140
Early afternoon

2196
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:03,140
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

2197
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:07,140
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

2198
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:13,740
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

2199
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:21,340
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

2200
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,840
It's going to happen. He's going to appear.

2201
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:31,840
London is also popular

2202
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:35,200
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

2203
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:37,480
Black people don't eat

2204
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,740
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

2205
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,440
Me, afraid?!

2206
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,520
That’s right!

2207
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,300
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

2208
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,600
That’s right!

2209
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,800
I won't go home early

2210
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,300
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

2211
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,300
But there might be a Jap who will be the first to appear.

2212
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,300
Is that a lie?

2213
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:10,300
It's scary

2214
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,300
<i>Who are you?</i>

2215
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:21,300
<i>Who are you?</i>

2216
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:34,300
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

2217
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:39,300
Relax

2218
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,300
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2219
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,300
you

2220
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,300
I liked it

2221
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,300
Because I was seen

2222
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,300
I don't feel any pain

2223
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:06,300
There's no more of that

2224
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,300
Reborn now

2225
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,300
Let's start my life

2226
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:14,300
I have to heal my ache

2227
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,300
I need life

2228
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,300
So I feel less fulfilled

2229
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,300
Don't you want power?

2230
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:25,300
The Stone Mask...

2231
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:29,300
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

2232
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,300
It has to have been.

2233
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,300
I’m alright.

2234
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,300
But very rarely

2235
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,300
It’s alright.

2236
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,300
It’s alright.

2237
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,300
Eh?

2238
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,300
You are

2239
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,300
Who’s that?

2240
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,300
Has he been here
this whole time?

2241
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,300
To you

2242
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,300
What’s wrong?

2243
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,300
Jonathan Joestar!

2244
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,300
So you

2245
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,300
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

2246
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,300
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

2247
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,300
Such

2248
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:03,300
The Stone Mask?!

2249
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,300
Such

2250
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,300
The Stone Mask?!

2251
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:09,300
That's good enough now.

2252
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,300
The Stone Mask?!

2253
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,300
It seems like it will change

2254
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,300
There's already one

2255
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,300
Yes.

2256
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,300
Well then

2257
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,300
You don't have to worry anymore

2258
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,300
More spinning than ever before in my hands

2259
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,300
This is

2260
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,300
Such as

2261
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,300
do not have

2262
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,300
It's crowded

2263
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,300
Because of this

2264
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,300
You

2265
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,300
Come stretch

2266
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,300
Jack

2267
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:34,300
Zalipa

2268
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,300
This hand

2269
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,300
Anyway

2270
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,300
Atanosa

2271
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:43,300
<i>I am on your side!</i>

2272
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,300
Together

2273
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,300
What did you do to me?!

2274
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,300
Who are you?

2275
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:51,300
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

2276
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:54,300
What did you do to me?!

2277
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:55,300
nine

2278
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,300
My

2279
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,300
Restoration

2280
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:00,300
That's it

2281
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,300
Your

2282
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,300
It's a hobby

2283
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2284
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2285
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2286
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2287
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:18,300

2288
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:23,300
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

2289
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:34,300
Messy tears

2290
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:35,300
became

01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,300

01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:47,000
<i>Its name is—</i>

2295
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:54,960
yes

2296
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,280
It's okay

2297
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:02,680
Are you okay

2298
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,840
let's go

2299
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:09,300
Huh?

2300
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,300
<i>Making this miracle happen—</i>

2301
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,300
Who is it?

2302
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,300
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

2303
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,300
Jora-san Choustar-kun

2304
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,300
Huh? And

2305
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:21,300
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

2306
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,300
I'm surprised I survived

2307
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,300
That Iskamen's power

2308
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:31,300
Isukamen!

2309
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,300
Wait!

2310
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Jola-san

2311
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,300
Oshipa

2312
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,300
Keep it open

2313
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,300
By air

2314
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,300
Yes! The power of breathing!

2315
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:45,300
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!

2316
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,300
That's lame!

2317
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:49,300
Yes! The power of breathing!

2318
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,300
No appearance

2319
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,300
I am Separi Danshak

2320
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,300
All I have is courage

2321
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,300
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

2322
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,300
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

2323
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,300
Your breathing

2324
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:03,300
To him

2325
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,300
Your breathing

2326
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,300
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

Jora-san Jowstar

2329
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,300
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

2330
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:15,300
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

2331
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,300
Dio is alive?!

2332
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,300
Appearance

2333
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,300
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

2334
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,300
Dio is alive?!

2335
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,300
Follow me

2336
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,300
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

2337
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,300
Eyes change

2338
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:31,300
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

2339
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,300
<i>I finally found it!</i>

2340
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,300
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

2341
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,300
This breathing

2342
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,300
The place to wake up

2343
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:51,300
Now is the time to show it and run

2344
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,300
Smart

2345
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,300
Smart

2346
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:57,300
Smart

2347
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,300
Smart

2348
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:01,300
Smart

2349
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:03,300
<i>Destiny!</i>

01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:07,300
The concussion

Tyaeaars

2354
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:13,300
Energy is generated

2355
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,300
Mine and Dio’s!

2356
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,300
Hamon Energy

Horororororororororororororororororororororororororororo

2358
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:29,300
That turns humans into vampires.

2359
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,300
Thank you

2360
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,300
This miracle

2361
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,300
Dropped

2362
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,300
Ah, let’s put it this way.

2363
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,300
The Power of Hamon

2364
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,300
Kokum brings

2365
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,300
The power of liquid

2366
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,300
Smart

2367
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:51,300
Smart

2368
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Use a ripple!

2369
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,660
Everyone can create a little bit of energy in the flow of life.

2370
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:59,460
Carrying heroes and adjusting responses

2371
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,660
And that wave of energy

2372
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,780
And that wave of energy

2373
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:07,700
The power to defeat Dio!

2374
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:08,980
The power to defeat Dio!

2375
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:10,740
The power to defeat Dio!

2376
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,220
What do you mean, Dio?

2377
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,180
What do you mean, Dio?

2378
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:21,860
I frown at this breathing technique

2379
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,060
What do you mean, Dio?

2380
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,220
Dios

2381
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:29,180
I swear I’ll come back here again.

2382
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:33,300
The amount of treasure we have now is

2383
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,660
For now, please just go along with it!

2384
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,980
I followed Kamen

2385
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,860
Destroying and eating

2386
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:43,860
Dio is alive

2387
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:46,220
Just catch cute

2388
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,540
If you don't destroy it

2389
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:50,540
In the hands of destruction

2390
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,340
Well, is there any more?

2391
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,340
Yours

2392
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,660
Your world

2393
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,900
Fate is weak and sluggish

2394
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:59,900
I finally found it

2395
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,300
Tattered and worn

2396
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,980
Do you accept it?

2397
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,780
Eyes working hard

2398
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:10,740
Everything was discussed

2399
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,740
Sma

2400
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,740
Sma

2401
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,020
Sma

2402
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,660
Sma

2403
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:27,900
destiny

2404
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,380
fight

2405
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:38,900
That's my destiny

2406
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:41,380
You mean me?

2407
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,260
The will of the person

2408
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,500
Extracting the power of the path from "no"

2409
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:48,100
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2410
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,100
it is

2411
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,620
You must take blood energy from others.

2412
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:53,940
On the other hand, Hamon's power

2413
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,780
Mizukaru's blood flows

2414
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:58,340
Extracting energy

2415
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:00,820
<i>I am left behind</i>

2416
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,060
<i>I am left behind</i>

2417
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,300
Yeah

2418
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,300
It's Smari

2419
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:14,340
To remove this jamon

2420
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,740
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

2421
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:19,740
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

2422
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,140
Jamon

2423
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,820
<i>I want to scream!</i>

2424
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,820
They'll explode

2425
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,900
And the tears of energy

2426
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:35,420
It has the same shape as the sunlight

2427
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,300
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

2428
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,700
yes

2429
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:40,540
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

2430
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:44,940
Develop an attitude that turns courage into strength

2431
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,660
woman

2432
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,460
Dio

2433
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,740
Energy

2434
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,900
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>

2435
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:57,100
Right now I just want you to stay

2436
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:03,180
I'll definitely come back to this place

2437
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,540
This is

2438
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:10,780
Is it a female jamon?

2439
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,780
Yeah

2440
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,940
Haa

2441
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:41,180
Clouds flow

2442
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:44,060
The wind carries my thoughts

2443
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:46,060
Measurement

2444
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:49,100
go around

2445
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:53,580
I nodded.

2446
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:59,020
<i>Our stars shine together</i>

2447
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:02,860
In sadness

2448
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:09,820
Shining stars

2449
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:16,780
I won't lead you to the fate you desire

2450
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,100
I got stuck in the mud

2451
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:29,740
<i>I will live on!</i>

2452
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:33,580
Left behind

2453
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:36,620
Living the dream

2454
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,660
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

2455
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,660
Loneliness is

2456
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,660
For whom?

2457
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,660
Even if it doesn't reach

2458
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:51,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2459
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,660
I want to scream

2460
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,660
I

2461
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:59,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2462
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,660
Why are you so strong?!

2463
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:03,660
I

2464
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:05,660
Because

2465
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,660
you

2466
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,660
There is light

2467
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,660
anytime

2468
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:17,660
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

2469
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,660
I

2470
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,660
Spending my days

2471
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,660
Let's live

2472
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,660
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

2473
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,660
While

2474
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,660
This place

2475
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,660
He’s strong enough to rival you.

2476
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,660
He’s strong enough to rival you.

2477
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,660

Humans are like this Jikro'a

Daizara doesn't have a phone

Why this?

I'm surprised I was able to see Hamogo on such a short trip.

2552
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,400
yeah…

2553
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,400

02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,400
JoJo...

It was my father!

It was my father!

2557
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,400
But that's...

2558
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,400
Not the same as Dio

2559
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,400
To insult someone

2560
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,400
It's fundamentally different from the power he was stealing.

2561
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,400
Another is the same power

2562
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:08,400

02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,400
And the resolve to face the consequences.

2574
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,400
Pain is life

Don’t forget this goal.

The screen is not a word

He had been murdered.

Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

2622
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,400
and

2623
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,400

02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,400
Right?

So then, what exactly is “courage”?

2640
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,800
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

What are you yammering on about!

2642

Be careful

2676
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,260
Dio doesn't have a strong hand here.

generations in our great England.

2851
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:41,420
At Kisamara's command, I will disinfect this wound in the air.

2852
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:46,420
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2853
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:59,420
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2854
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:08,420
I'll let you sleep.

2855
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,420
The width of the sun!

2856
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:14,420
bread!

2857
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:18,420
品積品積!

2858
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:25,420
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2859
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:30,420
I can control my body freely.

2860
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:37,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2861
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:40,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2862
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:42,420
Help!

2863
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:48,420
Waste waste waste waste!

2864
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
breathe?

2865
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,420
Conger eel?

2866
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:59,420
Hehe, if that's the case, it would be fitting for you to play a fanfare for me.

2867
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:04,580
Hahaha

2868
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:14,180
There's no stock strategy that suits you, friend.

2869
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:16,420
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2870
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:18,420
Do you remember?

2871
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:27,420
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2872
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:31,020
Elizabeth's assassination attempt

2873
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:36,040
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2874
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:40,180
Mary Stuart

2875
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:42,620
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2876
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:44,500
Two people

2877
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,420
It's about an angry Kishi.

2878
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:48,620
Dad's

2879
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:50,220
Now

2880
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:55,020
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2881
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,620
Jojon, Dion

2882
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:00,140
Today, this tradition is passed down in England.

2883
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:03,740
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2884
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:06,540
Living in the spirit of Shingeru

2885
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:07,500
Kishi's

2886
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:11,940
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2887
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:16,420
Once upon a time, 300 years ago

2888
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:20,900
Let's cheer on the two of us

2889
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:25,460
Jojohn, Elizabethan

2890
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:29,940
Beautiful Mary Stuart

2891
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:34,460
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2892
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:37,940
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2893
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:41,140
Hahahahahaha

2894
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:43,060
From now on

2895
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:47,140
Ophiry like you

2896
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:49,540
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2897
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:51,940
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2898
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:56,740
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2899
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:59,140
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2900
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,340
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2901
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:05,740
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2902
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,020
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2903
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:10,340
Find peace

2904
02:27:10,340 --> 02:27:15,140
Use clothing

2905
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:16,340
Flowing Time

2906
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,340
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2907
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:19,460
By Elizabeth

2908
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:21,540
A friend's container is placed on it

2909
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,940
I'll be caught

2910
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:28,340
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2911
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:32,940
To save Mary

2912
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:37,340
<i>Either one—</i>

2913
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:41,940
Elizabeth calls out

2914
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:46,340
You guys should mess with us

2915
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:53,140
Save Shugun's life.

2916
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:55,440
To Elizabeth

2917
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:59,140
There is no denying it

2918
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:04,140
Our difficult story

2919
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:09,540
Even history bends before me!

2920
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,540
It's so easy to get caught up in it

2921
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:13,940
I'll scoop up the maid

2922
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:16,540
This system is unacceptable

2923
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,940
I bowed my head

2924
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,340
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2925
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,740
Kill them all!

2926
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:26,740
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2927
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:31,340
Wow

2928
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:35,040
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2929
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:40,440
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2930
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:45,040
The way you feel—

2931
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,340
The way you feel—

2932
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,440
The way you feel—

2933
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:53,440
But I also bear my own burdens!

2934
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:56,140
Your pride, your resentment.

2935
02:28:56,140 --> 02:28:58,440
I can’t even imagine it!

2936
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:01,840
I'll wait

2937
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:12,840
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2938
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:20,840
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2939
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:22,840
A goosebump-inducing proposition

2940
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:24,540
Alright, go ahead!

2941
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:27,140
But they should have done better.

2942
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:29,840
I couldn't do anything in the first match.

2943
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,840
I won’t let you interfere!

2944
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,540
You may be right.

2945
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:35,740
But nothing is meaningless

2946
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:38,440
The same goes for when you came to this house.

2947
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:40,640
I won’t let you interfere!

2948
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:43,140
I won’t let you interfere!

2949
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:45,840
I want to believe

2950
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:48,240
People are like destiny

2951
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:54,840
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2952
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:57,040
Are you seeing stars?

2953
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:06,640
Or either one

2954
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:10,040
Gradually

2955
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:16,040
Say it's your fault

2956
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:27,040
The two of them

2957
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:34,040
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2958
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:40,040
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2959
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:42,040
Got it?

2960
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:52,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2961
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:55,040
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2962
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:58,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2963
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:01,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2964
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,040
Everyone looks happy

2965
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
A continuation of that day

2966
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:10,040
Tarkus Bellaford

2967
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:12,040
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2968
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,040
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2969
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:17,040
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2970
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:18,040
That's it

2971
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:21,040
Slow Idiom Kiss Bellaford

2972
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,040
and Tarkus

2973
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:24,040
I think that's a bit

2974
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:27,040
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2975
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:30,040
But I also have something to carry

2976
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:33,040
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2977
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,040
How many were filled?

2978
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:41,040
The man's anger

2979
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,040
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2980
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,040
My master

2981
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:46,040
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2982
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:50,040
I would like to draw every day of this man's life.

2983
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:53,040
Okay, that's good.

2984
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,040
Make a good list and get it

2985
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:01,040
If it hurts, run away

2986
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:04,040
Survey

2987
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:08,040
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2988
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,040
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2989
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,040
nailed down

2990
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,040
Wedge

2991
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,040
Anyway

2992
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,040
This pain means nothing to me!

2993
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,040
Like this

2994
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:36,040
It was red

2995
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:40,040
Osa

2996
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:42,040
Why aren’t you moving?

2997
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,040
Just now,

2998
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,040
You can feel pain!

2999
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,040
I am, I am

3000
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Nothing to try

3001
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
I'm not good

3002
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,040
Pain?

3003
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,040
That’s why...

3004
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,040
Even at a time like this

3005
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,040
Even if you give up

3006
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,040
Come

3007
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,040
Carefully

3008
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,040
I stopped fighting you.

3009
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,040
I stopped fighting you.

3010
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,040
I stopped fighting you.

3011
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:14,040
Make Irumide

3012
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:17,040
I kept chasing

3013
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,040
Remember

3014
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
You are human!

3015
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,040
You are human!

3016
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,040
You are human!

3017
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,040
Pain...

3018
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,040
I was just angry.

3019
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,040
Pain...

3020
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:31,040
Is proof of life!

3021
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3022
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3023
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:36,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3024
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,040
What's scary is

3025
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,040
It's not pain

3026
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:41,040
already

3027
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,040
What you should know

3028
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,040
regain

3029
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,040
Morning tomorrow

3030
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:47,040
Tomorrow

3031
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,040
Tomorrow

3032
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,040
Now

3033
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,040
There

3034
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:57,020

02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:59,040
Tokewa

3036
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,040
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3037
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:01,040
When

3038
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:02,040
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

3039
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:09,040
Kiki's

3040
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,040
Looking back at the station

3041
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:14,360
Is it urgent?

3042
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:16,360
Don't wait for tomorrow

3043
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:20,360
I start walking

3044
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:24,360
Should believe

3045
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:28,360
It should be said that

3046
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:34,360
Tomorrow Now

3047
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:36,360
girl

3048
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:42,360
The Beat of Decision with You

3049
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:48,360
Just as I thought...

3050
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:51,360
When I looked into it

3051
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:53,360
That

3052
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:55,460
I, Dio, will—

3053
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:01,360
Pikima

3054
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:04,360
pain

3055
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:12,360
No or

3056
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,360
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3057
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:18,360
You are feeling pain now

3058
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,360
pain

3059
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:27,360
That's why I stopped being that Sarakai

3060
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,360
So you stopped the prefecture

3061
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,360
You are a proud wrecker

3062
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:38,360
Human

3063
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:41,360
What I saw

3064
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:45,360
Sennorakashi

3065
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:50,360
This is a human being

3066
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,360
Because there are similarities

3067
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:57,360
I can feel the joy of being here now

3068
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:59,360
I can be here now

3069
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:09,360
I’ll get you!

3070
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:12,360
I feel now

3071
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,360
Bravo

3072
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:19,360
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3073
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:25,360
Something like this

3074
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:28,360
and

3075
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:30,360
Let's go

3076
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:42,360
To save souls

3077
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,360
He collapsed.

3078
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,360
Come

3079
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:53,360
Affection

3080
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:58,360
Affection

3081
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:03,360
No way

3082
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:07,360
To think he would defeat Kurokiko

3083
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:11,360
If we lose you—

3084
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:14,360
There’s no time to be sad.

3085
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:21,360
Haybay Day

3086
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,360
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

3087
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:26,360
In the end,

3088
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:34,360
What changes is not the outcome but the vile Hamon

3089
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,360
It's dangerous, Tama

3090
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:43,360
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

3091
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:55,360
Brami's brother

3092
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:58,960
Loss of motivation and enthusiasm

3093
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:08,380
驚

3094
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:14,360
Lots of Ou

3095
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:20,860
From now on

3096
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:26,860
<i>Into my spirit</i>

3097
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:30,860
I'll do it, I'll do it!

3098
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:38,860
JoJo

3099
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:48,360
From here on...

3100
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:50,360
My companion

3101
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:53,360
JoJo!

3102
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:14,360
Wow

3103
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:18,060
always

3104
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:20,360
Search Chokil

3105
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:25,360
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3106
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:30,360
Please stop it

3107
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:33,360
Carlton!

3108
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:36,360
Oklaine!

3109
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:38,240
Windows 4

3110
02:39:38,240 --> 02:40:08,040
Hey, Jebel, Jebel, if you're gone, I'll be sad, but one day I'll destroy my eyes, but hey, I'm happy with my life. Finally, I've entrusted it to you.

3111
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:16,240
Hey, you're my hope.

3112
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:31,240
<i>The way to you...</i>

3113
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:55,240
You taught me the meaning of my life, my destiny, and the greatness of being human - courage.

3114
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:15,240
The light that was received would seep in. In my heart, I felt as if I was both dead and breathing at the same time.

3115
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:22,240
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

3116
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:37,240
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

3117
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:54,240
<i>You and I are different</i>

3118
02:41:55,240 --> 02:42:05,240
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

3119
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:17,240
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

3120
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:29,240
There is one thing that is so certain that it is in my heart right now.

3121
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:38,240
Embrace it, because this moves,

3122
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:44,240
Look at the stars.

3123
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:56,240
What remains is the brilliance of humanity,

3124
02:42:57,240 --> 02:43:07,240
Light up the darkness and bring your return,

3125
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:13,240
Come back,

3126
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:42,240
happiness.

3127
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:01,240
You’re just afraid.

3128
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:07,240
I hear a voice calling to you,

3129
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:13,240
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

3130
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:17,240
You ran away from it.

3131
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:21,240
Unlike you.

3132
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:25,240
It's my fault.

3133
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:30,240
The ends justify the means.

3134
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:34,240
I will win,

3135
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:38,240
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

3136
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:41,240
Disobey justice,

3137
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:44,240
All of this is fate!

3138
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:50,240
Use and take everything,

3139
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:53,240
Disobey justice,

3140
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:56,240
What will your legacy be?

3141
02:44:56,240 --> 02:45:00,240
What will your legacy be?

3142
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,240
Laughing,

3143
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,240
I want it,

3144
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:04,240
it is,

3145
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:08,240
it is,

3146
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:16,240
And then died!

3147
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:25,240
Here it comes,

3148
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:32,240
Your father.

3149
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:36,240
Well then,

3150
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:41,240
Is this the world you've left behind?

3151
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:46,240
what,

3152
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:53,240
The world you lost long ago,

3153
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:57,240
For the sake of revenge...

3154
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:05,240
It's a wonderful world where I control everything

3155
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,240
Lion

3156
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:12,240
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

3157
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:15,240
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

3158
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:24,240
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

3159
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:28,240
You're just scared

3160
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:33,240
Humans

3161
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,240
That's why I gave up being human

3162
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,240
To get it

3163
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:48,240
Beyond human

3164
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:59,240
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

3165
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:04,240
I won

3166
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:09,240
The only result is that you are in control.

3167
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:13,240
It's all just a dream

3168
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,240
But

3169
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,240
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3170
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:24,240
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3171
02:47:25,240 --> 02:47:27,240
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3172
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:29,240
Rumbling, rumbling, rumbling

3173
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:37,240
To me

3174
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:41,240
Give me strength

3175
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,240
dead

3176
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:55,240
Your

3177
02:47:57,240 --> 02:48:00,240
It's my father

3178
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:08,240
That's right

3179
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:17,240
smile

3180
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:21,240
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

3181
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,760
The current situation is

3182
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:28,740
To tell the story behind

3183
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:32,240
Ko how proprio

3184
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:35,240
<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

3185
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:38,240
When I tell you the inside story like that,

3186
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,240
I've been forced to ask you out

3187
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:41,240
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

3188
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,240
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3189
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:45,320
hahhh

3190
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:48,540
Finally, a name that stands out

3191
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:50,840
What's left now

3192
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:53,260
2019

3193
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:57,860
<i>With my life on the
line, I’ll prove it now!</i>

3194
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:01,220
務 manual you

3195
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:04,140
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3196
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,740
Holy and low

3197
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:07,680
merged

3198
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,560
for that

3199
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:10,560
pain

3200
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:12,720
No problem

3201
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:20,220
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

3202
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:26,720
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

3203
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:31,520
<i>I won’t stop beating you
until you’re finished!</i>

3204
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:37,520
<i>I won’t stop beating you
until you’re finished!</i>

3205
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:40,520
Omelo, kill me

3206
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:46,520
I’m melting!

3207
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:51,520
You threw me away and taught me the best, so I'll pour in the bargain sale in front of the meaning of selling you

3208
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,520
Yes, I did it. I knocked my hand down. That's wrong.

3209
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:03,840
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

3210
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:07,020
緊弱緊弱

3211
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:11,020
Sasasa, no no

3212
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:16,020
It's so tense, but it's actually deceiving you

3213
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:17,220
JoJo

3214
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:23,020
Now you too will come to me, and death will resonate with you

3215
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:29,620
You ran away from humans

3216
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:33,940
What's not making me spill right now?

3217
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:38,080
<i>Extra, extra! Read all about it!</i>

02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:51,660
All live

3407
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:54,660
<i>We feel a bizarre friendship</i>

3408
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:59,660
Now, I'm going to be in trouble.

3409
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:02,660
Maybe this time

3410
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:05,660
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

3411
03:00:08,660 --> 03:00:12,660
Sell ​​happily and live

3412
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:18,660
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

3413
03:00:18,660 --> 03:00:23,660
Until you don't need it yet

3414
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:26,660
Okay then

3415
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:34,660
<i>We’ll reach out to the stars</i>

3416
03:00:35,660 --> 03:00:37,660
<i>Have become one</i>

3417
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:40,660
<i>Our two fates</i>

3418
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:42,660
Speak

3419
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:44,660
<i>Have become one</i>

3420
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:51,660
This guy

3421
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:56,660
Dead

3422
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,660
Dead

3423
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:22,660
Dead

3424
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:24,660
Dead

3425
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:26,660
Dead

3426
03:01:26,660 --> 03:01:28,660
Dead

3427
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:30,660
Dead

3428
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:31,660
Dead

3429
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:37,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3430
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:41,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3431
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:46,660
The destiny and adventure

3432
03:01:46,660 --> 03:01:48,660
Dead

3433
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:50,660
Dead

3434
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:56,660
Let's talk forever

3435
03:01:56,660 --> 03:01:59,660
Of course,

3436
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:03,660
Something in my eyes

3437
03:02:09,660 --> 03:02:12,660
Two in One

3438
03:02:12,660 --> 03:02:16,660
Feeling the friendship of a dog

3439
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:20,660
That's right

3440
03:02:20,660 --> 03:02:23,660
Without you

3441
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:26,660
Because you were there

3442
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:28,660
something

3443
03:02:28,660 --> 03:02:32,660
Now I

3444
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:34,660
want

3445
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:37,660
Find

3446
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:40,660
To your favorite destiny

3447
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:44,660
Beautiful Mikade

3448
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:47,660
In the stars

3449
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,660
I drink

3450
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:51,660
The two

3451
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:55,660
That fate

3452
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:57,660
It was terrible

3453
03:02:57,660 --> 03:02:59,660
Another breast

3454
03:02:59,660 --> 03:03:02,660
Quietly unknown

3455
03:03:02,660 --> 03:03:06,660
One saw the stars

3456
03:03:06,660 --> 03:03:34,660
Tour

3457
03:03:34,660 --> 03:03:38,140
Is it polar?

3458
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,120
pick up the station

3459
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:02,700
my frightenedzz

3460
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:10,700
Speedwagon is so cool!

3461
03:04:12,700 --> 03:04:16,700
Yuishie, Yoishie!

3462
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3463
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3464
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3465
03:06:02,700 --> 03:06:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3466
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3467
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3468
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3469
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3470
03:08:32,700 --> 03:08:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3471
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:06,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3472
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3473
03:10:02,700 --> 03:10:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3474
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:36,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3475
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3476
03:11:32,700 --> 03:11:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3477
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3478
03:12:32,700 --> 03:12:46,700
The best thing about this park was that the smiles of all the customers were the biggest smiles. I felt that very strongly at the park.

3479
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:54,700
I was truly happy that such a miraculous park had been able to survive to the very end.

3480
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:58,700
Thank you for watching.

3481
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:08,700
Now, Mr. Kong, please.

3482
03:13:08,700 --> 03:13:12,700
Thank you for watching.

3483
03:13:12,700 --> 03:13:16,700
Great staff, great cast.

3484
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:20,700
Then they brought the outbreak to the theater.

3485
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:24,700
I'm glad to meet everyone who has watched the video.

3486
03:13:24,700 --> 03:13:26,700
I easily overcame the progression.

3487
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,700
The players were able to go home after today's academy.

3488
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:32,700
I'm happy for people.

3489
03:13:32,700 --> 03:13:36,700
I let it happen.

3490
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:38,700
thank you.

3491
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:42,700
And I was struggling as a single person.

3492
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,700
My son!

3493
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:48,700
That's amazing!

3494
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:50,700
I'm so happy!

3495
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:52,700
I'm so happy!

3496
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:56,700
It's great.

3497
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,700
It's great.

3498
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:00,700
thank you.

3499
03:14:00,700 --> 03:14:04,700
Then, I received the greeting I just mentioned.

3500
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:06,700
Thank you for watching.

3501
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:08,700
thank you very much.

3502
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:10,700
Thank you very much.

3503
03:14:10,700 --> 03:14:14,700
Everyone, please check out Fauci's Prround Funding.

3504
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:16,700
thank you.

3505
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:18,700
thank you.

3506
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,700
thank you.

3507
03:14:20,700 --> 03:14:22,700
MAMORU: It’s already over.

3508
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:24,700
Thank you! Thank you!

3509
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:26,700
MAMORU: It’s already over.

3510
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:28,700
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

3511
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:30,700
Thank you! Thank you!

3512
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:36,700
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

3513
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:38,700
He doesn't know either.

3514
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:40,700
He doesn't know either.

3515
03:14:40,700 --> 03:14:42,700
He doesn't know either.

3516
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:46,700
So Misha, please.

3517
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:48,700
yes.

3518
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:50,700
It was a huge hurdle.

3519
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:54,700
I'm not sure if I can speak well,

3520
03:14:54,700 --> 03:14:58,700
This is Elina Tendul and her character Shimis Misha.

3521
03:15:02,700 --> 03:15:06,700
Thank you very much for coming to the audience today.

3522
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:10,700
{\an5}Brought to you by Ossan Subs

3523
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:12,700
{\an5}Brought to you by Ossan Subs

3524
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:16,700
I was able to reach this great war retreat,

3525
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:18,700
The strength of each and every cast member,

3526
03:15:18,700 --> 03:15:20,700
{\an5}Subtitling
S_Mage and Jama Kitten

3527
03:15:20,700 --> 03:15:22,700
For supporting this work,

3528
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:26,700
{\an5}Special thanks to our wonderful
Japanese friends who helped us along the way!

3529
03:15:34,700 --> 03:15:36,700
Please do, everyone.

3530
03:15:44,700 --> 03:15:46,700
Please look at the stars, everyone.

3531
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:52,700
So please have a great war.

3532
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:54,700
yes.

3533
03:15:54,700 --> 03:15:56,700
It's your job to burn the speeder!

3534
03:16:00,700 --> 03:16:04,700
It was my first experience and it was really difficult for me.

3535
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,700
But really.

3536
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:08,700
It was really hard, but

3537
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:10,700
Already, somehow,

3538
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:12,700
To get support,

3539
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:14,700
Thanks,

3540
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:16,700
It was really hard, but

3541
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:18,700
Already, somehow,

3542
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:20,700
To get support,

3543
03:16:20,700 --> 03:16:22,700
Like supporting them,

3544
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:24,700
Supporting each other,

3545
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:26,700
Those words truly mean,

3546
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
It just seemed to enter my body.

3547
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:30,700
It's a really wonderful place,

3548
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:32,700
Thanks to that,

3549
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:34,700
I was able to cut it thickly.

3550
03:16:34,700 --> 03:16:38,700
So, I have nothing but the best to say,

3551
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:40,700
With everyone here on stage,

3552
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:42,700
As Kochi-san also said,

3553
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:44,700
Not at all.

3554
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,700
Although he's not here now,

3555
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:48,700
The staff who helped me create it,

3556
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:50,700
and,

3557
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:52,700
This role,

3558
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:54,700
For five months,

3559
03:16:54,700 --> 03:16:56,700
I really put it together,

3560
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:58,700
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

3561
03:16:58,700 --> 03:17:00,700
Love women,

3562
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:02,700
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

3563
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:04,700
Including everyone who loves me,

3564
03:17:04,700 --> 03:17:06,700
Really,

3565
03:17:06,700 --> 03:17:08,700
thank you very much!

3566
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:16,700
Shirae-san...

3567
03:17:16,700 --> 03:17:18,700
Good job, Dig putting is burning well.

3568
03:17:18,700 --> 03:17:21,700
I certainly understand.

3569
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:22,700
Honchitsu,

3570
03:17:22,700 --> 03:17:26,700
To Sepulija,

3571
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:28,700
To Sepulija,

3572
03:17:28,700 --> 03:17:29,940
RPM improved office

3573
03:17:29,940 --> 03:17:31,700
Wang's school committee came to the event.

3574
03:17:31,700 --> 03:17:32,700
Thank you for your continued support.

3575
03:17:32,700 --> 03:17:34,700
Thank you very much.

3576
03:17:36,700 --> 03:17:37,700
Really,

3577
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:39,700
The first thought is,

3578
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:42,700
There were a lot of different things that happened.

3579
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:45,700
The two of them, Shotaro, and now, here

3580
03:17:45,700 --> 03:17:48,700
The one who finished the tree, and another Teperi,

3581
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:52,700
Hiro-kun and I accomplished so much on our own.

3582
03:17:52,700 --> 03:17:55,700
Mom, this company is a one-lens camera for people.

3583
03:17:55,700 --> 03:17:58,700
With the determination to align

3584
03:17:58,700 --> 03:18:00,700
I came here with the aim of becoming a teacher of Wang's music.

3585
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:03,700
Really, without anyone calling

3586
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:05,700
Of course, I'm really grateful that I've come this far.

3587
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:08,700
Medical support from staff

3588
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:10,700
It is the result of your efforts.

3589
03:18:10,700 --> 03:18:12,700
Every single stage, really

3590
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:14,700
I just want to omit it.

3591
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:15,700
Every single stage, really

3592
03:18:15,700 --> 03:18:18,700
The applause of the Baraline and 5000 yen are us

3593
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:20,700
Now the cast is

3594
03:18:20,700 --> 03:18:22,700
The truth is, it's your Hamon energy.

3595
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:24,700
How much courage it gave us

3596
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:27,700
I think that's what we really feel.

3597
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:31,700
I was really close to Hantoshi and Okabetsu right now.

3598
03:18:31,700 --> 03:18:34,700
It really is like a family

3599
03:18:34,700 --> 03:18:37,700
It means that today will be a valley from tomorrow onwards.

3600
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:39,700
Hey hey

3601
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:41,700
Annie

3602
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:45,700
A little Syriaria please

3603
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:47,700
Just a little bit

3604
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:49,700
I feel lonely though

3605
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:51,700
I really love myself

3606
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:52,700
This woman's world

3607
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:54,700
And with these beloved members

3608
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:56,700
In this theater

3609
03:18:56,700 --> 03:18:58,700
Being able to breathe the same air

3610
03:18:58,700 --> 03:19:00,700
That's right.

3611
03:19:00,700 --> 03:19:03,700
The one who touched everyone's hearts was

3612
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:09,700
I have become a treasure too

3613
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,700
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

3614
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:13,700
Thank you so much everyone

3615
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:15,700
thank you

3616
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:17,700
It will end again

3617
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:19,700
Blatzer

3618
03:19:23,700 --> 03:19:25,700
Please watch

3619
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:31,700
I changed my boss's environment.

3620
03:19:31,700 --> 03:19:32,700
Another ironworker

3621
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:34,700
Thank you for today

3622
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:39,700
It's totally free

3623
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:41,700
So many

3624
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:44,700
As you have written earlier,

3625
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:46,700
Right from here on

3626
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:48,700
As in the title above

3627
03:19:48,700 --> 03:19:51,700
It was a strange adventure.

3628
03:19:51,700 --> 03:19:56,700
There are so many people like you.

3629
03:19:56,700 --> 03:19:57,700
Only the curtain of Hara

3630
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:59,700
Born at the Imperial Theatre

3631
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,700
The Imperial Theatre

3632
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,700
The current theater is closing.

3633
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:05,700
As a final review

3634
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,700
By producing

3635
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:09,700
Not Minami

3636
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:11,700
Memories

3637
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:13,700
Participated

3638
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:15,700
My friends are cast members here.

3639
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,700
It is staff

3640
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:19,700
And the original author

3641
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:21,700
The main cast members

3642
03:20:21,700 --> 03:20:23,700
And here are the books.

3643
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,700
After five years of work

3644
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:27,700
Apparently it was rewritten 17 times.

3645
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:29,700
It was in this flow that I was born.

3646
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:31,700
This work

3647
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:33,700
Being accepted by everyone like this

3648
03:20:33,700 --> 03:20:34,700
Like this

3649
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:35,700
Many musicals

3650
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:37,700
We have some works from overseas.

3651
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,700
Such works are

3652
03:20:38,700 --> 03:20:39,700
Zahiozic Zero is

3653
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,700
On Broadway and in the West End

3654
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:43,700
That's what we're here for

3655
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:44,700
In books

3656
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:46,700
While making large replicas

3657
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:48,700
Let's fight

3658
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,700
Japanese style

3659
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:51,700
We provide information.

3660
03:20:51,700 --> 03:20:52,700
This work is

3661
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:53,700
What you all saw

3662
03:20:53,700 --> 03:20:54,700
Exactly

3663
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:56,700
From zero to one

3664
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:57,700
Became Zahiozic

3665
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:59,700
I think it's a work of art.

3666
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:00,700
This work

3667
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:01,700
Someday again

3668
03:21:01,700 --> 03:21:03,700
Inherited

3669
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:05,700
It may be a big performance,

3670
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:07,700
This Zahiozik

3671
03:21:07,700 --> 03:21:08,700
I was at Zero 1

3672
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:09,700
The friends here

3673
03:21:09,700 --> 03:21:10,700
Really I

3674
03:21:10,700 --> 03:21:11,700
It's just for the time being.

3675
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:13,700
Zayn

3676
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:16,700
I feel like a son or daughter to you.

3677
03:21:16,700 --> 03:21:22,700
Only one person was different

3678
03:21:22,700 --> 03:21:25,700
Since they share the same father

3679
03:21:25,700 --> 03:21:28,700
One as a father

3680
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:30,700
Mud and Stars

3681
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:31,700
University

3682
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:32,700
A work ticket

3683
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:33,700
As a friend

3684
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:34,700
from now on

3685
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:35,700
At the Shibutoku Musical

3686
03:21:35,700 --> 03:21:37,700
I want to survive

3687
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:43,700
Truly amazing

3688
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:45,700
Two sons

3689
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:46,700
Like this

3690
03:21:46,700 --> 03:21:48,700
I can have it

3691
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:49,700
A little bit today

3692
03:21:49,700 --> 03:21:50,700
You might be watching from anywhere

3693
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:51,700
Also serving

3694
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:52,700
As a son

3695
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:54,700
Nice to meet you

3696
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:55,700
Truly amazing

3697
03:21:55,700 --> 03:21:56,700
Yesterday

3698
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:57,700
As a father

3699
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:58,700
I was able to participate

3700
03:21:58,700 --> 03:21:59,700
Hello everyone

3701
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:01,700
If you have any worries

3702
03:22:01,700 --> 03:22:02,700
Finally

3703
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:03,700
What is it?

3704
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:04,700
Within myself

3705
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:06,700
It's all connected

3706
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:08,700
That it all has meaning

3707
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:09,700
a little bit

3708
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:10,700
If you think so

3709
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:11,700
surely

3710
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:12,700
Beyond that

3711
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:13,700
There is light

3712
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:14,700
There are stars

3713
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:15,700
If you think so

3714
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:17,700
I think it's that kind of work.

3715
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:18,700
thank you

3716
03:22:26,700 --> 03:22:27,700
Well then

3717
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:28,700
I will do my best

3718
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:40,700
Where should I start?

3719
03:22:40,700 --> 03:22:41,700
Already

3720
03:22:47,700 --> 03:22:48,700
But anyway

3721
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:56,700
I'm glad we met

3722
03:22:56,700 --> 03:22:58,700
Hotz

3723
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:08,700
We

3724
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,700
Entertainment and

3725
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:11,700
I'm trying not to

3726
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:14,700
Sometimes after all

3727
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:15,700
There are times when it's difficult

3728
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:23,700
There are times when it's scary

3729
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,700
but

3730
03:23:25,700 --> 03:23:27,700
The Minister just said

3731
03:23:27,700 --> 03:23:28,700
As you said

3732
03:23:28,700 --> 03:23:29,700
Something

3733
03:23:29,700 --> 03:23:30,700
In the purely literal sense

3734
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:32,700
Don't do it right away

3735
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:35,700
In the truest sense

3736
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:36,700
Do it now

3737
03:23:36,700 --> 03:23:38,700
That's what it means

3738
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:41,700
I am this

3739
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:43,700
I felt it at Campari.

3740
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:45,700
of course

3741
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:52,700
A lot of things happened

3742
03:23:52,700 --> 03:23:53,700
Something like that

3743
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:57,700
Only in those words

3744
03:23:57,700 --> 03:23:59,700
I might not be able to tell you right now, but

3745
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:02,700
And more

3746
03:24:02,700 --> 03:24:03,700
I

3747
03:24:03,700 --> 03:24:04,700
now

3748
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:08,700
As a treasure

3749
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:10,700
I was able to have

3750
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:11,700
Above all

3751
03:24:11,700 --> 03:24:12,700
It

3752
03:24:12,700 --> 03:24:13,700
so

3753
03:24:15,700 --> 03:24:16,700
lots of

3754
03:24:18,700 --> 03:24:20,700
To humans

3755
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:28,700
That you can enjoy it

3756
03:24:28,700 --> 03:24:29,700
After all, it's ours

3757
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:31,700
It's the happiest thing

3758
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,700
It

3759
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:34,700
With this member

3760
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:36,700
It can be closed on paper

3761
03:24:36,700 --> 03:24:38,700
I am happy

3762
03:24:39,700 --> 03:24:40,700
Women

3763
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:42,700
Giant player fun

3764
03:24:42,700 --> 03:24:44,700
I welcomed

3765
03:24:46,700 --> 03:24:47,700
My father just now

3766
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:49,700
As you said

3767
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:51,700
We will continue to do so

3768
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:53,700
Look forward

3769
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:54,700
Surely soon

3770
03:24:54,700 --> 03:24:56,700
Each on their own path

3771
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:57,700
Various expressions

3772
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:01,700
I think I'll pursue it

3773
03:25:02,700 --> 03:25:03,700
Not yet

3774
03:25:04,700 --> 03:25:06,700
It will be useful

3775
03:25:09,700 --> 03:25:10,700
Dad too

3776
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:17,700
Let's definitely meet again

3777
03:25:17,700 --> 03:25:18,700
and

3778
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:20,700
Also this woman

3779
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:22,700
I think it would be a good story if we could meet.

3780
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:27,700
It's all connected

3781
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:32,700
I dream of such a day

3782
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,700
Today is really

3783
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:34,700
To everyone

3784
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:35,700
I want to express my gratitude

3785
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:36,700
everyone

3786
03:25:36,700 --> 03:25:37,700
thank you

3787
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:48,700
amazing

3788
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:49,700
I'll say something good.

3789
03:25:55,700 --> 03:25:58,700
I think Bappy will decide.

3790
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:00,700
thank you

3791
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:02,700
Woman

3792
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:03,700
I pushed the woman down.

3793
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:04,700
This is Arisa Shotaro

3794
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:09,700
everyone

3795
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:10,700
Really

3796
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:13,700
Those who noticed

3797
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:14,700
I don't know, but

3798
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,700
I

3799
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:18,700
Because I'm this kind of person

3800
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:20,700
Even if I stand in the middle

3801
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:22,700
After all, everyone

3802
03:26:22,700 --> 03:26:23,700
Many people

3803
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:25,700
For holding me and supporting me

3804
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:26,700
already

3805
03:26:27,700 --> 03:26:28,700
Warm

3806
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:30,700
Someone like my older brother

3807
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:31,700
He was already a family man

3808
03:26:31,700 --> 03:26:32,700
People like

3809
03:26:32,700 --> 03:26:33,700
Because that's fine for you

3810
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:35,700
You can go with that humanity

3811
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:36,700
Just those words are enough

3812
03:26:36,700 --> 03:26:38,700
I really have come this far

3813
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:40,700
But still

3814
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:42,700
When I look around,

3815
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:44,700
After all, this time everyone

3816
03:26:45,700 --> 03:26:46,700
After all

3817
03:26:46,700 --> 03:26:48,700
Cress

3818
03:26:48,700 --> 03:26:50,700
I've seen your face after all

3819
03:26:50,700 --> 03:26:51,700
Really everyone

3820
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:52,700
too

3821
03:26:52,700 --> 03:26:54,700
After all, the curtain won't open

3822
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:57,700
There were many things that caused me anxiety.

3823
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:58,700
I think there is.

3824
03:26:58,700 --> 03:26:59,700
That voice also reached me

3825
03:26:59,700 --> 03:27:01,700
It arrived directly after all

3826
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:04,700
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3827
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:06,700
What's going on?

3828
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:08,700
Ride and enjoy

3829
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:09,700
There are various messages

3830
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:11,700
I saw the power of seeing.

3831
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:12,700
just

3832
03:27:12,700 --> 03:27:14,700
I

3833
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:17,700
I really believe in everyone

3834
03:27:18,700 --> 03:27:19,700
I'm working hard here

3835
03:27:19,700 --> 03:27:20,700
Because I've been watching everyone

3836
03:27:22,700 --> 03:27:24,700
Watch it.

3837
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:25,700
Feelings

3838
03:27:26,700 --> 03:27:28,700
I just want you to wear it

3839
03:27:28,700 --> 03:27:30,700
That's really the only feeling

3840
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:32,700
Not

3841
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,700
Together

3842
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:35,200
There are so many different

3843
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:36,700
Overcoming a big wall

3844
03:27:36,700 --> 03:27:37,700
already

3845
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:39,700
Even if the conversation doesn't change

3846
03:27:39,700 --> 03:27:40,700
Invisible

3847
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:42,700
It's a bond

3848
03:27:42,700 --> 03:27:43,700
That's already the case

3849
03:27:43,700 --> 03:27:44,700
Don don don don

3850
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:46,700
That means we're connected

3851
03:27:46,700 --> 03:27:48,700
I've been feeling this trend for a long time now

3852
03:27:49,700 --> 03:27:50,700
After all

3853
03:27:50,700 --> 03:27:51,700
Makuha is open

3854
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:53,700
Jonah Joshi's

3855
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:55,700
What is the other Yuya-san?

3856
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:57,700
Really

3857
03:27:57,700 --> 03:28:00,700
We've talked about a lot of things up until today

3858
03:28:00,700 --> 03:28:02,700
Yesterday's Yuya's war loss

3859
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:04,700
Watching Hiro's wartime success

3860
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:06,700
After all,

3861
03:28:06,700 --> 03:28:08,700
There was today

3862
03:28:09,700 --> 03:28:10,700
One more

3863
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:13,700
I feel like I've really completed it.

3864
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:15,700
I got into the mood.

3865
03:28:15,700 --> 03:28:18,700
I've seen some really amazing things

3866
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:19,700
on second thoughts

3867
03:28:19,700 --> 03:28:20,700
I'm glad I worked hard

3868
03:28:20,700 --> 03:28:21,700
Really already

3869
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,700
As of yesterday, I felt

3870
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:24,700
So today, everyone

3871
03:28:24,700 --> 03:28:25,700
so

3872
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:27,700
I can see that face in Chi-up

3873
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:29,700
Really I

3874
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:31,700
With a heartfelt joy

3875
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:32,700
There are lots

3876
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:34,700
As it was at the beginning

3877
03:28:34,700 --> 03:28:35,700
I

3878
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:38,700
I think it's a historic evolution.

3879
03:28:38,700 --> 03:28:39,700
To the world

3880
03:28:39,700 --> 03:28:40,700
Really already

3881
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:42,700
We all worked hard to create it

3882
03:28:42,700 --> 03:28:43,700
already

3883
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:45,700
This guy

3884
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:46,700
This guy gave it to me in the field.

3885
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:47,700
Together

3886
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:48,700
I want to keep up

3887
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:49,700
already

3888
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:50,700
try as hard as one can

3889
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:51,700
Climb, climb, climb, climb up the mountain

3890
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:53,700
today

3891
03:28:53,700 --> 03:28:54,700
Really

3892
03:28:54,700 --> 03:28:56,700
I think I was able to make everyone happy.

3893
03:28:56,700 --> 03:28:57,700
Thank you so much

3894
03:29:07,700 --> 03:29:09,700
Me too

3895
03:29:09,700 --> 03:29:10,700
Really

3896
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:12,700
I spoke without thinking

3897
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:13,700
Maybe

3898
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:14,700
no

3899
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:15,700
That's not true

3900
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:18,700
Some people may think that

3901
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:20,700
This is definitely

3902
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:21,700
already

3903
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:22,700
It's my feelings

3904
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:24,700
Campari's feelings

3905
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:25,700
I

3906
03:29:25,700 --> 03:29:26,700
today

3907
03:29:26,700 --> 03:29:28,700
It may be a mistake

3908
03:29:28,700 --> 03:29:30,700
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3909
03:29:39,700 --> 03:29:41,700
It's okay to think that

3910
03:29:43,700 --> 03:29:45,700
Me too

3911
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:50,700
Me too

3912
03:29:50,700 --> 03:29:57,700
where

3913
03:29:57,700 --> 03:30:01,700
Me too

3914
03:30:04,700 --> 03:30:06,700
Everyone did their best.

3915
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:10,700
everyone

3916
03:30:10,700 --> 03:30:12,700
everyone

3917
03:30:12,700 --> 03:30:14,700
everyone

3918
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:16,700
thank you

3919
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:31,700
I

3920
03:30:31,700 --> 03:30:33,700
To dry this

3921
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:35,700
Also

3922
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:51,700
I hope that I will be able to meet you all in person soon. I also hope that this work will continue to remain not only in Japan, but all over the world.

3923
03:30:55,700 --> 03:30:59,700
I want to teach with big dreams.

3924
03:31:00,700 --> 03:31:02,700
Thank you very much.

3925
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:13,700
So, I hope to finish it again soon, and thank you for watching today.

3926
03:31:29,700 --> 03:31:33,700
Thank you for watching.

3927
03:31:59,700 --> 03:32:03,700
Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

3935

Thank you for watching.

3936
03:35:54,700 --> 03:35:57,700
Everyone, everyone and a little bit of everyone.

3937
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:03,700
Because there are a lot of things going on.

3938
03:36:06,700 --> 03:36:10,700
Thank you everyone!

3939
03:36:11,700 --> 03:36:13,700
Thank you for watching.

3940

Thank you for watching.
