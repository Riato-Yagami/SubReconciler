1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:48,000
hard

2
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is also on screen and can be spoken about.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's okay. It's okay.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are watching this.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, you guys.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You have been chosen.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I decided it was trustworthy.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I leave this record to those who will carry on my legacy.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now I'm heading to the ruins in Mexico.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Time that had stopped for 49 years has begun to move again.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's why now.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This record must be kept.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If something happens to my eyes in the future.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, let's get back to the topic.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As you all know,

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This Foundation is a sub-structure of humanity,

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Medicine, government studies, high school studies, etc.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It was established with the aim of bringing women into various fields.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's your mood?

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, that's the impression.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please listen carefully.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I founded this foundation here in the United States.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All the things that steal Shiv from the world,

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It is like discovering the secret of something.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That thing is a stone screen.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The mood is,

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The mood is,

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The mood is,

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The mood is,

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Foundation's purpose in death,

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That is to do the secret of the stone screen.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And today, I am recording this.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A story awaits behind the mask,

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And there it was,

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The story of the spirit of radish,

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is so that they can follow the lead.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It all started with the 16th generation.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A part of the central park of the purpose formula.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
For tiles that can hear the voice of time,

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
About once in Afteka.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Dear Osamu,

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dear Osamu,

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dear Osamu,

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dear Osamu,

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Blessed man,

46
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The power of life,

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The power of life,

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The power of life,

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The insects are afraid,

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Appearance.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When will it be time to breathe history?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The spirit dances with power

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We are sunlight and sweat

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I sweat twice as much in the sun

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Widespread

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But at one point, the department was replaced by Kotzentos.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All of that and more are in the Stone Mask.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,500
This story awaits in the Stone Mask

59
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,000
The two are the boy's favorite fateful adventure

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,500
To do this, first

61
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,500
1868 Years Old Ronto's son

62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Watcher!

63
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
It's Ikeame

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
I won't leave again

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I have to apologize for doing it

66
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll finish you up, Ikeri

67
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Today is

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm sleepy

69
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I don't understand the sun

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Who is it?

71
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Isn't it the birther who is the self?

72
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Everyone's still gathered

73
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
It's coming

74
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
The first person will go

75
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
wait a minute

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Okay tease

77
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
hang on

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Hurry, hurry

79
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Wooooooooooooo!

80
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
That's more than that

81
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm sorry for not being friendly with you

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,940
It's a rich man, it's a fast one, so I'm going to look for him.

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Wow, that was fast.

85
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,420
It's a beautiful necklace. Thank you.

86
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh, it's in this box. It's the next best thing.

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,700
What is this? It's your bad wall. I don't need this.

88
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Come on, come on, my head is still alive

89
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't want to get into that kind of trouble, I'll find something valuable.

90
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,900
The valuables are gone, Yuriya and I are scared

91
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,900
It's a hole in the hand of a certain person's house. It's a hole in the hand of a certain person's house.

92
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
Look, find it

93
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Just one night

94
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,300
No thanks

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,900
Brother, do you believe me? What were you doing?

96
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,300
I won't see you

97
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,900
Passion

98
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,220
Oge

99
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,200
Did you buy it?

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,140
People who like hot weather have it.

101
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,120
He was trying to calm me down.

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
What about Red?

103
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
Morning

104
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,380
I helped

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,180
Is this also a dream?

106
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,060
Race saved my life

107
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,260
My name is

108
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,300
Used

109
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,320
This treasure must never be attacked.

110
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,980
Naroruhodoromonchya, no offense, but Brand!

111
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,780
Ah, Dario, beat Brando!

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,140
Time passed, and in 1880

113
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,960
The time was filled with enthusiasm

114
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,520
Let's talk, it's terrible

115
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm getting on well

116
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
People were dreaming

117
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,020
Now is a great time to go to college

118
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,520
Take him in your hands

119
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,620
People were reaching out

120
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,500
The park I went back to the other day with a super stick

121
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,060
I don't watch it, but it's out of date

122
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,520
When will ordinary darkness come, I'm waiting

123
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,580
That voice, even

124
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,020
A suspicious voice

125
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,160
Come on, find out who I am

126
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,360
Press the middle button and listen carefully

127
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,680
Let me explain

128
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360

00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,080
While leaving it to high school students

133
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,580
I'd like to tell you guys too.

134
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,020
To the people, to this country, to Basa, to this era

135
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,000
This will also tell you what is happening

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,040
Now in this country, Basa, in this era

137

Let me teach you more about Pee's

138
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,400
Now, let's finish with the second pass.

139

141
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,900
This is so nostalgic

142
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,140
Color is important

It was a nightmare, but it didn't work

157

00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm really going to do it!

193
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,740
Go!

194
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
nice!

195
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Let's do it!

196
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
This idiot

197
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
oh!

198
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,740
At this level, the arrow of life is returned!

199
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
I can't breathe after I collapsed!

200
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,740
White mountain.

201
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,820
Yours is the best

202
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,280
I don't want that to happen!

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Masseuse in the front

204
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,200
It would have been better if they had sold it.

205
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh no!

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,100
Oh no!

207
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,100
I can't hear you!

208
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh no!

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
What's wrong?

210
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,300
a

211
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,040
a

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Medicine

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
The medicine is now

214
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
I have something important to tell you. Are you here?

215
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,880
Oh no

216
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,140
I've been here for a long time now

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,240
I know

218
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
Hey

219
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,580
Since I disappeared as a new

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
All I care about is you

221
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,500
Ah, so that's it.

222
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,740
Oh, I'm getting this

223
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,500
Oh, dear dear dear dear

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,180
Ah, the good one

225
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,300
It's a rule

226
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Moreover, it's a human

227
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,460
That's what I have ongar

228
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,260
Okay?

229
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,660
When I die, send him that letter. Go to him.

230
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Go to that guy

231
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,620
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

232
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
It's a surprise to the school

233
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,140
That's nice

234
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,100
It can be stuck even if you cut it properly.

235
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
investigation

236
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,340
Now, the father is being rude

237
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,740
Okay, Dio

238
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,900
You have good balls

239
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,260
Seriously to no one

240
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,900
Become the richest

241
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Dio

242
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,340
Father and grandparents

243
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,540
Ask yourself

244
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,780
Stolen

245
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,020
Keep going

246
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,540
That's right

247
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,740
Unbeatable

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,460
I feel nauseous

249
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,900
It's hell now

250
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,500
Hakie wo Moyoko

251
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Even so, it was my mother's translation

252
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,900
Let go of your pride

253
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,260
He hugged me

254
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,620
Nedio

255
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,100
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

256
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,220
My mother kept saying that

257
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,820
It was terrible and he died.

258
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,060
openly

259
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,140
Why don't you have anything in your hands?

260
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Not only will it be stolen

261
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,460
What a star

262
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,300
Do you have it?

263
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,980
Is that sky blue?

264
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,500
It happened

265
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:30,900
Blowing in my ears

266
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,940
The worst father

267
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,500
Not losing has always been losing

268
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,660
Under this cloudy sky

269
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,940
I was already running and dying

270
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:58,020
Let's receive Issan now

271
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,580
Use all

272
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:07,140
I think it's a crossover

273
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:13,220
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

274
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,380
Let's start there

275
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,300
It happened

276
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,140
You have it

277
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:33,620
Boredom in that sky

278
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,300
That's it.

279
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,320
Usually

280
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,420
Just a Star

281
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,700
Come on, I already have some good ones

282
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Come on, I heard your family trades in medicine for your wife.

283
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
My father is a proper doctor.

284
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I don't know. But the high stars.

285
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh, stop, your mother gave that to you on a single sheet too.

286
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
Do it!

287
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,300
What are you doing?! Take this!

288
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Oh, do it!

289
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Don't act all high and mighty just because you're in front of my house.

290
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Hey, is anyone doing this?

291
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It's Jouster Keljouna.

292
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,300
More copy and copy parts under the eyes.

293
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,300
After all, this is Jouna from Jousterkel!

294
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,300
It's Kanemochiki Day for both of us!

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
what?

296
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Dear breakfast!

297
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Um, are you okay?

298
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Leave me alone.

299
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
It was something I wanted to do.

300
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,300
I didn't do it to be thanked by you.

301
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,300
I'm aiming for true passion.

302
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
You were a girl and it was a problem.

303
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,300
So I just stood up.

304
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Someday you'll be able to win.

305
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Okay, let's go!

306
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
Ah, wait a minute!

307
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Jona-san Jowstar.

308
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Okay, let's go!

309
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Hey, Dani!

310
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,300
You...

311
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
You're Diopransola!

312
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,300
That's you, Jona-san Jouster.

313
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Everyone calls her Chocho.

314
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Looking forward to working with you.

315
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
This is my friend Danny.

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Let's go.

317
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
It's okay because it won't sag or fall off.

318
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
friend?

319
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Danny!

320
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
What are you doing?

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Gyul-san!

322
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I've been waiting for you, Diopland.

323
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
Enter Jowstar today.

324
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
This is the haven where you will live from today onwards.

325
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
What's wrong, Jojo?

326
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
You must be tired from London, Dio.

327
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
From today you are our family.

328
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Maybe you could live your life like Jojo.

329
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Jowstar, thank you for your service today.

330
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
BLADDOG!

331
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
It's the Cape Archer!

332
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
police?

333
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Is something wrong?

334
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
The Jowstar movement is a long-standing friendship.

335
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,300
I heard Danny cry just now.

336
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
That was sudden!

337
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
The surprising display hit my leg.

338
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Danny is an excellent selling point for the Jowstar line.

339
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,300
He's quite friendly, but it was great that he surprised you.

340
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,300
JoJo, I'm already happy with Danny.

341
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Jojo also lost his mother.

342
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
It's a year like that.

343
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
Please get along well with each other.

344
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Now, let me show you to your room.

345
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
BLADDOG!

346
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
JoJo!

347
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
See you, JoJo!

348
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,300
JoJo!

349
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,300
So, this is my Geass game!

350
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Don't touch my bag.

351
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm driving.

352
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,300
Well, your hands are sticky like a dog's.

353
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Sorry, but I don't want you to touch it.

354
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
Listen, JoJo.

355
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,300
First up is Number One, my favorite.

356
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,300
No matter who it is, I won't let anyone act arrogantly in front of me.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I just try to be friendly.

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,300
What are you both doing?

359
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
One more thing.

360
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I hate dogs.

361
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,300
They are trying to curry favor with humanity and ignore their enemies.

362
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Don't let that Ahoina get close to me.

363
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I'll get to work on the jaw now.

364
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Thus, the two proofs met and the two players began.

365
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,300
Hitaka Jojo.

366
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,300
Dioc.

367
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Okay?

368
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,380
I aye raa

369
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:29,660
A little dancing,

370
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Still no good, get it on your hands.

371
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Why is it just one day?

372
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,660
To prevent us from connecting with each other

373
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Wait and see next time

374
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,660
No matter what, I want to do it to you

375
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Being reborn and illuminating

376
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Please, head to the waiting room.

377
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
How many times has this happened?

378
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
This is the sixth time

379
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,660
All of the answers are correct.

380
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
Because I liked reading books

381
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
This much

382
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,660
It's still not easy to play,

383
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Ikane

384
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
We are

385
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Here as a high memory

386
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
real

387
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,660
Check it out

388
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,660
That's not enough

389
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,660
Pesh thing

390
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I almost believe

391
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Don't do horsetail

392
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
Nothing is always

393
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
Without passing by the beauty

394
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Wait and see next time

395
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Whatever happens

396
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
To be loved

397
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Really high

398
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Azukasa

399
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
a little bit

400
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
nevertheless

401
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
Do you believe it?

402
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
Look at it

403
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
I'll tell you

404
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,660
Perfect supporter

405
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Shockley, too.

406
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Aventine

407
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,660
That's it

408
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Riwo

409
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I don't see it

410
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
I

411
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
Embarrassing

412
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,660
You

413
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,660
I was spoiled

414
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
Such

415
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
My mother gave it to me.

416
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,660
always

417
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Correct the festival

418
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Ikane

419
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
We are

420
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Were you born?

421
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
As a memory

422
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
Philosophy

423
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
However,

424
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
The exit

425
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Always in mind

426
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
This is transmitted to England

427
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
There are two models

428
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
One day

429
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Their master

430
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
By the enemy

431
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Captive

432
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
It became

433
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,660
The enemy is

434
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Huge power

435
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
have

436
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
The two models

437
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
fear

438
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,660
I put forward the conditions

439
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Instead

440
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,660
You guys

441
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Once menarche occurs

442
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
At one time

443
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Life is

444
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,660
To try to guarantee

445
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
where

446
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
To the two of them

447
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
It's a problem

448
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
yes

449
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
To save my master

450
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Offer yourself

451
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
Captive

452
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,660
It became

453
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
The stars?

454
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
Corridor

455
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Railway City

456
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
First

457
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
What I'm looking at

458
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
In front of me

459
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Will it be a draw?

460
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
Or

461
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
On the diagram

462
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Shine

463
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
want

464
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,660
I wonder

465
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Which one?

466
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
think

467
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
I wanted

468
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Draw?

469
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I

470
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Draw

471
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I was watching

472
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
I think

473
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Why

474
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,660
I think so

475
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
in the end

476
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
They have

477
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
For the Lord

478
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Death unexpectedly

479
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,660
There is no choice

480
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
If I die,

481
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
There's nothing to be done

482
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
you can't

483
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
that's why

484
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
no matter how

485
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Even if you put down the work

486
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
Alive

487
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Something

488
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Nasaneba and

489
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
I thought

490
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
I

491
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
I was looking at the stars

492
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
I think

493
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
They lost their lives

494
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
Two people

495
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
It's a kiss

496
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
In history

497
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
It will be engraved

498
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
So

499
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
So

500
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
How did you live?

501
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
How it happened

502
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Cherish it

503
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
in the end

504
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
They

505
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Himself

506
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
Nothing in hand

507
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Not included

508
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
the

509
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,660
解鋼

510
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Helplessness

511
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
They

512
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
What I saw

513
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
It's a draw

514
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
They

515
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Teaching

516
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Alive

517
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
What

518
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
this

519
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
He was proud

520
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
I was looking at the stars

521
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
That's how we should live

522
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
He is teaching me

523
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Thank you

524
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
you

525
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
It's a rule

526
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
It's a thing

527
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
Take it away

528
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
I'm alive

529
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,660
If so

530
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
To fulfill that responsibility

531
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Alive

532
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
What to do

533
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
Shouldn't you think about it?

534
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
I

535
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Both of them

536
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,660
That far

537
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
At this time

538
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
There is no right answer

539
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
Is that okay?

540
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
People

541
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660

live

543
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,660
So

544
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Reach out

545
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660

Both

What do you think?

623
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,660
Let's do it!

624
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
If Gru sees Bastiv on the screen, he's defeated!

625
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,660
With this rail, it keeps coming out!

626
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
It's Hong!

627
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
It's Feeket!

628
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Yay!

629
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
Nodknocky!

630
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,660
I've never seen that before!

631
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,660
It's a washer!

632
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Ah...

633
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
thing!

634
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,660
Y-y-y-take ra!

635
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Feeket!?

636
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Hey, how are you?

637
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
D ص PAR!

638
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Ichikowa

639
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Everyone! Everyone!

640
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My finger seems to have landed in his eye.

641
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,360
It was a foul on my part.

642
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,740
It's all about sharing ideas, it's boring!

643
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,220
Wow, that was amazing! I'm going to do that move!

644
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,540
So why don't you stop!

645
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,900
Hubber, everyone!

646
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:38,660
For some reason, Dio is trying to get me to fall for him.

647
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,660
I feel like I'm being trusted more and more

648
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:52,660
I want to see your heart when you sleep

649
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,660
I'm full of anxiety

650
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,660
If I continue to trust you like this

651
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,660
Will everyone cry?

652
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,660
You are always warm

653
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Thank you for being by my side

654
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:30,660
If I had a mother, would it be like this?

655
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Is this how you loved me?

656
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,660
You were in trouble

657
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:59,660
My half

658
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Hey, what's the flower pressure?

659
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,660
I'll be here in the morning too

660
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,660
If you'd like, come too.

661
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,660
Are you curious?

662
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,660
Sorry for touching you without permission.

663
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
I don't care

664
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,660
The stone screen was apparently excavated from Mekishiko Stone.

665
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,660
Mekishiko

666
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,660
When girls were just born

667
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,660
I bought it at the London Art Museum.

668
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,660
On the way back, I had an accident at the location.

669
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,660
It was when your father helped me.

670
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Are you interested?

671
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,660
Aie, nothing in particular

672
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,660
that

673
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,660
The girls always go out with Danny.

674
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Danny's attitude towards women

675
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,660
There's friendship and trust

676
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Friendship Is it a dog?

677
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Danny was a young girl

678
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,660
I won it.

679
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
At first I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.

680
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,660
It didn't go well with either girl.

681
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
But one day

682
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,660
A woman once woke up in the river

683
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,660
My voice is all alone and no one can hear it

684
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Just as I die

685
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,660
The way he listened to the princess was one thing.

686
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Danny jumped into the river.

687
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Danny jumps into the river

688
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,660
I saved a girl's life.

689
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,660
I know what life is

690
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,660
Danny's spirited actions

691
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
A young woman

692
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Danny's feelings

693
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,660
I was moved

694
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Since then they

695
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,660
That's why I have great confidence in him.

696
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660
is that so

697
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
Dangaso too

698
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
ah

699
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
it was

700
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Believe

701
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Butterfly

702
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
The two resumed

703
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
love

704
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
That wonderful effect

705
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
I took a few actions.

706
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
The two who are waiting to win

707
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,660
I was in love

708
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,660
Danny

709
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Be well behaved

710
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,660
You eat in separate scenes

711
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,660
What are you digging up from the top of your sister's neck?

712
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
no

713
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Nothing

714
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
Why hide it?

715
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
If you say so, I really want to see it

716
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
You'll laugh

717
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
I won't laugh

718
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
I'll tell someone

719
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
I won't laugh, so show me

720
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,660
No.

721
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,660
butterfly

722
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
Elina

723
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,660
Just call

724
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Feelings

725
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,660
Relax

726
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,660
What kind of music

727
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
The sound

728
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
I'm falling in love

729
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,660
What's going well

730
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,660
already

731
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Laugh like that

732
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Morning or quite

733
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
Bab

734
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,660
The sky gets higher

735
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Elina

736
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,660
butterfly

737
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,660
The happiness of being there

738
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,660
The clouds are heartfelt

739
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,660
The wind is a little sweet

740
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
butterfly

741
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,660
Elina

742
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm short of words

743
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,660
This one

744
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,660
Overflowing

745
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,660
forever

746
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
One word

747
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
I'm happy

748
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,660
I want to hear

749
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
With your voice

750
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Here

751
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,660
tickles

752
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,660
you

753
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,660
People who can't hear

754
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,660
I don't know

755
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,660
I'm being asked by you

756
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,660
Put on Jariun

757
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,660
The reason for the two of us

758
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,660
Hands and

759
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
My hands

760
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,660
Touching

761
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,660
be confused

762
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Towards tomorrow

763
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
To be continued

764
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,660
This little courage

765
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Trembling

766
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Red ringing

767
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
surely

768
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
compete

769
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Hawatsu

770
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,660
Preconceived notions

771
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
It's already this late

772
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
Because a customer is coming today

773
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
I have to hurry back

774
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Elina

775
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
see you tomorrow

776
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Huh, okay?

777
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Huh

778
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,660
compete

779
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Suyoku

780
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
you

781
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,660
That name is

782
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Isn't that right?

783
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,660
here we go

784
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Ugh

785
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Ugh

786
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Ugh

787
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
Ugh

788
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,660
It's Erina Pendleton.

789
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Today is

790
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
With my superior

791
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
They were just playing

792
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
that

793
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
something

794
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
wall

795
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Ugh

796
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Ugh

797
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Ugh

798
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Ugh

799
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Ugh

800
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
Ugh

801
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
Ugh

802
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
Ugh

803
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Ugh

804
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Ugh

805
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,660
Ugh

806
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Ugh

807
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Ugh

808
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,660
Ugh

809
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Udo Yaa

810
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,660
here we go

811
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
Cling

812
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
today

813
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
What can't be done on broken ground

814
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
Do a transformation and get out

815
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
I can see it locked there

816
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,660
Wait, have you kissed me yet?

817
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Not yet

818
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
My first partner is not Chojo

819
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
This is Dio

820
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,660
If it's ratey, what does that mean?

821
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,660
You understand, right?

822
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,660
This guy!

823
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,660
This woman!

824
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,660
Are you saying soroagaarau on purpose?

825
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
Wow!

826
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
What's going on?

827
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
Why are you giving me alcohol?

828
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,660
Who is responsible for Peter's food shortage?

829
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
Namaruka

830
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
yes

831
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Because I can't win now

832
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Why would you bother to say that?

833
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,660
What's the big sale?

834
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Kanaki Koiyori

835
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,660
Please give me an illustration that doesn't look like a kaza.

836
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
It's no good if you eat well

837
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,520
I've been seen before, I'm a useless man

838
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,640
Izawa Hiamatress

839
00:41:45,640 --> 00:42:07,860
宙zech

840
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,860
You go buy some alcohol

841
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Already money

842
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Eni

843
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
The alcoholic beverages have arrived.

844
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,860
So the name is scary and I guess

845
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,860
at least

846
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Eat money to buy medicine

847
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Your mouth is big

848
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,860
How long will I remain?

849
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,860
I thought he was shy, but

850
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Magara

851
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Crack

852
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Well, my breasts are always twisted and swaying.

853
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
I noticed it too early and stepped on it

854
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Yes, it's Joes.

855
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,860
If you see a hand

856
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
Follow

857
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
I am

858
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
With you

859
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Haa

860
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,860
Haa

861
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,860
Haa

862
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
Haa

863
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Haa

864
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,860
Haa

865
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Haa

866
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Haa

867
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Haa

868
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
Why is this happening today?

869
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,860
Hurt her

870
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
Haa

871
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
I want to go

872
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,860
What did you do?

873
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Why?

874
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Oh

875
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Haa

876
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,860
You are amazing

877
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Much more than me

878
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,860
I respect that.

879
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Only in my heart

880
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860
One thing is for sure

881
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,860
There is something burning

882
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860
Oh no

883
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,860
Haa

884
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,860
Many people's names

885
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,860
Easy to wear

886
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,860
A small person

887
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
I heard that

888
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
My love

889
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,860
you

890
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Kyusana

891
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860
I'm the one

892
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,860
I don't care

893
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,860
nine

894
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,860
Haa

895
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Haa

896
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
Haa

897
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,860
Stand up to it

898
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,860
No shoulders

899
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,860
this

900
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
I can't lose

901
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Oh

902
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
Emotions

903
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,860
Dominate

904
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,860
Not like him

905
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
Slippery Heart

906
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,860
Her name

907
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,860
Get it back

908
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Oh no

909
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Generation rate

910
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Battle

911
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,860
I'll make you understand

912
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,860
Oh no

913
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
Haa

914
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,860
you

915
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,860
I miss you

916
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Get to know

917
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,860
That's a good impression.

918
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
Haa

919
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
Haa

920
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,860
Haa

921
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,860
Haa

922
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Haa

923
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Haa

924
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Haa

925
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
This heart

926
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
You

927
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
Give it to me

928
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
Only

929
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Oh no

930
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
You

931
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
You

932
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,860
Until Naku

933
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
like this

934
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,860
Lost

935
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,860
Don't bend

936
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,860
Haa

937
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,860
Haa

938
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Haa

939
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,860
Haa

940
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,860
often

941
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,860
too

942
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,860
To me

943
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Bukase

944
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
surely

945
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,860
Konoha

946
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Better

947
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,860
Like this

948
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,860
Like winning

949
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,860
Cheap

950
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,860
This me

951
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,860
this

952
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,860
Looks good on you

953
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Like this

954
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Like winning

955
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,860
Cheap

956
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,860
This me

957
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
This suits you

958
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,860
Haa

959
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Haa

960
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
One

961
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,860
What's going on?

962
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
Both of them

963
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,860
Give a penalty

964
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,860
Go back to your room

965
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Haa

966
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,860
Haa

967
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Haa

Haa

976
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Haa

977
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Haa

978
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
Haa

979
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
Haa

980
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Haa

981
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Haa

Haa

985
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Haa

986
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Haa

987
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,860
Haa

988
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,860
Haa

989
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Haa

990
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,860
Haa

991
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Haa

992
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
Haa

993
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
Haa

994
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Haa

995
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Haa

996
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
Haa

997
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,860
Haa

998
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,860
Haa

999
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Haa

1000
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,860
Haa

1001
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Haa

1002
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Haa

1003
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,860
Haa

1004
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
Haa

1005
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
Haa

1006
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,860
Haa

1007
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,360
Haa

1008
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Let's go, we'll make friends over there too.

1009
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,360
He looked down on women.

1010
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,360
His explosive power

1011
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:43,360
I need to develop that mental strength even more.

1012
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,360
So that I can hold my head high in faith

1013
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:53,360
I need to calm down and control my mind more.

1014
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,360
To get it all

1015
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
But

1016
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
What's that sound?

1017
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Is there anyone in honesty?

1018
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Are you going to try to go outside?

1019
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Oh my god

1020
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,360
Someone please

1021
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Hmm

1022
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Then Pan Seventies

1023
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
First place

1024
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
Bistriest

1025
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Ride behind

1026
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,360
Aprekaeru Korori

1027
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,360
What about artificial?

1028
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Timekeeper Piakorak is a building star

1029
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
No one can stop us

1030
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
Cake Rosie in the Flow

1031
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Melting Up Ten

1032
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Listening to British culture

1033
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Chaochao

1034
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Wartwack Osaka

1035
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Top Runner

1036
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Cattrell Dawser

1037
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Rowan peas on index finger

1038
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
I'm sleeping

1039
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Port Levy

1040
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
A bright and cheerful team

1041
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,360
Same as the current situation in Maldea

1042
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Focusing on the darkness

1043
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,360
It feels like it's shaking

1044
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,360
That's Portobello

1045
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Port's own market

1046
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
Is that correct?

1047
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Stone Turtle

1048
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Excavated in Mexico

1049
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
I think it was Mexico

1050
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
It's been a long time

1051
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
It was a while ago.

1052
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
You made it clear

1053
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
But there's no doubt about it

1054
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
The wife of the late Soroshinshi

1055
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I hate it

1056
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
I got it back after a good run.

1057
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Okay

1058
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
I did it

1059
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
I bought it

1060
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,360
in

1061
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Where is Soroshinshi now?

1062
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
It seems a bit suspicious

1063
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Generally you

1064
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
What is it?

1065
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,360
This is a gracious

1066
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,360
My name is

1067
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,360
Seteri

1068
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,360
It's a downshake

1069
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,360
By the stone turtle

1070
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,360
I'm from Italy

1071
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,360
All the way from Italy

1072
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,360
Northern rules

1073
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,360
Like I said

1074
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
I'll do some research

1075
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,360
Please wait

1076
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
April

1077
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
Ha

1078
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,360
I'll give you a little China.

1079
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Will the sun soon set?

1080
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,360
You'd better not go beyond that street.

1081
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Kiri appeared

1082
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,360
The sun stops

1083
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,360
Until then

1084
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
When I'm in town

1085
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
topknot

1086
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Please drink it

1087
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,360
I don't know you

1088
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,360
Kiritomo Sky

1089
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,360
Not yet

1090
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,360
chase

1091
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Second-rate

1092
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,360
Reach out your hand

1093
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Voices around

1094
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,360
I don't want to fall

1095
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:39,360
Laughter and no laughter

1096
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,360
Mix it up

1097
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Drinking stops

1098
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,360
Thrown away in the dump

1099
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
Better

1100
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Talking about Autumn

1101
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Legs

1102
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,360
This darkness

1103
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,360
Worth going

1104
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,360
Something's wrong

1105
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,360
I'm sure it's because I'm dry

1106
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,360
Until then

1107
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,360
surely

1108
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,360
Itchy

1109
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,360

1110
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Kisakisa

1111
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,360
Seriously awesome

1112
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,360
Hated and scorned

1113
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Hateful Agebokoe

1114
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,360
Right now

1115
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,360
Immediately

1116
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,360
Magical

1117
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
That's it

1118
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,360
Inagein

1119
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,360

1120
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,360
Save Trafalda Stare

1121
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360
I can hear

1122
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
Iodine

1123
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,360
Shoot

1124
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,360

1125
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,360
From the high party

1126
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,360
The rich

1127
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,360
My eyes still smile

1128
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,360
Kirino

1129
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360

Kobotuya

1135
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,360
The flow also came

1136
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,360
That's it

1137
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
Kut

1138
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,360

1141
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
Trafalda

1142
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Nun

1143
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,360

1144
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,100
Choyo

Red Ant

1147
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
So

1148
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Sasa is

1149
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,600
What is it?

1150
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,360
Woah!

1151
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,360
Hey

1152
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
Oh

1153
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Uuuuu

1154
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,320
Just bring my smile back a little closer

1155
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,200
First delusion

1156
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,260
Dark dark girl

1157
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,280
Ba be rinen

1158
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:41,440
Silence

1159
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,280
Get your mind back

1160
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,500
Recruitment is against

1161
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,500
Night night night night night Shalal ...

1162
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,420
I chose the outfit and it was a hit.

1163
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,840
I want to meet you, that's it

1164
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,580
Just a little

1165
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:03,780
The best thing about bad behavior

1166
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,900
Chochocho Maca's family car

1167
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,060
So it's the last game

1168
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,380
Winning the championship

1169
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,860
a little bit

1170
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,840
It's on the bottom right

1171
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Thanks to your parts

1172
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,680
First, let's tell Dad about this victory.

1173
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Magician's Palace

1174
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Thanks to you

1175
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,140
In the school scene

1176
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,640
Can you tell me about your friendship?

1177
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,640
thank you

1178
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,040
Please change your mind and wait for me

1179
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,540
Let's go home together

1180
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,540
Like water you don't ask for

1181
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Time passed

1182
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,840
You

1183
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
With Dad

1184
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,840
Since I started calling

1185
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
To me

1186
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,340
Those familiar words

1187
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,840
think

1188
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,340
7 years

1189
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,340
Checking your calculations

1190
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,840
You are

1191
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,340
beautifully

1192
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,340
It was believed

1193
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,340
Make my Elio come true

1194
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,340
Friends

1195
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,340
think

1196
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
Elinae's

1197
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,840
Ayamachi

1198
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,340
You are

1199
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,840
I was eating

1200
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,340
Danny's replacement

1201
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,840
You are

1202
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,840
He supported me.

1203
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,840
Ahead of me

1204
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
Your back

1205
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,840
there were

1206
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,840
7 years

1207
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Where

1208
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
walked

1209
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
However

1210
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Why am I

1211
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
To you

1212
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:59,840
I don't feel any friendship

1213
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Thanks to

1214
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
How do you like it

1215
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,840
Just the wind

1216
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,840
If it continues this long

1217
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
teeth

1218
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
I'm getting old

1219
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Not yet

1220
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,840
ah

1221
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
oh yeah

1222
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,840
That's quite something

1223
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Skilled

1224
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
Dioplant

1225
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
they

1226
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
It seems that he won

1227
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:45,840
Dio is already one of Joestarke's

1228
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Joe was Dibbala Singh Singh

1229
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,840
It was a brilliant stop in the field of high school studies.

1230
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Dio-kun is the number one in law.

1231
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
Graduation

1232
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,840
I respect you

1233
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Danda-sama

1234
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,840
I just got home

1235
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Dio is back

1236
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
And Jojo too

1237
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,840
Are you okay, Dad?

1238
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,840
My sanity won't stop

1239
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Today the doctor recommended I be admitted to hospital.

1240
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,840
I'm against it.

1241
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,840
Hospitals these days are all about making money

1242
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,840
Apparently it's a problem in Longbourn too.

1243
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,840
It's definitely safer at home

1244
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
There was a time

1245
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:48,840
The swelling in my hands and the pain in my chest will subside.

1246
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Congratulations to both of you on your wins

1247
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,840
Do you already know?

1248
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,840
Archer Cave there told me.

1249
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,840
I want to hear it.

1250
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Cave

1251
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,840
we

1252
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,840
I just want to see your happy face

1253
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
I could have just stoned it.

1254
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,840
I'm here

1255
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Really big nose

1256
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,840
wonderful

1257
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,840
There are already few

1258
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,840
Especially Dio

1259
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,840
You did really well

1260
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
After the measures

1261
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,840
Be what you want to be

1262
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,840
To me, born of poor origins

1263
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Give it a chance

1264
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,840
thank you

1265
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,840
So I'm going to use this cable.

1266
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
Thank you for always coming.

1267
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
thank you

1268
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
The tip of the cut is exposed.

1269
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,840
It's the sound that has made lies a part of the world.

1270
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,840
No, this is Liverpool.

1271
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,840
anywhere

1272
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Like that guy

1273
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,840
There are people who don't have the full amount.

1274
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
So

1275
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
do

1276
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,840
staff

1277
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,840
It's a living mechanism that responds only to

1278
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Who and for what purpose?

1279
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,840
If we solve this mystery

1280
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,840
Maybe I can make something happen on my way home from here

1281
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,840
If you do that

1282
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Also for the shape

1283
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,840
There's something destined

1284
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
I am

1285
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Dario Pland

1286
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,840
I'm always sorry

1287
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Rio-san

1288
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,840
About giving medicine

1289
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
Speed

1290
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,840
thank you

1291
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
I

1292
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
I don't want to take a picture

1293
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
I am now

1294
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
Located in Yamai

1295
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
perhaps

1296
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
You will die

1297
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
My heart hurts

1298
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Hands waving

1299
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,840
The stone won't stop

1300
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,840
My voice

1301
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,840
A voice calling you

1302
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,840
My mother died.

1303
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Two of my fathers

1304
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
yes

1305
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Those shoes and

1306
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
What

1307
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
Pawn

1308
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,840
It has changed

1309
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
yes

1310
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
Until that day

1311
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,840
He died.

1312
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,840
Zexal

1313
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
I was separated from my wife by the moon.

1314
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,840
Yes.

1315
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
How to fight him

1316
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
Right now

1317
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,840
Lowering scum

1318
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,840
Battle and

1319
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Aha

1320
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Hardness

1321
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Threw it

1322
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,840
Assembled

1323
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Because I don't need it anymore

1324
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,840
The match is

1325
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Without love

1326
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,840
All those who were killed

1327
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Stolen

1328
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Shall I enter?

1329
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Name

1330
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
It's different

1331
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
On the body

1332
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
Flowing

1333
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
This hell

1334
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Zexal

1335
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
white

1336
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
This hunt

1337
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
All

1338
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,840
In these hands

1339
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
Win

1340
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,840
Human

1341
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,840
To the End

1342
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,840
Be prepared

1343
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Covering the wall

1344
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Enough

1345
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
brando

1346
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Father

1347
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,840
With the past

1348
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,840
Sleep

1349
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
all

1350
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
Perfect

1351
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
world

1352
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
Get in and out

1353
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,840
Come out

1354
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
Come out

1355
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,840
What happened to that medicine now?

1356
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
What's wrong?

1357
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
Are you okay

1358
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Name

1359
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
Your

1360
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
It's a letter from your father.

1361
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Death

1362
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
Magi

1363
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Your father's

1364
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
Symptoms

1365
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
It's written in detail

1366
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
Wow

1367
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Let me see it.

1368
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,840
My

1369
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
My father and symptoms

1370
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,840
Same

1371
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
You

1372
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
To Dad

1373
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
was carrying

1374
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
What

1375
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
Start talking

1376
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Answer me

1377
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
you

1378

I want to say

1381
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
This medicine

1382
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
Let me investigate

1383
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Excellent

1384
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
This medicine

1385
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
When I looked into it

1386
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
What to say

1387
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
Our

1397
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840

I

1399

Never again

1400
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
I won't talk about this

1401
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
To that guy

1431
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,840

yes

1436
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,940
I hated my father

1437
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,140
Above all, I was suspicious

1438
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,540
It got cut

01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,940

no

1444
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,840

I can't draw anymore

1449
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,340
A perfect world

1450
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,340
Get it

1451
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840

1452
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,840
How about it?

1453
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,340
What's going on? Yes, Master

1454
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,840
Speaking out loud like that

1455
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:31,520
Well, I'll be doing my second and third thesis. In the meantime, I've decided to give them a perfect tour. I will not be receiving any medicine or medical treatment except from them.

1456
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:45,440
But please let him do what he wants. I don't know why, but I believe in my son. Thank you.

1457
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:57,840
Seven years ago, this guy reacted to me, what happened?

1458
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,600
8 years

1459
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,300
Use this,

1460
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,300
It was disguised as a research accident.

1461
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,300
Gradually

1462
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:34,300
Your research will kill you

1463
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,580
field

1464
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:02,640
Rainy time, hide Libby and jump out

1465
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,440
Looking up at Koshio with the results already in mind

1466
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,300
Master is the coldness of the world today Listenomuuran Build

1467
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:14,600
I've arrived at this place in Soro

1468
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,100
May 2nd: Where the Plague Comes

1469
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:25,800
The country in front of me is on the other side of the world, there are reasons why I can't move forward

1470
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,600
Lose your right hand to the past and look at the stars

1471
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,800
It's finally here, Mr. Aird, Barabolet

1472
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,000
It will continue for a while, but who is running away?

1473
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,500
Who's coming? I'm the one who's good now.

1474
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:46,500
Hoga Street - I'll do everything

1475
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Hoga Street All the main undertakings

1476
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,500
I don't know if it arrived, but I'm sure there was a producer.

1477
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,500
Treplatzitzcuiscocoscue

1478
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,500
Hogar is the problem.

1479
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Just tell me the simple truth

1480
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,500
I'm going to rip this Kilean Ajibainar off the spot.

1481
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,500
If you resist, your life will be ruined.

1482
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,000
Hoga Street, now I know we're just a little old

1483
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Bowery, life is Ongar

1484
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,500
If you keep moving like this, you won't be able to escape to the cracks

1485
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:32,000
Hikatonare Tsukkoikasa Hoga Street

1486
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Let's lose it in the game too

1487
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Hoga Street Now I know our image chronology

1488
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
There is in the family

1489
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,000
You lose a finger, that's average.

1490
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Hoga Street Scatsl is in love

1491
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I came to look for Dr. Equol.

1492
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Don't miss out, ruin the rich boy

1493
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:32,000
But I'm an online nerd.

1494
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I made a mistake, but I'll put an end to it

1495
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Gantdown Slis Hwaga Street

1496
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Stop it

1497
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
If you lay a hand on that parent and child, you'll have to wait a little longer.

1498
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Why didn't you kick it as you pleased?

1499
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I came here for the land

1500
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That's why Kelsim thought you must have a father or siblings.

1501
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I don't want to do anything that would make your father sad.

1502
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Bring your name closer

1503
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Jora-san, Joestar-san, in the case of Dokkuek, the name is Wanchi

1504
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
If you're not careful, you'll get caught out. Be careful.

1505
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'll guide you through the process of speeding you down

1506
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Why did I like you?

1507

Gantdown Slis Hwaga Street

1508
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000

This courage is what I'm talking about

1513
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:06,000
With my pure heart, I will light up your darkness

1514
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
February is over and it's a complete disaster

1515
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
This plum blossom, this encounter,

1516
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000

1517
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000

Please get it today

1519
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
JoJo...

1520
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Huh...

1521
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,000
…

1522
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
…

1523
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000

1526
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
…

1527
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Jojo disappears into Rondo...

1528
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
…

1529
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
…Are you a passenger?

1530
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
…

1531
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Did you hear about the medicine?

1532
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Which one?

1533
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
…

1534
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Just now?

1535
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Can't resist a drink?

1536
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Is it because of the earthquake?

1537
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
My voice

1538
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
A voice calling you

1539
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It's being born

1540
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You're the only one I care about

1541
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Become the richest

1542
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
You and I are different

1543
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I didn't show it.

1544
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Oh no!

1545
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
This is what I'm hearing

1546
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Kitsutsu's face is blue

1547
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
When you first

1548
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I gave Bamma a good sleep.

1549
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I'm sure

1550
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
This face

1551
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
This face

1552
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
This face

1553
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Back of face

1554
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Wow

1555
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Wow

1556
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It's not even possible that it will be born

1557
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Inside

1558
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Earthquake Floyd

1559
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Delicious

1560
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's your fault

1561
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Wow

1562
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Make it plump

1563
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Pukula

1564
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,220
Should I do it or paint it?

1565
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,000
This white machine

1566
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Also, the company

1567
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Let me come over

1568
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's a journey of success

1569
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Hehehehe

1570
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Well then

1571
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Your research is dissolved

1572
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'll do it

1573
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Do it

1574
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,000
Ah

1575
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,100
, not easy

1576
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,200
What

1577
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,100
What

1578
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,600
What is this, what did you do?

1579
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,100
Benge Gong

1580
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,000
Dead

1581
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,800
If this much koshin is stabbed in the head, it's only natural that he'll be punished.

1582
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,000
It's an ancient Guomon tool.

1583
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Not dead

1584
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,500
Mamachi

1585
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
15

1586
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
What is this guy?

1587
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,700
Sue

1588
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,300
m

1589
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,400
Change

1590
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,240
Undevide apply

1591
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:29,760
Dragon

1592
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,600
then

1593
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:30,760
in

1594
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,560
in

1595
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,700
in

1596
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,840
in

1597
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,560
in

1598
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,640
Also

1599
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,000
already

1600
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,360
ambitions

1601
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm excited about you

1602
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,480
graders

1603
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:44,580
Are you flying?

1604
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:45,300
andin Glish

1605
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,220
ootlands

1606
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,220
stay

1607
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,700
maybe add orca Bureau

1608
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,380
If there was nothing like that

1609
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,660
me

1610
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,360
I was saved

1611
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
In sunlight

1612
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,360
Did it turn to ashes?

1613
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,360
This is

1614
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,360
The Power of Isukamen

1615
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
So, Deo

1616
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,360
Apparently he hasn't returned yet

1617
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
Support us right away!

1618
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Use your hair

1619
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
thank you

1620
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Hey

1621
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,360
That way of asking

1622
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,360
Bring Wyche.

1623
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Chocho

1624
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,360
It's great

1625
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,360
This is my responsibility

1626
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
picture?

1627
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,360
I

1628
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,360
If we put that guy in the Lutow family,

1629
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Deo's father

1630
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,360
Dario Pland

1631
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,360
That is to say

1632
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,360
For you

1633
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
I'll tell you

1634
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,360
You

1635
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,360
This is from my time as an Akanbo.

1636
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,360
surely

1637
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,360
This is my finger talk

1638
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
But

1639
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
No notification was submitted.

1640
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Finger speech

1641
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,360
A man who fell in and out

1642
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Corresponding

1643
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,360
The sign language is

1644
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Jostar Kyoga

1645
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
With my wife

1646
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,360
Now when I was given medicine

1647
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Something special made in pairs

1648
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:57,360
Akira was the one who was the Eastern Conflict

1649
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
picture?

1650
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
This is yours.

1651
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,360
This is a finger spelling I made with my wife.

1652
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Today is

1653
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,360
My wife

1654
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,360
Did you find it?

1655
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
He had tears in his eyes.

1656
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,360
I

1657
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,360
If only I had caught Hajiri

1658
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,360
Would you like to wish me a happy birthday?

1659
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,360
Recorded items

1660
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,360
What came off

1661
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,360
The lineage of 10-year-old Rutou

1662
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,360
It's a cultural fact

1663
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,360
Understood

1664
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,360
curler

1665
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,360
Hey

1666
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
Woody

1667
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,360
Planned

1668
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,360
Planned

1669
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,360
Stop

1670
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,360
Well then

1671
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,360
Dario Pland is

1672
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,360
Even with life and onjin

1673
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Nothing

1674
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,360
Just

1675
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,360
It's Nust

1676
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,360
Just a lie

1677
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
That

1678
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,360
I know

1679
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,360
Dio

1680
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,360
I was being careful.

1681
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,360
Why

1682
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,360
I

1683
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,360
Today's

1684
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,360
At that time

1685
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
On the current road

1686
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
Tears

1687
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,360
you

1688
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
he

1689
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360
Didn't I say this?

1690
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,360
This sign language is

1691
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,360
He gave it to me.

1692
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,360
There was a picture

1693
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
Ugh

1694
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,360
Yes.

1695
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,360
this is

1696
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,360
What I gave him

1697
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,360
He is innocent

1698
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,360
Yao's wife

1699
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
It's hard

1700
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
Mr. Pland

1701
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
yes

1702
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,360
This is yours

1703
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
This sign language

1704
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
hand

1705
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
To my family

1706
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
Please buy me something

1707
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
Just a lie

1708
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Why that?

1709
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,360
Deserveo

1710
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,360
If I

1711
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,360
In a strange way

1712
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,360
suffering

1713
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,360
If we had met

1714
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,360
The same thing

1715
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:48,360
Did you?

1716
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
picture

1717
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:55,360
For the ones I love

1718
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,360
The stars in the sky

1719
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,360
Light Yes

1720
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,360
Eventually

1721
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:07,360
The core speaks

1722
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
This friend

1723
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,360
Shibi

1724
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Darkness

1725
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,360
I'll clear it up

1726
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,360
Prayer place

1727
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,360
thank you

1728
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,360
you

1729
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,360
You're too kind

1730
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,360
This evil and

1731
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,360
It's warming in my heart

1732
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Maybe so

1733
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
But

1734
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,360
Think the opposite.

1735
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,360
Something called destiny

1736
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,360
from

1737
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,360
People

1738
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:46,360
Tell me

1739
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Forget

1740
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,360
That courage

1741
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,360
That loneliness

1742
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,360
Let's hug

1743
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,360
Orimo

1744
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:09,360
It's all connected

1745
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,360
To everything

1746
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,360
Garu

1747
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,360
I

1748
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:21,360
Believe in people

1749
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,360
With a secret

1750
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,360
For your viewing pleasure

1751
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Good

1752
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,360
it is

1753
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,360
someday

1754
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,360
Kakaya

1755
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,360
Gudarou

1756
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,360
There is another

1757
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,360
On the tray

1758
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,360
I

1759
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,360
Shichizuki

1760
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,360
Aki's Ambulance

1761
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:55,360
a

1762
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:01,360
bothersome

1763
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Noroi

1764
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,360
nine

1765
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,360
I

1766
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,360
Waiting for Dio

1767
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:21,360
still

1768
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,360
Can be stopped

1769
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,360
You

1770
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,360
I heard Nauwa-san

1771
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,360
Frosia's man

1772
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
Already the wall

1773
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
He said he beat it up and destroyed it.

1774
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,360
And the man

1775
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,360
When exposed to the morning sun

1776
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,360
Can't enter

1777
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
I heard

1778
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,360
It's the same as 30 years ago

1779
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Just like back then

1780
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,360
Park of Memories

1781
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,360
nailed down

1782
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
Kusabi

1783
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
Systemic training

1784
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
That morning sun

1785
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,360
Like this

1786
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,360
It was red

1787
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,360
Full of passion

1788
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:35,360
Longing for the road world

1789
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,360
My respected father

1790
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,360
Hit the rolling sea

1791
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,360
My beloved father

1792
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,360
Voice of Things

1793
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:53,360
At my exact moment

1794
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,360
Day 1

1795
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,360
From this hand

1796
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,360
Take it all away

1797
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,360
Including force

1798
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,360
To get it back

1799
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,360
Tomorrow for sure

1800
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:16,360
Tomorrow for sure

1801
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,360
Even if you open it, I'm thinking

1802
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,360
There's a saying that this is who he is.

1803
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,360
One day

1804
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,360
If you find it

1805
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,360
It will become irreversible

1806
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,360
This hand...

1807
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,360
Therefore

1808
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:04,360
I was back from London, and I got the materials.

1809
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,360
It's a shame, really.

1810
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,360
You may not understand, but this is the truth

1811
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,360
I understand, girl

1812
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,360
You are that kind of guy.

1813
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,360
I have a selfish request

1814
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,360
It's the last one

1815
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,360
Can you give me some time?

1816
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,360
Time to train with the police

1817
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,360
I

1818
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,360
I'm eating my life

1819
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,360
Born into a poor family

1820
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,360
I got a palm.

1821
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,360
I wore stupid color contact lenses

1822
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,360
When words

1823
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,360
Everyone is asking what they want to hear

1824
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,360
I was allowed to introduce myself

1825
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,360
I am

1826
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,360
JoJo, I understand!

1827
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,360
Anyone

1828
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,360
I'm pretending to want to hear it

1829
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,360
I was allowed to introduce myself

1830
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,360
I am

1831
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,360
I was allowed to introduce myself

1832
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,360
I'm Speedwagon of Osekkaiyaki

1833
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,360
I've been driving since it got stuck.

1834
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,360
I've seen a lot of different people

1835
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,360
So you can tell by the smell

1836
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:15,360
This guy is Bakise

1837
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,360
Really! The boy is already gone.

1838
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,360
Dad! I heard the whole story!

1839
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,360
I'll rest in my new room

1840
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,360
or

1841
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,360
I don't want to see you get caught

1842
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,360
That man won't give up

1843
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,360
I was born with that fate

1844
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,360
Sores!

1845
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,360
Girl, girl, I got it!

1846
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,360
You'll be released, but at least

1847
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,360
I want you to take over

1848
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
We've been together for seven years.

1849
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,360
Be careful!

1850
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,360
Understood

1851
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,360
I'll take the lead

1852
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,360
For humans

1853
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:24,360
There are limits

1854
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,360
I am

1855
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:30,360
I understand now

1856
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:35,360
The more you recreate it,

1857
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,360
The limits of life

1858
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,360
What are you talking about?

1859
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,360
I'm so frustrated

1860
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,360
In this hand

1861
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,360
There is nothing

1862
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,360
The empty logo

1863
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,360
With a glance next to me

1864
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,360
I can't see beyond

1865
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,360
No matter how much I write

1866
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,360
Follow these eyes

1867
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,360
Do you understand?

1868
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,360
That smiling sky

1869
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,360
I want you to know me

1870
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,360
This hand is out of reach

1871
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,360
I wrote that

1872
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:30,360
On that beautiful day

1873
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,360
This dumping ground will never disappear

1874
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,360
So now is the time

1875
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,360
Break this cage

1876
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,360
The stars

1877
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,360
Light

1878
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:47,360
One

1879
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,360
I am

1880
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,360
Mom

1881
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,360
Life

1882
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,360
It opens

1883
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,360
Right

1884
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,360
Yes

1885
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,360
Yes

1886
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,360
Yes

1887
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,360
please

1888
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,360
Yes

1889
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,360
Hahahaha

1890
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,360
Hahahaha

1891
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,360
Yes

1892
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,360
Yes

1893
01:28:35,360 --> 01:29:01,140
Initial battle plan

1894
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,140
I'll take your mother's finger

1895
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,140
Firmly

1896
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,140
I will do it without betraying the user.

1897
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:23,140
I've been hard on you

1898
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:29,140
Maybe when I got home I felt it was fair.

1899
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,140
Shoot

1900
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,140
It doesn't seem bad

1901
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,140
Gradually

1902
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:52,140
The last one

1903
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:57,140
In my son's arms

1904
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,140
father

1905
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:15,140
Do it.

1906
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,140
After all, at that time

1907
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:20,140
It was a mistake

1908
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:23,140
I did everything when I died

1909
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,140
Survey

1910
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,140
Whether it's a hearing or not

1911
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:32,140
I was always told

1912
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:36,140
Proudly

1913
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,140
everytime

1914
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:47,140
I said I'd save you

1915
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:51,140
I believe

1916
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,140
Even though I was told

1917
01:30:56,140 --> 01:31:01,140
I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you

1918
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:06,140
What do you believe?

1919
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:10,140
Open the door

1920
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:13,140
What is pride?

1921
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:17,140
What's the purpose

1922
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:21,140
Flowing through this body

1923
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:25,140
Survey results

1924
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:28,140
Always in judgement

1925
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:32,140
continued to exist

1926
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:35,140
Proudly

1927
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,140
Yourself

1928
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,140
Rishiki

1929
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:43,140
The voice of darkness

1930
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Open and secure

1931
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,140
Look up at the stars

1932
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:55,140
Put everything into it

1933
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:02,140
This engraved stone

1934
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:05,140
Dance your heart out

1935
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Dance and shine

1936
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:16,140
Send it to the stars that will become the future

1937
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:20,140
Flowing through this body

1938
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:24,140
Survey results

1939
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,140
Everything is connected

1940
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:31,140
It all makes sense

1941
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:37,140
I'm sad about this fate

1942
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:43,140
A single drop of courage

1943
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,140
It's Keiban and Daiyan.

1944
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,140
what up?

1945
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:58,140
That's the corpse

1946
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:01,140
Dion's body is missing.

1947
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,140
It became

1948
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,140
Satsuma

1949
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:06,140
Get away from the window

1950
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:07,140
Massage

1951
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,140
Keiban

1952
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:20,140
What is this guy, he's come back to life

1953
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,140
Even though I was interrupted by forgetting

1954
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,140
Be careful

1955
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,140
I have some bookies.

1956
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:29,140
Tomare

1957
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:32,140
Utero

1958
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:33,140
Don't be silly

1959
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,140
It's early

1960
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
I don't know above

1961
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,140
It was what was happening now

1962
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Haa ...

1963
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:56,140
Are you waking up?

1964
01:33:56,140 --> 01:34:00,140
Suddenly puffed up...

1965
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:07,140
Hiriamado is hard to laugh at

1966
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:15,140
You're J…

1967
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:25,140
I've got such amazing power

1968
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,140
From someday

1969
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:36,140
Your father's power

1970
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,140
A quick fix to the running.

1971
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,140
He escaped, so that's why he got killed.

1972
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:43,140
That running thing appears.

1973
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:50,140
What do you think?

1974
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:54,140
I can only get a bad taste from Misonoru

1975
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,140
If it stops

1976
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,140
If you peel off the head completely

1977
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,140
Stop it!

1978
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,140
Menoeka!

1979
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,380
Already

1980
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:20,400
It's stronger

1981
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,740
Crab Cui Crab Cui

1982
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:48,040
a!

1983
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:51,960
Wow, that's fun

1984
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:58,780
I'll enjoy this wonderful power for a little while longer.

1985
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:05,280
I don't know how far I can go yet

1986
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,100
Both specialists

1987
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,140
Don't give in to useless longings

1988
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:23,140
Did you say that?

1989
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:27,140
If you let it bloom,

1990
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,140
Humans have their limits

1991
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:39,140
Well, don't hide in the shadows, come out

1992
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:42,140
Kisamalabop

1993
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,140
Let it be my life

1994
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:53,140
I'm not even screaming that I can fly you

1995
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,140
It's organic

1996
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,140
I can't beat this day

1997
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,140
Speed ​​Low

1998
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:01,140
Run away from Toni Yasuki

1999
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,140
Confusing

2000
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,140
Don't run upstairs

2001
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,140
ah

2002
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:22,140
Run in the dark

2003
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:25,140
It's going up

2004
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,140
Well then

2005
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,140
I'm here

2006
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,140
Do you understand?

2007
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:36,140
Ladies, ladies, you first

2008
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:41,140
The more you run, the more light you scatter

2009
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:44,140
Today is your strength

2010
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,140
Finish eating

2011
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:49,140
It's useless, it's useless

2012
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:54,140
If you suck that life out

2013
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,140
This flickering

2014
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,140
Not from afar

2015
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:03,140
Let's give one

2016
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:08,140
Give me your strength

2017
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,140
From now on, always

2018
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,140
From your back

2019
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,140
On my back,

2020
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
There was someone in front

2021
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,140
My player is Kimetomo

2022
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:21,140
Final exam

2023
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:24,140
He also decided on his own

2024
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,140
Women

2025
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:28,140
Women's Palm

2026
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,140
You are burning

2027
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:32,140
I'm dead

2028
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,140
I lost it immediately

2029
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:38,140
Other than this color

2030
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:40,140
That too

2031
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:41,140
Burning

2032
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,140
Heat it up

2033
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:43,140
That is

2034
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,140
I'll close you

2035
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:58,140
I'm sure Uehara-san is thinking about this.

2036
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
More firepower

2037
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
That Mamoru's recovery power

2038
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,140
After placing it

2039
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:04,140
more

2040
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
More firepower

2041
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,140
Throw away

2042
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:09,140
The force of instinct

2043
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:10,140
If you do

2044
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,140
I will definitely lose it

2045
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Shit

2046
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:15,140
Jasasasa

2047
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,140

2048
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,140

2049
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,140

2050
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:35,140

2051

2052

2053

2054

2057

2058

2059

2060

2061
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:47,140

2062
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:50,140

2063
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:52,140

2064
01:39:53,140 --> 01:39:54,140

2065
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,140

2066
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,140

2067
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,140

2068
01:39:58,140 --> 01:39:59,140
6

2069
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:06,020
It's your fault, I almost fell into the basement

2070
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:10,140
Where do you approach? I've grown fond of you

2071
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:16,140
As I thought, this crying that won't let go was there

2072
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:18,640
You're the type who stands up for yourself

2073
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:20,640
My chest is insecure

2074
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:28,140
I'll do things I hate

2075
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,140
The one I saw was one I hated

2076
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:35,140
Let's go live a life that will make you feel like a child

2077
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:38,140
There was a lot of excitement.

2078
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:43,140
If you do it again, you'll die

2079
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:47,140

Can you hear me?

2087
01:41:57,140 --> 01:42:02,140
I can hear you

2088
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:08,140
I mentioned the Astika people before.

2089
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:16,140
That was a 13th century mistake, not a 16th century one.

2090
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:20,140
We must tell the story accurately

2091
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:31,140
It was a great loss for someone in that position.

2092
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:37,140
As someone said, I don't want to get old.

2093
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:46,140
By the way, did you have a proper break?

2094
01:42:46,140 --> 01:42:48,140
it was good

2095
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:53,140
I am the storyteller

2096
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:59,140
Many different people have become drinkers.

2097
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:03,140
And I continued to do

2098
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:07,140
I want all the acrylic stunts

2099

I did a complica

The story so far seems like a fairy tale

2107
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,140
is definitely a reality

2108
01:43:42,140 --> 01:43:47,140
And it gets weirder from here

2109
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:50,140
Yeah, strangely.

2110
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:55,140
At that time, the mansion was almost completely engulfed and collapsed.

2111
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:59,140
But Chosa was still there

2112
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:01,140
I was attacked by Dio

2113
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:04,140
But I lost everything

2114
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:08,140
Then see

2115
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,140
there were

2116
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:39,140
Did you see it over there? If you have this screen

2117
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:43,140
there were

2118
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:47,140
there were

2119
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:51,140
there were

2120
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:55,140
there were

2121
01:44:55,140 --> 01:45:05,140
I can hear the voice of your face, the voice that reads you

2122
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:10,140
I was rushed to the hospital and came to see Chosa, who was unconscious.

2123
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:13,140
This is me, but...

2124
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:19,140
Give me the hope to live

2125
01:45:19,140 --> 01:45:23,140
Something, this room is for visitors.

2126
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:25,140
That's why I came

2127
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,140
I have enough vocabulary

2128
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:29,140
Please come on the 5th.

2129
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,140
Are you okay?

2130
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:56,140
Can you hear me?

2131
01:45:56,140 --> 01:46:05,140
Can you hear my voice?

2132
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:09,140
listened to each other

2133
01:46:09,140 --> 01:46:15,140
Once again, when I see a vivid person

2134
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:19,140
Your voice

2135
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:30,140
I

2136
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:35,140
Unfortunately, I continued to sleep.

2137
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:37,140
All the mansions

2138
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,140
Please stay calm now

2139
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,140
We've passed the statistics, but times are still tough.

2140
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:45,140
I'm glad you're alive

2141
01:46:45,140 --> 01:46:49,140
You've been nursing me

2142
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:54,140
You are Yamasaka

2143
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:56,140
But they look similar

2144
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:59,140
Who do you think looks like me? Erina Pendleton

2145
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,140
It's been a while

2146
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,140
Female Joestar

2147
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,140
Why

01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,140
This is my father's hospital

2149
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:10,140
India moved too far seven years ago.

2150
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:13,140
I recently planned

2151
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:16,140
It's really been a while

2152
01:47:16,140 --> 01:47:19,140
I was weak

2153
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:24,140
It wasn't my first time with you

2154
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:27,140
It was me who was young

2155
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:32,140
I couldn't face you

2156
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:36,140
That voice remains unchanged

2157
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:40,140
This voice remains unchanged

2158
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:44,140
Vivid reverb

2159
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:48,140
The sky gets higher

2160
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:52,140
Erina JoJo

2161
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:56,140
The joy of being there

2162
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:04,140
The wind left behind by the clouds rises a little

2163
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:11,140
Elina

2164
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,140
sorry

2165
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:15,140
My mind is shaking and I lose consciousness

2166
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:18,140
With me and my arms

2167
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:21,140
I'll always support you

2168
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:25,140
Eye to eye

2169
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:29,140
If you touch it, it's there

2170
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,140
Plainness is courage

2171
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,140
Moving on to tomorrow

2172
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:41,140
Hand in hand

2173
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:45,140
Touch and there

2174
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:49,140
When our eyes meet

2175
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:53,140
Always Now

2176
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,140
Touching Hearts

2177
01:48:58,140 --> 01:49:01,140
overlap

2178
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:04,140
attract

2179
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,140
fit

2180
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,140
That day

2181
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:15,140
Continue with the two of us

2182
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,140
destiny

2183
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,140
yes

2184
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:23,140
The encounter of people

2185
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:27,140
Maybe it's decided by fate

2186
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,140
Kitty Dwagon

2187
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:31,140
Cool!

2188
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:43,140
lover

2189
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:46,140
lover

2190
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:49,140
lover

2191
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:51,140
See you again soon

2192
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,140
It's a camera

2193
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,140
Heaven and earth are the same woman

2194
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:57,140
A girl

2195
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,140
Early afternoon

2196
01:49:59,140 --> 01:50:03,140
Its Appearance

2197
01:50:03,140 --> 01:50:07,140
The agreement is mutual

2198
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:13,740
No movement or state of affairs, the truth cannot be grasped

2199
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:21,340
Don't walk there at night like you do.

2200
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:24,840
It's going to happen. He's going to appear.

2201
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:31,840
London is also popular

2202
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:35,200
It's getting chaotic, I don't know anything about it

2203
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:37,480
Black people don't eat

2204
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,740
If I could have it, I would have the darkness of the present.

2205
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,440
Yes, but leave!

2206
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,520
Chasing the ripples

2207
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:52,300
I wanted to convey

2208
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:54,600
This mod official

2209
01:50:54,600 --> 01:50:56,800
I won't go home early

2210
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,300
I can see the celebration star

2211
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,300
But there might be a Jap who will be the first to appear.

2212
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:07,300
Is that a lie?

2213
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:10,300
It's scary

2214
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:17,300
Now you are like that

2215
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:21,300
Even though we're talking

2216
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:34,300
Play until the end of the night

2217
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:39,300
Relax

2218
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,300
Who is it?

2219
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,300
you

2220
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:52,300
I liked it

2221
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:56,300
Because I was seen

2222
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,300
I don't feel any pain

2223
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:06,300
There's no more of that

2224
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:09,300
Reborn now

2225
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,300
Let's start my life

2226
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:14,300
I have to heal my ache

2227
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,300
I need life

2228
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:19,300
So I feel less fulfilled

2229
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,300
Don't you want power?

2230
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:25,300
The Stone Mask...

2231
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:29,300
I'll give it to you

2232
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,300
Man is bound by all treasures

2233
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,300
I fear great evil

2234
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,300
But very rarely

2235
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,300
Without all treasure

2236
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,300
There is an evil elite

2237
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,300
Me

2238
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:45,300
You are

2239
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,300
How about it?

2240
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,300
Will this Diot come with me?

2241
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,300
To you

2242
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,300
What are you trying to say about me?

2243
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,300
I understand.

2244
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,300
So you

2245
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,300
What's happening?

2246
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,300
I can dance to your heart's content

2247
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:01,300
Such

2248
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:03,300
Covered in the distance

2249
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,300
Such

2250
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,300
Lose too much

2251
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:09,300
That's good enough now.

2252
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,300
Who is it?

2253
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,300
It seems like it will change

2254
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,300
There's already one

2255
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,300
Yes.

2256
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,300
Well then

2257
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,300
You don't have to worry anymore

2258
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,300
More spinning than ever before in my hands

2259
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,300
This is

2260
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,300
Such as

2261
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:24,300
do not have

2262
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:27,300
It's crowded

2263
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,300
Because of this

2264
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,300
You

2265
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,300
Come stretch

2266
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,300
Jack

2267
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:34,300
Zalipa

2268
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,300
This hand

2269
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:39,300
Anyway

2270
01:53:39,300 --> 01:53:41,300
Atanosa

2271
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:43,300
Do you see the time?

2272
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,300
Together

2273
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,300
That's not right

2274
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,300
There

2275
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:51,300
To this time

2276
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:54,300
This is a bit disappointing

2277
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:55,300
nine

2278
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:56,300
My

2279
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,300
Restoration

2280
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:00,300
That's it

2281
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,300
Your

2282
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,300
It's a hobby

2283
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,300
It's a hobby

2284
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,300
It's a hobby

2285
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
It's a hobby

2286
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,300
It's a hobby

2287
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:18,300
Kekari

2288
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:23,300
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

2289
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:34,300
Messy tears

2290
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:35,300
became

2291
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,300
Like this

2292
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:41,460
Ban Duan

2293
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:47,000
That Ishika Village

2294
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:51,880
他の棚同城細相信台

2295
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:54,960
yes

2296
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,280
It's okay

2297
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:02,680
Are you okay

2298
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,840
let's go

2299
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:09,300
Huh?

2300
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,300
what happened?

2301
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,300
Who is it?

2302
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:15,300
I've been here for a while now

2303
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,300
Jora-san Choustar-kun

2304
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,300
Huh? And

2305
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:21,300
Miss Elida Pendleton

2306
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:27,300
I'm surprised I survived

2307
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:29,300
That Iskamen's power

2308
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:31,300
Isukamen!

2309
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,300
Wait!

2310
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Jola-san

2311
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,300
Oshipa

2312
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:39,300
Keep it open

2313
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,300
By air

2314
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,300
Wherever you go, you'll be disappointed.

2315
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:45,300
Becoming a mites

2316
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,300
That's lame!

2317
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:49,300
The air seems to be tight

2318
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,300
No appearance

2319
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,300
I am Separi Danshak

2320
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:55,300
All I have is courage

2321
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:57,300
The Power of Isukamen

2322
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:59,300
I'm your friend

2323
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:01,300
Your breathing

2324
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:03,300
To him

2325
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:05,300
Your breathing

2326
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:07,300
I suffered pain

2327
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,300
I'm your perspective

2328
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,300
Jora-san Jowstar

2329
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:13,300
What is it?

2330
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:15,300
What's that pain?

2331
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:17,300
Why is my name

2332
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:19,300
Appearance

2333
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:21,300
Give me one

2334
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,300
I'll show you the answer

2335
01:56:23,300 --> 01:56:25,300
Follow me

2336
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,300
Just now I

2337
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,300
Eyes change

2338
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:31,300
Whether it shakes or not

2339
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,300
I love you

2340
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,300
What will happen next?

2341
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,300
This breathing

2342
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,300
The place to wake up

2343
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:51,300
Now is the time to show it and run

2344
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:53,300
Smart

2345
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,300
Smart

2346
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:57,300
Smart

2347
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,300
Smart

2348
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:01,300
Smart

2349
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:03,300
Petuna Cokyurei

2350
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,300
Country Petunassau

2351
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:07,300
The concussion

2352
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:09,300
Hackopping

2353
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,300
Tyaeaars

2354
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:13,300
Energy is generated

2355
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,300
The name is

2356
01:57:15,300 --> 01:57:17,300
Hamon Energy

2357
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:21,300
Horororororororororororororororororororororororororororo

2358
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:29,300
Hamon's attack

2359
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,300
Thank you

2360
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,300
This miracle

2361
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,300
Dropped

2362
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,300
This is

2363
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,300
The Power of Hamon

2364
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,300
Kokum brings

2365
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,300
The power of liquid

2366
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,300
Smart

2367
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:51,300
Smart

2368
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,300
Cocuille

2369
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,660
Everyone can create a little bit of energy in the flow of life.

2370
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:59,460
Carrying heroes and adjusting responses

2371
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,660
The bond force converts that small amount of energy into

2372
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,780
Collected from the whole body

2373
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:07,700
This is made possible by a certain breathing routine.

2374
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:08,980
Breathing is the power of now

2375
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:10,740
Yes, the power of breathing

2376
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,220
Yes, I know

2377
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,180
Thinking about it

2378
01:58:19,180 --> 01:58:21,860
I frown at this breathing technique

2379
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:24,060
So I'm going to say it to you

2380
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:25,220
Dios

2381
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:29,180
Kamen is owned by someone who hasn't changed.

2382
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:33,300
The amount of treasure we have now is

2383
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,660
I now have enough of the world

2384
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:39,980
I followed Kamen

2385
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,860
Destroying and eating

2386
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:43,860
Dio is alive

2387
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:46,220
Just catch cute

2388
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:48,540
If you don't destroy it

2389
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:50,540
In the hands of destruction

2390
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,340
Well, is there any more?

2391
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,340
Yours

2392
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,660
Your world

2393
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,900
Fate is weak and sluggish

2394
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:59,900
I finally found it

2395
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:02,300
Tattered and worn

2396
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:03,980
Do you accept it?

2397
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:06,780
Eyes working hard

2398
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:10,740
Everything was discussed

2399
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,740
Sma

2400
01:59:14,740 --> 01:59:15,740
Sma

2401
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,020
Sma

2402
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,660
Sma

2403
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:27,900
destiny

2404
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,380
fight

2405
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:38,900
That's my destiny

2406
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:41,380
You mean me?

2407
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,260
The will of the person

2408
01:59:43,260 --> 01:59:45,500
Extracting the power of the path from "no"

2409
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:48,100
Leave the humans to rest

2410
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,100
it is

2411
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,620
You must take blood energy from others.

2412
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:53,940
On the other hand, Hamon's power

2413
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:55,780
Mizukaru's blood flows

2414
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:58,340
Extracting energy

2415
01:59:58,340 --> 02:00:00,820
I was thinking

2416
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,060
Same energy

2417
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,300
Yeah

2418
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,300
It's Smari

2419
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:14,340
To remove this jamon

2420
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:17,740
What do you think I should do?

2421
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:19,740
I'm starting to understand

2422
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,140
Jamon

2423
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:27,820
If you hit another Hamon

2424
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,820
They'll explode

2425
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:31,900
And the tears of energy

2426
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:35,420
It has the same shape as the sunlight

2427
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:37,300
The power to defeat Dio

2428
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,700
yes

2429
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:40,540
There's no time

2430
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:44,940
Develop an attitude that turns courage into strength

2431
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:46,660
woman

2432
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:48,460
Dio

2433
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:50,740
Energy

2434
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,900
I won't get involved in anything that gets you involved

2435
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:57,100
Right now I just want you to stay

2436
02:00:59,420 --> 02:01:03,180
I'll definitely come back to this place

2437
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,540
This is

2438
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:10,780
Is it a female jamon?

2439
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:12,780
Yeah

2440
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:16,940
Haa

2441
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:41,180
Clouds flow

2442
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:44,060
The wind carries my thoughts

2443
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:46,060
Measurement

2444
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:49,100
go around

2445
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:53,580
I nodded.

2446
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:59,020
To your resolve

2447
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:02,860
In sadness

2448
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:09,820
Shining stars

2449
02:02:10,060 --> 02:02:16,780
I won't lead you to the fate you desire

2450
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:23,100
I got stuck in the mud

2451
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:29,740
I was here

2452
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:33,580
Left behind

2453
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:36,620
Living the dream

2454
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,660
Wait by the window

2455
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:41,660
Loneliness is

2456
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,660
For whom?

2457
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,660
Even if it doesn't reach

2458
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:51,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2459
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:53,660
I want to scream

2460
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,660
I

2461
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:59,660
Even if it doesn't shine now

2462
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,660
I want to scream

2463
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:03,660
I

2464
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:05,660
Because

2465
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:09,660
you

2466
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:11,660
There is light

2467
02:03:11,660 --> 02:03:13,660
anytime

2468
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:17,660
Don't let your destiny lead you

2469
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,660
I

2470
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,660
Spending my days

2471
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,660
Let's live

2472
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:27,660
Looking up at the stars

2473
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,660
While

2474
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:33,660
This place

2475
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,660
Someday you

2476
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,660
He'll tell you

2477
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:47,660
Proudly

2478
02:03:49,660 --> 02:03:51,660
Let's continue to exist

2479
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:55,660
Your everything

2480
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:57,660
Acceptance

2481
02:03:57,660 --> 02:04:01,660
Destiny and Love

2482
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:03,660
yes

2483
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:07,660
So that you can call

2484
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:11,660
The stars

2485
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:13,660
Daylight

2486
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:15,660
Your

2487
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:19,660
Don't let your destiny lead you

2488
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:23,660
The stars

2489
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:25,660
Daylight

2490
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:27,660
Where

2491
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,660
Even if

2492
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,660
I

2493
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:33,660
Me

02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:39,660

Live on

02:04:49,660 --> 02:04:51,660
Go

Sioster!

2523
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:56,600
Aa ...

02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:57,800
Oooooohhhh!

2525
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,720
I was looking for you too!

2526
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:00,920
Because! Because!

2527
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,360
Dio was there!

2528
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,200
I'm willing to rip off your value!

2529
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:06,420

Be careful of the skilled

2537
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:16,580
This guy has a lot of power

2538
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:18,600
What's with this weirdo Pojnock?

2539
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:19,100
I'll come when I get there!

2540

02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,400
Daizara doesn't have a phone

2545
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:15,400
Gon!

2546
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,400
My body...

2547
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,400
Why this?

2548
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:27,400
Ah! It's hot! Which one is it?

2549
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,400
Oh! Here we go again!

見事だ、少少

2551
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,400
I'm surprised I was able to see Hamogo on such a short trip.

2552
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:41,400
yeah…

2553
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,400

2554
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:45,400
JoJo...

2555
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,400
I've lost a lot

2556
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,400
So I wanted power

2557
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,400
But that's...

2558
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:57,400
Not the same as Dio

2559
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:58,400
To insult someone

2560
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,400
It's fundamentally different from the power he was stealing.

2561
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,400
Another is the same power

2562
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:08,400
Things like this will go down like a ride

2563
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:12,400
The one who came created the Vikings

2564
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,400
A harsh coming will wake you up

2565
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,400
Because I know the pain

2566
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,400
The Vikings who heard it

2567
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,400
Miyatsuka is different.

2568
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:23,400
You

2569
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,400

02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,400
pain

2571
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:29,400
The pain of dying

2572
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:33,400
The pain of absorbing the rest

2573
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:36,400
The sky of those I want to protect

2574
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,400

2576
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:45,400

Believe me

2578
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,400
I was always told

2579
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:58,400

2580
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,400

2581
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:09,400
I still don't know what to believe

2582
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,400

Holding this pain

2590
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,400
The screen is not a word

2591
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,400
I happened by chance

2592
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,400
Tonight in my memory

2593
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,400

2597
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,400
I handed it over

2599
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:06,400
That screen

2600
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,400

Love you

2607
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,400
At that time, the morning sun

2608
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,400
What illuminated

2609
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,400
It was my insect

2610
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:36,400

2613
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,400
At that moment it stopped

2614
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:52,400
Embracing the pain of love

2615
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:54,400

2621
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,400
The courage to own the pain

2622
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,400
and

2623
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,400
Back to school

2624
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,400
Right?

2625
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,400
The thought

2626
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,400
I haven't forgotten

2627
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,400

02:17:06,340 --> 02:17:09,100
Fuji Ha Well He vomiste

2728
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:15,100
That is the world, this unshakable world

2729
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:21,100
The world of the accompaniment The world of the accompaniment

2730
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:30,100
Long clouds hang over this country. Now is the time to speak up.

2731
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:35,100
A cry from the sky continues

2732
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:40,100
Those legs are going to end and shake

2733
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:43,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

2734
02:17:43,100 --> 02:17:47,100
Raise this voice

2735
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:51,100
Searching for

Match the search

2738
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:05,100
I remember shouting from the sky

2739
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:09,100
It's scary

2740
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:15,100
Shout from the sky, "Losing!"

2741
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:19,100
It's scary from the sky

2742
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:24,100
This has taken my world away

2743
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:27,100

Hair Child and Varialli

02:18:39,100 --> 02:18:43,100
Make history solid

2748
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:49,100
Everything will be solid and firm soon.

2749
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:52,100
I feel empty so I have to be strong

2750
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:56,100
Scream from the heart

2751
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:58,100
It's scary

2752
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:01,100

2753
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:06,100

2754
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:09,100
All seems solid

2755
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:11,100
Search

2756
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,100

Search

2758
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:16,100
Search

2759
02:19:16,100 --> 02:19:21,980
Two things that hold everything back

2760
02:19:21,980 --> 02:19:24,920
Now, with the current

2761
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:27,480
I can't get it even though it's obvious

2762
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:29,320
I can't get it even though it's obvious

2763
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:38,260
This world once again, the world of reason

2764
02:19:38,260 --> 02:19:47,500
It's shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking, shaking

2765
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:50,600
But it's amazing Didhy

Body de jai

2769
02:19:57,340 --> 02:19:58,340

2770
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:01,060
The water comes out here

2771
02:20:01,060 --> 02:20:03,060
Because, oh, it's true!

2772
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:04,060
Popping out

2773
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:09,060
The sun has set

2774
02:20:12,060 --> 02:20:14,060
Kisamara's life too

2775
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:16,060
When you're bossing

2776
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:20,060
I've been preparing for that moment

2777
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:22,060
So it's going to be a Dosukuro Eki

2778
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:24,060
You have to forgive me as a human being

2780
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:27,060
It's a fighting mindset

2781
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:33,060
I'm bored

2782
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:36,060
At first

2783
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:43,060

It's Lesland.

went

2790
02:20:58,560 --> 02:20:59,360
It's just a good thing

2791
02:20:59,360 --> 02:21:00,960
From the other day, there was no enemy

2792
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:02,960
Defeat that guy

2793
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,960
I didn't come back later,

2794
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:05,960
You are here

2795
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:07,960
Hitakaze is a Viking

2796
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:08,960
I'll book it and give it a go

2797
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:09,960
That's dangerous

Severe living activity is born

2801
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:24,960
I wonder if this bath will have a buffet.

2802
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:27,960
Where is my west today?

2803
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:29,960
Warm thoughts

2804
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:32,960
Have courage and breathe

2805
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,960
Won't open

2806
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:36,960
Human participation is

2807
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:38,960
Courageous Participation

2808
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,960
Humans are amazing too

2809
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,960
The awesomeness of courage

2810
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:44,960
All

2811
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,960
Connect

2812
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,960
resonate

2813
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,960
Disturbing your breathing

2814
02:21:51,960 --> 02:21:54,460
Hmm

2815
02:21:54,480 --> 02:21:57,760
There's no cold

2816
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:00,460
My Hallow

2817
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:01,200

2818
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,040
Vegetable warping

Tears

2823
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:09,840
It was a dream where I told my boss

2824
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,640
It's gone

2825
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:13,960
Cragbeshable

2826
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:15,960
Society too

2827
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:16,960

2828
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:18,960

2830
02:22:21,660 --> 02:22:24,160
Let's pull

2831
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:27,140
Wrapped in cherry blossoms Wrapped in cherry blossoms

2832
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:29,340
The color of the house

2833
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:33,520
Don't ask for more yet

2834
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:40,420
DRA I want to see

2835
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,660
Grz

2836
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:46,540
Gather at Gabo Japma Ra

2837
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:49,420
Sun Feather From yourstag

2838
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:52,420
This is the power that will defeat you!

2839
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:58,420
Dio Brando!

2840
02:22:58,420 --> 02:22:59,420
a?

2841
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:01,420
I don't know you personally

2842
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:02,420
But

2843
02:23:02,420 --> 02:23:04,420
I woke up your brain

2844
02:23:04,420 --> 02:23:06,420
Dare to face a stone wall

2845
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:09,420
It's so far away

2846
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:11,420
Don't ride it

2847
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,420
bard!

2848
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:23,420
- If I can heal this wound

2849
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:30,420
It was attached to you

2850
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:34,420
Umm... I feel the injustice at the beginning.

2851
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:41,420
At Kisamara's command, I will disinfect this wound in the air.

2852
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:46,420
How much life did you suck out of that wound?

2853
02:23:50,420 --> 02:23:59,420
Do you remember the bread you've ever eaten?

2854
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:08,420
I'll let you sleep.

2855
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,420
The width of the sun!

2856
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:14,420
bread!

2857
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:18,420
品積品積!

2858
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:25,420
This shows that the length of the arms and the energy of the arms are related to the product.

2859
02:24:25,420 --> 02:24:30,420
I can control my body freely.

2860
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:37,420
If you let the results live later, you won't convey that power!

2861
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:40,420
Breathe, breathe!

2862
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:42,420
Help!

2863
02:24:44,420 --> 02:24:48,420
Waste waste waste waste!

2864
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
breathe?

2865
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:52,420
Conger eel?

2866
02:24:52,420 --> 02:24:59,420
Hehe, if that's the case, it would be fitting for you to play a fanfare for me.

2867
02:25:01,420 --> 02:25:04,580
Hahaha

2868
02:25:07,620 --> 02:25:14,180
There's no stock strategy that suits you, friend.

2869
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:16,420
That's right.

2870
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:18,420
Do you remember?

2871
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:27,420
One day, Icha, your father told a desperate story, what, in the 16th century.

2872
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:31,020
Elizabeth's assassination attempt

2873
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:36,040
On the beard that was executed in the death knell

2874
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:40,180
Mary Stuart

2875
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:42,620
It was used there

2876
02:25:42,620 --> 02:25:44,500
Two people

2877
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,420
It's about an angry Kishi.

2878
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:48,620
Dad's

2879
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:50,220
Now

2880
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:55,020
We listened to it together

2881
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,620
Jojon, Dion

2882
02:25:57,620 --> 02:26:00,140
Today, this tradition is passed down in England.

2883
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:03,740
Let's talk about two Kishi

2884
02:26:03,740 --> 02:26:06,540
Living in the spirit of Shingeru

2885
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:07,500
Kishi's

2886
02:26:07,500 --> 02:26:11,940
The rest of the story

2887
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:16,420
Once upon a time, 300 years ago

2888
02:26:16,420 --> 02:26:20,900
Let's cheer on the two of us

2889
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:25,460
Jojohn, Elizabethan

2890
02:26:25,460 --> 02:26:29,940
Beautiful Mary Stuart

2891
02:26:29,940 --> 02:26:34,460
Mary gave me that turgid

2892
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:37,940
The elegance of two legends

2893
02:26:37,940 --> 02:26:41,140
Hahahahahaha

2894
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:43,060
From now on

2895
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:47,140
Ophiry like you

2896
02:26:47,140 --> 02:26:49,540
The sky

2897
02:26:49,540 --> 02:26:51,940
Deliberate Heart

2898
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:56,740
Hit the target

2899
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:59,140
Two without two

2900
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:01,340
I conveyed that power

2901
02:27:01,340 --> 02:27:05,740
I think about it

2902
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:08,020
The Dearie Situation

2903
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:10,340
Find peace

2904
02:27:10,340 --> 02:27:15,140
Use clothing

2905
02:27:15,140 --> 02:27:16,340
Flowing Time

2906
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:18,340
Their system and methods

2907
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:19,460
By Elizabeth

2908
02:27:19,460 --> 02:27:21,540
A friend's container is placed on it

2909
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,940
I'll be caught

2910
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:28,340
I don't like the elegance of the two of them.

2911
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:32,940
To save Mary

2912
02:27:32,940 --> 02:27:37,340
To stop the grace of the two

2913
02:27:37,340 --> 02:27:41,940
Elizabeth calls out

2914
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:46,340
You guys should mess with us

2915
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:53,140
Save Shugun's life.

2916
02:27:53,140 --> 02:27:55,440
To Elizabeth

2917
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:59,140
There is no denying it

2918
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:04,140
Our difficult story

2919
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:09,540
Because of this order

2920
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,540
It's so easy to get caught up in it

2921
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:13,940
I'll scoop up the maid

2922
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:16,540
This system is unacceptable

2923
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,940
I bowed my head

2924
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,340
It's possible that it's lying around here like trash.

2925
02:28:22,340 --> 02:28:23,740
I'll keep it cool

2926
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:26,740
Because there is a semi-translated version

2927
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:31,340
Wow

2928
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:35,040
To Elizabeth who went behind the scenes

2929
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:40,440
If I were to ride on the back of this

2930
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:45,040
To Elizabeth

2931
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,340
With anger erupting

2932
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,440
That's why it resonates

2933
02:28:49,440 --> 02:28:53,440
Melt this neck

2934
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:56,140
By Plaford's Hands

2935
02:28:56,140 --> 02:28:58,440
That hair gets tangled

2936
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:01,840
I'll wait

2937
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:12,840
This hair of my heart came alive

2938
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:20,840
There isn't enough kishiro

2939
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:22,840
A goosebump-inducing proposition

2940
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:24,540
What a heart of sentient beings!

2941
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:27,140
But they should have done better.

2942
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:29,840
I couldn't do anything in the first match.

2943
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,840
It can also be said that there is no waste.

2944
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:33,540
You may be right.

2945
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:35,740
But nothing is meaningless

2946
02:29:35,740 --> 02:29:38,440
The same goes for when you came to this house.

2947
02:29:38,440 --> 02:29:40,640
It's all connected

2948
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:43,140
I thought they kept looking at the stars

2949
02:29:43,140 --> 02:29:45,840
I want to believe

2950
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:48,240
People are like destiny

2951
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:54,840
Reach out your hand to me, where I live

2952
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:57,040
Are you seeing stars?

2953
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:06,640
Or either one

2954
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:10,040
Gradually

2955
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:16,040
Say it's your fault

2956
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:27,040
The two of them

2957
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:34,040
The devil also created Bedbukhushki

2958
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:40,040
I can fight history and die

2959
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:42,040
Got it?

2960
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:52,040
This is what you look like

2961
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:55,040
To clear one's name

2962
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:58,040
What an embarrassing sight

2963
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:01,040
Don't you think so?

2964
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,040
Everyone looks happy

2965
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
A continuation of that day

2966
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:10,040
Tarkus Bellaford

2967
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:12,040
The secret name Fansuar

2968
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:14,040
I'm tired

2969
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:17,040
It's strange but delicious

2970
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:18,040
That's it

2971
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:21,040
Slow Idiom Kiss Bellaford

2972
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:22,040
and Tarkus

2973
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:24,040
I think that's a bit

2974
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:27,040
It's too late, I can't imagine

2975
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:30,040
But I also have something to carry

2976
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:33,040
I'm the slowest person in the world

2977
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,040
How many were filled?

2978
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:41,040
The man's anger

2979
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,040
I kissed and received it

2980
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,040
My master

2981
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:46,040
In this Braford

2982
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:50,040
I would like to draw every day of this man's life.

2983
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:53,040
Okay, that's good.

2984
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,040
Make a good list and get it

2985
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:01,040
If it hurts, run away

2986
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:04,040
Survey

2987
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:08,040
I won't let you get away with it

2988
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,040
In the park of memories

2989
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,040
nailed down

2990
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,040
Wedge

2991
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,040
Anyway

2992
02:32:30,040 --> 02:32:33,040
That morning sun

2993
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:34,040
Like this

2994
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:36,040
It was red

2995
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:40,040
Osa

2996
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:42,040
You live

2997
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,040
Now

2998
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:55,040
I can't do anything

2999
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,040
I am, I am

3000
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Nothing to try

3001
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
I'm not good

3002
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,040
Wait a minute

3003
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,040
Don't mess with me

3004
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,040
Even at a time like this

3005
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,040
Even if you give up

3006
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,040
Come

3007
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,040
Carefully

3008
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:09,040
Continue

3009
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,040
Tomorrow for sure

3010
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,040
Tomorrow for sure

3011
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:14,040
Make Irumide

3012
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:17,040
I kept chasing

3013
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:18,040
Remember

3014
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
Is the gap your answer?

3015
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,040
Is that your anger?

3016
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,040
What will happen?

3017
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:27,040
Kisana

3018
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,040
I was just angry.

3019
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,040
and

3020
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:31,040
Once processed

3021
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,040
That's what happened

3022
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3023
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:36,040
Get on the Tokoro Bull Bus

3024
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,040
What's scary is

3025
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,040
It's not pain

3026
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:41,040
already

3027
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,040
What you should know

3028
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:44,040
regain

3029
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,040
Morning tomorrow

3030
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:47,040
Tomorrow

3031
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:48,040
Tomorrow

3032
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,040
Now

3033
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:53,040
There

3034
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:57,020
picture

3035
02:33:57,020 --> 02:33:59,040
Tokewa

3036
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,040
Even if I return

3037
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:01,040
When

3038
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:02,040
I guess he did it

3039
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:09,040
Kiki's

3040
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,040
Looking back at the station

3041
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:14,360
Is it urgent?

3042
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:16,360
Don't wait for tomorrow

3043
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:20,360
I start walking

3044
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:24,360
Should believe

3045
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:28,360
It should be said that

3046
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:34,360
Tomorrow Now

3047
02:34:34,360 --> 02:34:36,360
girl

3048
02:34:38,360 --> 02:34:42,360
The Beat of Decision with You

3049
02:34:44,360 --> 02:34:48,360
Why is it moving?

3050
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:51,360
When I looked into it

3051
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:53,360
That

3052
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:55,460
Hiding

3053
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:01,360
Pikima

3054
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:04,360
pain

3055
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:12,360
No or

3056
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,360
You just said it hurts

3057
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:18,360
You are feeling pain now

3058
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,360
pain

3059
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:27,360
That's why I stopped being that Sarakai

3060
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,360
So you stopped the prefecture

3061
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,360
You are a proud wrecker

3062
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:38,360
Human

3063
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:41,360
What I saw

3064
02:35:43,360 --> 02:35:45,360
Sennorakashi

3065
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:50,360
This is a human being

3066
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,360
Because there are similarities

3067
02:35:54,360 --> 02:35:57,360
I can feel the joy of being here now

3068
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:59,360
I can be here now

3069
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:09,360
I'll bother you

3070
02:36:10,360 --> 02:36:12,360
I feel now

3071
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,360
Bravo

3072
02:36:16,360 --> 02:36:19,360
I will dedicate to you the words engraved on my prefecture.

3073
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:25,360
Something like this

3074
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:28,360
and

3075
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:30,360
Let's go

3076
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:42,360
To save souls

3077
02:36:44,360 --> 02:36:46,360
That I have to kill

3078
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,360
Come

3079
02:36:50,360 --> 02:36:53,360
Affection

3080
02:36:56,360 --> 02:36:58,360
Affection

3081
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:03,360
No way

3082
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:07,360
To think he would defeat Kurokiko

3083
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:11,360
also

3084
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:14,360
You are this Dio

3085
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:21,360
Haybay Day

3086
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:24,360
The attack of the jamon that plant

3087
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:26,360
I tempted you

3088
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:34,360
What changes is not the outcome but the vile Hamon

3089
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,360
It's dangerous, Tama

3090
02:37:40,360 --> 02:37:43,360
At the beginning of the season

3091
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:55,360
Brami's brother

3092
02:37:57,360 --> 02:37:58,960
Loss of motivation and enthusiasm

3093
02:38:07,360 --> 02:38:08,380
驚

3094
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:14,360
Lots of Ou

3095
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:20,860
From now on

3096
02:38:22,860 --> 02:38:26,860
I tried my best.

3097
02:38:26,860 --> 02:38:30,860
I'll do it, I'll do it!

3098
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:38,860
JoJo

3099
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:48,360
Follow me for my last jamon

3100
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:50,360
My companion

3101
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:53,360
JoJo!

3102
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:14,360
Wow

3103
02:39:14,360 --> 02:39:18,060
always

3104
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:20,360
Search Chokil

3105
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:25,360
Add to the sound of the sir

3106
02:39:25,360 --> 02:39:30,360
Please stop it

3107
02:39:30,360 --> 02:39:33,360
Carlton!

3108
02:39:33,360 --> 02:39:36,360
Oklaine!

3109
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:38,240
Windows 4

3110
02:39:38,240 --> 02:40:08,040
Hey, Jebel, Jebel, if you're gone, I'll be sad, but one day I'll destroy my eyes, but hey, I'm happy with my life. Finally, I've entrusted it to you.

3111
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:16,240
Hey, you're my hope.

3112
02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:31,240
Once again, the sun's rays are spilling out of my arms.

3113
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:55,240
You taught me the meaning of my life, my destiny, and the greatness of being human - courage.

3114
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:15,240
The light that was received would seep in. In my heart, I felt as if I was both dead and breathing at the same time.

3115
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:22,240
From now on, I'm coming into you. Thank you very much.

3116
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:37,240
Everything is connected, everything has a body.

3117
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:54,240
This pain, this pain that I believed,

3118
02:41:55,240 --> 02:42:05,240
What your father gave you, what you gave you.

3119
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:17,240
I speak of the light of application in my mind.

3120
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:29,240
There is one thing that is so certain that it is in my heart right now.

3121
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:38,240
Embrace it, because this moves,

3122
02:42:39,240 --> 02:42:44,240
Look at the stars.

3123
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:56,240
What remains is the brilliance of humanity,

3124
02:42:57,240 --> 02:43:07,240
Light up the darkness and bring your return,

3125
02:43:07,240 --> 02:43:13,240
Come back,

3126
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:42,240
happiness.

3127
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:01,240
Can't you hear me?

3128
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:07,240
I hear a voice calling to you,

3129
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:13,240
I've already killed the past that I can't hear,

3130
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:17,240
Call my name.

3131
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:21,240
Unlike you.

3132
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:25,240
It's my fault.

3133
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:30,240
That changed until

3134
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:34,240
Laugh to live,

3135
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:38,240
Use and take everything,

3136
02:44:38,240 --> 02:44:41,240
Disobey justice,

3137
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:44,240
To all of Wasa,

3138
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:50,240
Use and take everything,

3139
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:53,240
Disobey justice,

3140
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:56,240
To all of Wasa,

3141
02:44:56,240 --> 02:45:00,240
You want me,

3142
02:45:00,240 --> 02:45:01,240
Laughing,

3143
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,240
I want it,

3144
02:45:03,240 --> 02:45:04,240
it is,

3145
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:08,240
it is,

3146
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:16,240
no one,

3147
02:45:23,240 --> 02:45:25,240
Here it comes,

3148
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:32,240
Well then,

3149
02:45:32,240 --> 02:45:36,240
Well then,

3150
02:45:37,240 --> 02:45:41,240
Is this the world you've left behind?

3151
02:45:43,240 --> 02:45:46,240
what,

3152
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:53,240
The world you lost long ago,

3153
02:45:53,240 --> 02:45:57,240
Is this a sad world hidden by dead people?

3154
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:05,240
It's a wonderful world where I control everything

3155
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,240
Lion

3156
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:12,240
Even history

3157
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:15,240
Is that why you have to steal from innocent people?

3158
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:24,240
A distant sacrifice for the future I envision

3159
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:28,240
You're just scared

3160
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:33,240
Humans

3161
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:36,240
That's why I gave up being human

3162
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,240
To get it

3163
02:46:46,240 --> 02:46:48,240
Beyond human

3164
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:59,240
All you need is results

3165
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:04,240
I won

3166
02:47:06,240 --> 02:47:09,240
The only result is that you are in control.

3167
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:13,240
It's all just a dream

3168
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:14,240
But

3169
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:19,240
How did you live?

3170
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:24,240
Paying to Fate

3171
02:47:25,240 --> 02:47:27,240
What did you leave behind?

3172
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:29,240
Rumbling, rumbling, rumbling

3173
02:47:35,240 --> 02:47:37,240
To me

3174
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:41,240
Give me strength

3175
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,240
dead

3176
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:55,240
Your

3177
02:47:57,240 --> 02:48:00,240
It's my father

3178
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:08,240
That's right

3179
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:17,240
smile

3180
02:48:19,240 --> 02:48:21,240
Going out as a faithful servant

3181
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:24,760
The current situation is

3182
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:28,740
To tell the story behind

3183
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:32,240
Ko how proprio

3184
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:35,240
Isn't that the best move?

3185
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:38,240
When I tell you the inside story like that,

3186
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:40,240
I've been forced to ask you out

3187
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:41,240
I'm good with tax

3188
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,240
shake alone

3189
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:45,320
hahhh

3190
02:48:45,580 --> 02:48:48,540
Finally, a name that stands out

3191
02:48:48,600 --> 02:48:50,840
What's left now

3192
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:53,260
2019

3193
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:57,860
That life is mine too

3194
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:01,220
務 manual you

3195
02:49:01,220 --> 02:49:04,140
But the light is certain

3196
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,740
Holy and low

3197
02:49:05,740 --> 02:49:07,680
merged

3198
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,560
for that

3199
02:49:09,560 --> 02:49:10,560
pain

3200
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:12,720
No problem

3201
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:20,220
I'll set my heart on fire to take everything

3202
02:49:20,220 --> 02:49:26,720
I've gained power, but this pain is gentle

3203
02:49:26,720 --> 02:49:31,520
This smile broke before, you're a sloppy person

3204
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:37,520
I stopped thinking about this smile, and it made my body freeze.

3205
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:40,520
Omelo, kill me

3206
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:46,520
Omelo, kill me

3207
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:51,520
You threw me away and taught me the best, so I'll pour in the bargain sale in front of the meaning of selling you

3208
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:56,520
Yes, I did it. I knocked my hand down. That's wrong.

3209
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:03,840
It's a little rough, but it's a good hand

3210
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:07,020
緊弱緊弱

3211
02:50:07,020 --> 02:50:11,020
Sasasa, no no

3212
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:16,020
It's so tense, but it's actually deceiving you

3213
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:17,220
JoJo

3214
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:23,020
Now you too will come to me, and death will resonate with you

3215
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:29,620
You ran away from humans

3216
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:33,940
What's not making me spill right now?

3217
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:38,080
This year just hit me

3218
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,580
I have surpassed humanity

3219
02:50:39,580 --> 02:50:41,420
I can't keep up with you guys

3220
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:45,600
I'm already curious, girl

3221
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:48,700
If there is a picture of the day of death,

3222
02:50:48,700 --> 02:50:50,940
Stop that heart

3223
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:55,140
Let's do it. Inlencer grows.

3224
02:50:55,140 --> 02:50:58,180
As long as there are humans

3225
02:50:58,180 --> 02:51:01,500
If you say that, you can just run away

3226
02:51:01,500 --> 02:51:04,540
Like right here

3227
02:51:04,540 --> 02:51:10,860
Let me sacrifice my life and reveal it to you

3228
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:14,020
That was on my hand

3229
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:17,060
Moderate street night

3230
02:51:17,060 --> 02:51:20,340
The place where I escaped

3231
02:51:20,340 --> 02:51:23,580
This very night

3232
02:51:23,580 --> 02:51:26,580
There are already people who have disappeared

3233
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:29,700
Recently, on the street

3234
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:33,380
Let me shed my life on this and reveal it to you.

3237
02:51:40,620 --> 02:51:42,860
I want to sleep

3238
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:45,620
I'll make anything happen

3239
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:47,900
Roughly

3240
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:49,660
Megan

3241
02:51:49,660 --> 02:51:52,180
The meaning of our relationship has been stripped away

3242
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:53,860
Yep.

3243
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,140
Yep.

3244
02:51:58,140 --> 02:52:01,820

Huh?

02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:13,660
That's why

3249
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:15,660
My body is hot!

02:53:55,660 --> 02:53:57,660
Up and down

3294
02:53:57,660 --> 02:53:58,660
second-mover

3295
02:53:58,660 --> 02:53:59,860
Female Female

3296
02:53:59,860 --> 02:54:00,660
The insertion

3297
02:54:00,660 --> 02:54:02,660
Married

3298
02:54:02,660 --> 02:54:03,660
The other person is

3299
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:05,660
Pendrcon species

3300
02:54:05,660 --> 02:54:06,660
More than a voice

3301
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:08,660
Einar Pendrkon

3302
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:10,660
Philisarnasilas

3303
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:12,660
Harem is from Wing Day

3304
02:54:12,660 --> 02:54:14,660
Heading to America in the beginning of the month

3305
02:54:14,660 --> 02:54:17,660
Sirisana Sirus

3306
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:20,660
Joster-san

3307
02:54:20,660 --> 02:54:21,660
Both of them

3308
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:23,660
push up

3309
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:24,660
I am

3310
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:25,660
Always Hey Prussie

3311
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:26,660
At this time

3312
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:27,660
I can hide my hands anywhere

3313
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:28,660
It's a ball

3314
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:30,660
Harnem

3315
02:54:30,660 --> 02:54:31,660
Miya did sign language

3316
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:33,660
Let's make it in season

3317
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:35,660
America is great

3318
02:54:35,660 --> 02:54:36,660
Someday I will too

3319
02:54:36,660 --> 02:54:39,660
Try guessing students in America!

3320
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:41,660
Shhhh!

3321
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:48,660
And then the fateful moment comes

3322
02:54:48,660 --> 02:54:52,660
Tell this story until the world is a flash

3323
02:54:52,660 --> 02:54:57,660
That's the job of this meddlesome YATII Speedwagon introduction.

3324
02:54:57,660 --> 02:55:02,660
But it's not for me to say that now.

3325
02:55:06,660 --> 02:55:19,660
On planet Meguru, where Eien prays for today

3326
02:55:19,660 --> 02:55:28,660
My hands are always touching yours

3327
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:31,660
How about it?

3328
02:55:32,660 --> 02:55:37,660
I'm happy you're here

3329
02:55:38,660 --> 02:55:42,660
It's the same for me, I introduced you to my father.

3330
02:55:43,660 --> 02:55:45,660
Now, let's go to the craftsman

3331
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:49,660
Intruder

3332
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:54,660
Oh no, the guest has returned.

3333
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:56,660
Don't forget to lock it

3334
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:03,660
[Retreat it to Eien with fire ash]

3335
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:05,660
【伝ir】

3336
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:13,660
I used him to collect it.

3337
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:17,660
Wagapodi

3338
02:56:18,660 --> 02:56:20,660
Here you go,

3339
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:22,660
JoJo

3340
02:56:24,660 --> 02:56:29,660
Therefore I will split this stone in pieces before you.

3341
02:56:29,660 --> 02:56:35,660
I now respect you for having made so many holes.

3342
02:56:35,660 --> 02:56:38,660
Because I realized that

3343
02:56:38,660 --> 02:56:43,660
If God controls destiny

3344
02:56:43,660 --> 02:56:48,660
There's no relationship more calculated than ours

3345
02:56:48,660 --> 02:56:53,660
I got this power because of you

3346
02:56:54,660 --> 02:56:57,660
Because you were there

3347
02:56:57,660 --> 02:57:01,660
I don't have it all

3348
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:03,660
How far are you?

3349
02:57:03,660 --> 02:57:07,660
That's why this is destiny

3350
02:57:07,660 --> 02:57:14,660
I got the body of the only person in the world I respect

3351
02:57:14,660 --> 02:57:18,660
Living forever in the prefecture

3352
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:21,660
JoJo

3353
02:57:21,660 --> 02:57:24,660
We are in this world

3354
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:28,660
Because we are one

3355
02:57:30,660 --> 02:57:36,660
Please try, try, try, try

3356
02:57:39,660 --> 02:57:43,660
From light to darkness, this is where I die

3357
02:57:43,660 --> 02:57:45,660
End it all

3358
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:48,660
Let's get it all started

3359
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,660
The world of Pingo

3360
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:52,660
No, John

3361
02:57:52,660 --> 02:57:57,660
I feel like I can't speak

3362
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:59,660
There's no breathing

3363
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:01,660
Only you

3364
02:58:01,660 --> 02:58:05,660
When the spirits scatter

3365
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:07,660
If you do that

3366
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:10,660
Elemental Creation

3367
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:13,660
Only this child

3368
02:58:13,660 --> 02:58:14,660
If you search

3369
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:16,660
How it works

3370
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,660
Can you get the dial?

3371
02:58:17,660 --> 02:58:18,660
nevertheless

3372
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:19,660
All people

3373
02:58:19,660 --> 02:58:20,660
I enjoyed it

3374
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:22,660
fun

3375
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:23,660
Need

3376
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:24,660
Not given

3377
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,660
That neck

3378
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:26,660
Right next to the iron steps

3379
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:27,660
Inaccuracy

3380
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:28,660
I won't forgive

3381
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:29,660
Long time

3382
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:30,660
John

3383
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:32,660
You

3384
02:58:32,660 --> 02:58:36,660
This child

3385
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:37,660
My

3386
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:39,660
This child

3387
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:41,660
This child

3388
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:44,660
This child

3389
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:46,660
Someone

3390
02:58:46,660 --> 02:58:47,660
all

3391
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:49,660
Dose

3392
02:58:49,660 --> 02:58:51,660
Dose

3393
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:53,660
Dose

3394
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:55,660
Dose

3395
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:57,660
Dose

3396
02:58:57,660 --> 02:59:00,660
Dose

3397
02:59:07,660 --> 02:59:14,660
Something inside me snapped, something decisive

3398
02:59:14,660 --> 02:59:16,660
Chomazo!

3399
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:18,660
This is it!

3400
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:20,660
Run away

3401
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:22,660
Chocho

3402
02:59:22,660 --> 02:59:30,660
Until I burn with you

3403
02:59:30,660 --> 02:59:40,660
Until everything disappears

3404
02:59:43,660 --> 02:59:47,660
Flames run, everything is connected

3405
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:49,660
Live for me

3406
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:51,660
All live

3407
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:54,660
Probably at the beginning

3408
02:59:54,660 --> 02:59:59,660
Now, I'm going to be in trouble.

3409
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:02,660
Maybe this time

3410
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:05,660
That's about it.

3411
03:00:08,660 --> 03:00:12,660
Sell ​​happily and live

3412
03:00:12,660 --> 03:00:18,660
But now something has snapped

3413
03:00:18,660 --> 03:00:23,660
Until you don't need it yet

3414
03:00:23,660 --> 03:00:26,660
Okay then

3415
03:00:32,660 --> 03:00:34,660
It's about you

3416
03:00:35,660 --> 03:00:37,660
Before I lose consciousness

3417
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:40,660
I thought it would come

3418
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:42,660
Speak

3419
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:44,660
Talk to me

3420
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:51,660
This guy

3421
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:56,660
Dead

3422
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,660
Dead

3423
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:22,660
Dead

3424
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:24,660
Dead

3425
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:26,660
Dead

3426
03:01:26,660 --> 03:01:28,660
Dead

3427
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:30,660
Dead

3428
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:31,660
Dead

3429
03:01:31,660 --> 03:01:37,660
His noble life

3430
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:41,660
Disappeared into the cruelty of him

3431
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:46,660
The destiny and adventure

3432
03:01:46,660 --> 03:01:48,660
Dead

3433
03:01:48,660 --> 03:01:50,660
Dead

3434
03:01:51,660 --> 03:01:56,660
Let's talk forever

3435
03:01:56,660 --> 03:01:59,660
Of course,

3436
03:01:59,660 --> 03:02:03,660
Something in my eyes

3437
03:02:09,660 --> 03:02:12,660
Two in One

3438
03:02:12,660 --> 03:02:16,660
Feeling the friendship of a dog

3439
03:02:16,660 --> 03:02:20,660
That's right

3440
03:02:20,660 --> 03:02:23,660
Without you

3441
03:02:23,660 --> 03:02:26,660
Because you were there

3442
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:28,660
something

3443
03:02:28,660 --> 03:02:32,660
Now I

3444
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:34,660
want

3445
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:37,660
Find

3446
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:40,660
To your favorite destiny

3447
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:44,660
Beautiful Mikade

3448
03:02:44,660 --> 03:02:47,660
In the stars

3449
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,660
I drink

3450
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:51,660
The two

3451
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:55,660
That fate

3452
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:57,660
It was terrible

3453
03:02:57,660 --> 03:02:59,660
Another breast

3454
03:02:59,660 --> 03:03:02,660
Quietly unknown

3455
03:03:02,660 --> 03:03:06,660
One saw the stars

3456
03:03:06,660 --> 03:03:34,660
Tour

3457
03:03:34,660 --> 03:03:38,140
Is it polar?

3458
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,120
pick up the station

3459
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:02,700
my frightenedzz

3460
03:04:02,700 --> 03:04:10,700
Speedwagon is so cool!

3461
03:04:12,700 --> 03:04:16,700
Yuishie, Yoishie!

3462
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3463
03:05:02,700 --> 03:05:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3464
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3465
03:06:02,700 --> 03:06:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3466
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3467
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3468
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3469
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3470
03:08:32,700 --> 03:08:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3471
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:06,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3472
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3473
03:10:02,700 --> 03:10:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3474
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:36,700
Yuisi, Yuisi!

3475
03:11:02,700 --> 03:11:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3476
03:11:32,700 --> 03:11:36,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3477
03:12:02,700 --> 03:12:06,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3478
03:12:32,700 --> 03:12:46,700
The best thing about this park was that the smiles of all the customers were the biggest smiles. I felt that very strongly at the park.

3479
03:12:46,700 --> 03:12:54,700
I was truly happy that such a miraculous park had been able to survive to the very end.

3480
03:12:54,700 --> 03:12:58,700
Thank you for watching.

3481
03:13:04,700 --> 03:13:08,700
Now, Mr. Kong, please.

3482
03:13:08,700 --> 03:13:12,700
Thank you for watching.

3483
03:13:12,700 --> 03:13:16,700
Great staff, great cast.

3484
03:13:16,700 --> 03:13:20,700
Then they brought the outbreak to the theater.

3485
03:13:20,700 --> 03:13:24,700
I'm glad to meet everyone who has watched the video.

3486
03:13:24,700 --> 03:13:26,700
I easily overcame the progression.

3487
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:28,700
The players were able to go home after today's academy.

3488
03:13:28,700 --> 03:13:32,700
I'm happy for people.

3489
03:13:32,700 --> 03:13:36,700
I let it happen.

3490
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:38,700
thank you.

3491
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:42,700
And I was struggling as a single person.

3492
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,700
My son!

3493
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:48,700
That's amazing!

3494
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:50,700
I'm so happy!

3495
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:52,700
I'm so happy!

3496
03:13:52,700 --> 03:13:56,700
It's great.

3497
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,700
It's great.

3498
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:00,700
thank you.

3499
03:14:00,700 --> 03:14:04,700
Then, I received the greeting I just mentioned.

3500
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:06,700
Thank you for watching.

3501
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:08,700
thank you very much.

3502
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:10,700
Thank you very much.

3503
03:14:10,700 --> 03:14:14,700
Everyone, please check out Fauci's Prround Funding.

3504
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:16,700
thank you.

3505
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:18,700
thank you.

3506
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,700
thank you.

3507
03:14:20,700 --> 03:14:22,700
please.

3508
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:24,700
Everyone, you all were wonderful.

3509
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:26,700
It was wonderful.

3510
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:28,700
See you at the theater from there.

3511
03:14:28,700 --> 03:14:30,700
Thank you very much.

3512
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:36,700
He doesn't even know!

3513
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:38,700
He doesn't know either.

3514
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:40,700
He doesn't know either.

3515
03:14:40,700 --> 03:14:42,700
He doesn't know either.

3516
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:46,700
So Misha, please.

3517
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:48,700
yes.

3518
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:50,700
It was a huge hurdle.

3519
03:14:50,700 --> 03:14:54,700
I'm not sure if I can speak well,

3520
03:14:54,700 --> 03:14:58,700
This is Elina Tendul and her character Shimis Misha.

3521
03:15:02,700 --> 03:15:06,700
Thank you very much for coming to the audience today.

3522
03:15:06,700 --> 03:15:10,700
And thank you to everyone who watched the stream.

3523
03:15:10,700 --> 03:15:12,700
What should I say?

3524
03:15:12,700 --> 03:15:16,700
I was able to reach this great war retreat,

3525
03:15:16,700 --> 03:15:18,700
The strength of each and every cast member,

3526
03:15:18,700 --> 03:15:20,700
With the staff and

3527
03:15:20,700 --> 03:15:22,700
For supporting this work,

3528
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:26,700
I think it's all thanks to you all.

3529
03:15:34,700 --> 03:15:36,700
Please do, everyone.

3530
03:15:44,700 --> 03:15:46,700
Please look at the stars, everyone.

3531
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:52,700
So please have a great war.

3532
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:54,700
yes.

3533
03:15:54,700 --> 03:15:56,700
It's your job to burn the speeder!

3534
03:16:00,700 --> 03:16:04,700
It was my first experience and it was really difficult for me.

3535
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,700
But really.

3536
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:08,700
It was really hard, but

3537
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:10,700
Already, somehow,

3538
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:12,700
To get support,

3539
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:14,700
Thanks,

3540
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:16,700
It was really hard, but

3541
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:18,700
Already, somehow,

3542
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:20,700
To get support,

3543
03:16:20,700 --> 03:16:22,700
Like supporting them,

3544
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:24,700
Supporting each other,

3545
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:26,700
Those words truly mean,

3546
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
It just seemed to enter my body.

3547
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:30,700
It's a really wonderful place,

3548
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:32,700
Thanks to that,

3549
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:34,700
I was able to cut it thickly.

3550
03:16:34,700 --> 03:16:38,700
So, I have nothing but the best to say,

3551
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:40,700
With everyone here on stage,

3552
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:42,700
As Kochi-san also said,

3553
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:44,700
Not at all.

3554
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,700
Although he's not here now,

3555
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:48,700
The staff who helped me create it,

3556
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:50,700
and,

3557
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:52,700
This role,

3558
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:54,700
For five months,

3559
03:16:54,700 --> 03:16:56,700
I really put it together,

3560
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:58,700
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

3561
03:16:58,700 --> 03:17:00,700
Love women,

3562
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:02,700
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

3563
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:04,700
Including everyone who loves me,

3564
03:17:04,700 --> 03:17:06,700
Really,

3565
03:17:06,700 --> 03:17:08,700
thank you very much!

3566
03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:16,700
Shirae-san...

3567
03:17:16,700 --> 03:17:18,700
Good job, Dig putting is burning well.

3568
03:17:18,700 --> 03:17:21,700
I certainly understand.

3569
03:17:21,700 --> 03:17:22,700
Honchitsu,

3570
03:17:22,700 --> 03:17:26,700
To Sepulija,

3571
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:28,700
To Sepulija,

3572
03:17:28,700 --> 03:17:29,940
RPM improved office

3573
03:17:29,940 --> 03:17:31,700
Wang's school committee came to the event.

3574
03:17:31,700 --> 03:17:32,700
Thank you for your continued support.

3575
03:17:32,700 --> 03:17:34,700
Thank you very much.

3576
03:17:36,700 --> 03:17:37,700
Really,

3577
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:39,700
The first thought is,

3578
03:17:39,700 --> 03:17:42,700
There were a lot of different things that happened.

3579
03:17:42,700 --> 03:17:45,700
The two of them, Shotaro, and now, here

3580
03:17:45,700 --> 03:17:48,700
The one who finished the tree, and another Teperi,

3581
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:52,700
Hiro-kun and I accomplished so much on our own.

3582
03:17:52,700 --> 03:17:55,700
Mom, this company is a one-lens camera for people.

3583
03:17:55,700 --> 03:17:58,700
With the determination to align

3584
03:17:58,700 --> 03:18:00,700
I came here with the aim of becoming a teacher of Wang's music.

3585
03:18:00,700 --> 03:18:03,700
Really, without anyone calling

3586
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:05,700
Of course, I'm really grateful that I've come this far.

3587
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:08,700
Medical support from staff

3588
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:10,700
It is the result of your efforts.

3589
03:18:10,700 --> 03:18:12,700
Every single stage, really

3590
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:14,700
I just want to omit it.

3591
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:15,700
Every single stage, really

3592
03:18:15,700 --> 03:18:18,700
The applause of the Baraline and 5000 yen are us

3593
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:20,700
Now the cast is

3594
03:18:20,700 --> 03:18:22,700
The truth is, it's your Hamon energy.

3595
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:24,700
How much courage it gave us

3596
03:18:24,700 --> 03:18:27,700
I think that's what we really feel.

3597
03:18:27,700 --> 03:18:31,700
I was really close to Hantoshi and Okabetsu right now.

3598
03:18:31,700 --> 03:18:34,700
It really is like a family

3599
03:18:34,700 --> 03:18:37,700
It means that today will be a valley from tomorrow onwards.

3600
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:39,700
Hey hey

3601
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:41,700
Annie

3602
03:18:41,700 --> 03:18:45,700
A little Syriaria please

3603
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:47,700
Just a little bit

3604
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:49,700
I feel lonely though

3605
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:51,700
I really love myself

3606
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:52,700
This woman's world

3607
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:54,700
And with these beloved members

3608
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:56,700
In this theater

3609
03:18:56,700 --> 03:18:58,700
Being able to breathe the same air

3610
03:18:58,700 --> 03:19:00,700
That's right.

3611
03:19:00,700 --> 03:19:03,700
The one who touched everyone's hearts was

3612
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:09,700
I have become a treasure too

3613
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,700
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

3614
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:13,700
Thank you so much everyone

3615
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:15,700
thank you

3616
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:17,700
It will end again

3617
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:19,700
Blatzer

3618
03:19:23,700 --> 03:19:25,700
Please watch

3619
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:31,700
I changed my boss's environment.

3620
03:19:31,700 --> 03:19:32,700
Another ironworker

3621
03:19:32,700 --> 03:19:34,700
Thank you for today

3622
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:39,700
It's totally free

3623
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:41,700
So many

3624
03:19:41,700 --> 03:19:44,700
As you have written earlier,

3625
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:46,700
Right from here on

3626
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:48,700
As in the title above

3627
03:19:48,700 --> 03:19:51,700
It was a strange adventure.

3628
03:19:51,700 --> 03:19:56,700
There are so many people like you.

3629
03:19:56,700 --> 03:19:57,700
Only the curtain of Hara

3630
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:59,700
Born at the Imperial Theatre

3631
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,700
The Imperial Theatre

3632
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,700
The current theater is closing.

3633
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:05,700
As a final review

3634
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,700
By producing

3635
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:09,700
Not Minami

3636
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:11,700
Memories

3637
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:13,700
Participated

3638
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:15,700
My friends are cast members here.

3639
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,700
It is staff

3640
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:19,700
And the original author

3641
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:21,700
The main cast members

3642
03:20:21,700 --> 03:20:23,700
And here are the books.

3643
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,700
After five years of work

3644
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:27,700
Apparently it was rewritten 17 times.

3645
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:29,700
It was in this flow that I was born.

3646
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:31,700
This work

3647
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:33,700
Being accepted by everyone like this

3648
03:20:33,700 --> 03:20:34,700
Like this

3649
03:20:34,700 --> 03:20:35,700
Many musicals

3650
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:37,700
We have some works from overseas.

3651
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:38,700
Such works are

3652
03:20:38,700 --> 03:20:39,700
Zahiozic Zero is

3653
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,700
On Broadway and in the West End

3654
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:43,700
That's what we're here for

3655
03:20:43,700 --> 03:20:44,700
In books

3656
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:46,700
While making large replicas

3657
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:48,700
Let's fight

3658
03:20:48,700 --> 03:20:49,700
Japanese style

3659
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:51,700
We provide information.

3660
03:20:51,700 --> 03:20:52,700
This work is

3661
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:53,700
What you all saw

3662
03:20:53,700 --> 03:20:54,700
Exactly

3663
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:56,700
From zero to one

3664
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:57,700
Became Zahiozic

3665
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:59,700
I think it's a work of art.

3666
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:00,700
This work

3667
03:21:00,700 --> 03:21:01,700
Someday again

3668
03:21:01,700 --> 03:21:03,700
Inherited

3669
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:05,700
It may be a big performance,

3670
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:07,700
This Zahiozik

3671
03:21:07,700 --> 03:21:08,700
I was at Zero 1

3672
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:09,700
The friends here

3673
03:21:09,700 --> 03:21:10,700
Really I

3674
03:21:10,700 --> 03:21:11,700
It's just for the time being.

3675
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:13,700
Zayn

3676
03:21:13,700 --> 03:21:16,700
I feel like a son or daughter to you.

3677
03:21:16,700 --> 03:21:22,700
Only one person was different

3678
03:21:22,700 --> 03:21:25,700
Since they share the same father

3679
03:21:25,700 --> 03:21:28,700
One as a father

3680
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:30,700
Mud and Stars

3681
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:31,700
University

3682
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:32,700
A work ticket

3683
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:33,700
As a friend

3684
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:34,700
from now on

3685
03:21:34,700 --> 03:21:35,700
At the Shibutoku Musical

3686
03:21:35,700 --> 03:21:37,700
I want to survive

3687
03:21:42,700 --> 03:21:43,700
Truly amazing

3688
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:45,700
Two sons

3689
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:46,700
Like this

3690
03:21:46,700 --> 03:21:48,700
I can have it

3691
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:49,700
A little bit today

3692
03:21:49,700 --> 03:21:50,700
You might be watching from anywhere

3693
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:51,700
Also serving

3694
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:52,700
As a son

3695
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:54,700
Nice to meet you

3696
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:55,700
Truly amazing

3697
03:21:55,700 --> 03:21:56,700
Yesterday

3698
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:57,700
As a father

3699
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:58,700
I was able to participate

3700
03:21:58,700 --> 03:21:59,700
Hello everyone

3701
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:01,700
If you have any worries

3702
03:22:01,700 --> 03:22:02,700
Finally

3703
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:03,700
What is it?

3704
03:22:03,700 --> 03:22:04,700
Within myself

3705
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:06,700
It's all connected

3706
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:08,700
That it all has meaning

3707
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:09,700
a little bit

3708
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:10,700
If you think so

3709
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:11,700
surely

3710
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:12,700
Beyond that

3711
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:13,700
There is light

3712
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:14,700
There are stars

3713
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:15,700
If you think so

3714
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:17,700
I think it's that kind of work.

3715
03:22:17,700 --> 03:22:18,700
thank you

3716
03:22:26,700 --> 03:22:27,700
Well then

3717
03:22:27,700 --> 03:22:28,700
I will do my best

3718
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:40,700
Where should I start?

3719
03:22:40,700 --> 03:22:41,700
Already

3720
03:22:47,700 --> 03:22:48,700
But anyway

3721
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:56,700
I'm glad we met

3722
03:22:56,700 --> 03:22:58,700
Hotz

3723
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:08,700
We

3724
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:09,700
Entertainment and

3725
03:23:09,700 --> 03:23:11,700
I'm trying not to

3726
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:14,700
Sometimes after all

3727
03:23:14,700 --> 03:23:15,700
There are times when it's difficult

3728
03:23:22,700 --> 03:23:23,700
There are times when it's scary

3729
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,700
but

3730
03:23:25,700 --> 03:23:27,700
The Minister just said

3731
03:23:27,700 --> 03:23:28,700
As you said

3732
03:23:28,700 --> 03:23:29,700
Something

3733
03:23:29,700 --> 03:23:30,700
In the purely literal sense

3734
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:32,700
Don't do it right away

3735
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:35,700
In the truest sense

3736
03:23:35,700 --> 03:23:36,700
Do it now

3737
03:23:36,700 --> 03:23:38,700
That's what it means

3738
03:23:40,700 --> 03:23:41,700
I am this

3739
03:23:41,700 --> 03:23:43,700
I felt it at Campari.

3740
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:45,700
of course

3741
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:52,700
A lot of things happened

3742
03:23:52,700 --> 03:23:53,700
Something like that

3743
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:57,700
Only in those words

3744
03:23:57,700 --> 03:23:59,700
I might not be able to tell you right now, but

3745
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:02,700
And more

3746
03:24:02,700 --> 03:24:03,700
I

3747
03:24:03,700 --> 03:24:04,700
now

3748
03:24:07,700 --> 03:24:08,700
As a treasure

3749
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:10,700
I was able to have

3750
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:11,700
Above all

3751
03:24:11,700 --> 03:24:12,700
It

3752
03:24:12,700 --> 03:24:13,700
so

3753
03:24:15,700 --> 03:24:16,700
lots of

3754
03:24:18,700 --> 03:24:20,700
To humans

3755
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:28,700
That you can enjoy it

3756
03:24:28,700 --> 03:24:29,700
After all, it's ours

3757
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:31,700
It's the happiest thing

3758
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,700
It

3759
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:34,700
With this member

3760
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:36,700
It can be closed on paper

3761
03:24:36,700 --> 03:24:38,700
I am happy

3762
03:24:39,700 --> 03:24:40,700
Women

3763
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:42,700
Giant player fun

3764
03:24:42,700 --> 03:24:44,700
I welcomed

3765
03:24:46,700 --> 03:24:47,700
My father just now

3766
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:49,700
As you said

3767
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:51,700
We will continue to do so

3768
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:53,700
Look forward

3769
03:24:53,700 --> 03:24:54,700
Surely soon

3770
03:24:54,700 --> 03:24:56,700
Each on their own path

3771
03:24:56,700 --> 03:24:57,700
Various expressions

3772
03:24:59,700 --> 03:25:01,700
I think I'll pursue it

3773
03:25:02,700 --> 03:25:03,700
Not yet

3774
03:25:04,700 --> 03:25:06,700
It will be useful

3775
03:25:09,700 --> 03:25:10,700
Dad too

3776
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:17,700
Let's definitely meet again

3777
03:25:17,700 --> 03:25:18,700
and

3778
03:25:19,700 --> 03:25:20,700
Also this woman

3779
03:25:20,700 --> 03:25:22,700
I think it would be a good story if we could meet.

3780
03:25:25,700 --> 03:25:27,700
It's all connected

3781
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:32,700
I dream of such a day

3782
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,700
Today is really

3783
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:34,700
To everyone

3784
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:35,700
I want to express my gratitude

3785
03:25:35,700 --> 03:25:36,700
everyone

3786
03:25:36,700 --> 03:25:37,700
thank you

3787
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:48,700
amazing

3788
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:49,700
I'll say something good.

3789
03:25:55,700 --> 03:25:58,700
I think Bappy will decide.

3790
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:00,700
thank you

3791
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:02,700
Woman

3792
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:03,700
I pushed the woman down.

3793
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:04,700
This is Arisa Shotaro

3794
03:26:08,700 --> 03:26:09,700
everyone

3795
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:10,700
Really

3796
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:13,700
Those who noticed

3797
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:14,700
I don't know, but

3798
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,700
I

3799
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:18,700
Because I'm this kind of person

3800
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:20,700
Even if I stand in the middle

3801
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:22,700
After all, everyone

3802
03:26:22,700 --> 03:26:23,700
Many people

3803
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:25,700
For holding me and supporting me

3804
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:26,700
already

3805
03:26:27,700 --> 03:26:28,700
Warm

3806
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:30,700
Someone like my older brother

3807
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:31,700
He was already a family man

3808
03:26:31,700 --> 03:26:32,700
People like

3809
03:26:32,700 --> 03:26:33,700
Because that's fine for you

3810
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:35,700
You can go with that humanity

3811
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:36,700
Just those words are enough

3812
03:26:36,700 --> 03:26:38,700
I really have come this far

3813
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:40,700
But still

3814
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:42,700
When I look around,

3815
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:44,700
After all, this time everyone

3816
03:26:45,700 --> 03:26:46,700
After all

3817
03:26:46,700 --> 03:26:48,700
Cress

3818
03:26:48,700 --> 03:26:50,700
I've seen your face after all

3819
03:26:50,700 --> 03:26:51,700
Really everyone

3820
03:26:51,700 --> 03:26:52,700
too

3821
03:26:52,700 --> 03:26:54,700
After all, the curtain won't open

3822
03:26:54,700 --> 03:26:57,700
There were many things that caused me anxiety.

3823
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:58,700
I think there is.

3824
03:26:58,700 --> 03:26:59,700
That voice also reached me

3825
03:26:59,700 --> 03:27:01,700
It arrived directly after all

3826
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:04,700
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3827
03:27:05,700 --> 03:27:06,700
What's going on?

3828
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:08,700
Ride and enjoy

3829
03:27:08,700 --> 03:27:09,700
There are various messages

3830
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:11,700
I saw the power of seeing.

3831
03:27:11,700 --> 03:27:12,700
just

3832
03:27:12,700 --> 03:27:14,700
I

3833
03:27:15,700 --> 03:27:17,700
I really believe in everyone

3834
03:27:18,700 --> 03:27:19,700
I'm working hard here

3835
03:27:19,700 --> 03:27:20,700
Because I've been watching everyone

3836
03:27:22,700 --> 03:27:24,700
Watch it.

3837
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:25,700
Feelings

3838
03:27:26,700 --> 03:27:28,700
I just want you to wear it

3839
03:27:28,700 --> 03:27:30,700
That's really the only feeling

3840
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:32,700
Not

3841
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:33,700
Together

3842
03:27:33,700 --> 03:27:35,200
There are so many different

3843
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:36,700
Overcoming a big wall

3844
03:27:36,700 --> 03:27:37,700
already

3845
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:39,700
Even if the conversation doesn't change

3846
03:27:39,700 --> 03:27:40,700
Invisible

3847
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:42,700
It's a bond

3848
03:27:42,700 --> 03:27:43,700
That's already the case

3849
03:27:43,700 --> 03:27:44,700
Don don don don

3850
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:46,700
That means we're connected

3851
03:27:46,700 --> 03:27:48,700
I've been feeling this trend for a long time now

3852
03:27:49,700 --> 03:27:50,700
After all

3853
03:27:50,700 --> 03:27:51,700
Makuha is open

3854
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:53,700
Jonah Joshi's

3855
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:55,700
What is the other Yuya-san?

3856
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:57,700
Really

3857
03:27:57,700 --> 03:28:00,700
We've talked about a lot of things up until today

3858
03:28:00,700 --> 03:28:02,700
Yesterday's Yuya's war loss

3859
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:04,700
Watching Hiro's wartime success

3860
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:06,700
After all,

3861
03:28:06,700 --> 03:28:08,700
There was today

3862
03:28:09,700 --> 03:28:10,700
One more

3863
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:13,700
I feel like I've really completed it.

3864
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:15,700
I got into the mood.

3865
03:28:15,700 --> 03:28:18,700
I've seen some really amazing things

3866
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:19,700
on second thoughts

3867
03:28:19,700 --> 03:28:20,700
I'm glad I worked hard

3868
03:28:20,700 --> 03:28:21,700
Really already

3869
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:23,700
As of yesterday, I felt

3870
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:24,700
So today, everyone

3871
03:28:24,700 --> 03:28:25,700
so

3872
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:27,700
I can see that face in Chi-up

3873
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:29,700
Really I

3874
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:31,700
With a heartfelt joy

3875
03:28:31,700 --> 03:28:32,700
There are lots

3876
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:34,700
As it was at the beginning

3877
03:28:34,700 --> 03:28:35,700
I

3878
03:28:35,700 --> 03:28:38,700
I think it's a historic evolution.

3879
03:28:38,700 --> 03:28:39,700
To the world

3880
03:28:39,700 --> 03:28:40,700
Really already

3881
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:42,700
We all worked hard to create it

3882
03:28:42,700 --> 03:28:43,700
already

3883
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:45,700
This guy

3884
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:46,700
This guy gave it to me in the field.

3885
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:47,700
Together

3886
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:48,700
I want to keep up

3887
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:49,700
already

3888
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:50,700
try as hard as one can

3889
03:28:50,700 --> 03:28:51,700
Climb, climb, climb, climb up the mountain

3890
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:53,700
today

3891
03:28:53,700 --> 03:28:54,700
Really

3892
03:28:54,700 --> 03:28:56,700
I think I was able to make everyone happy.

3893
03:28:56,700 --> 03:28:57,700
Thank you so much

3894
03:29:07,700 --> 03:29:09,700
Me too

3895
03:29:09,700 --> 03:29:10,700
Really

3896
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:12,700
I spoke without thinking

3897
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:13,700
Maybe

3898
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:14,700
no

3899
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:15,700
That's not true

3900
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:18,700
Some people may think that

3901
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:20,700
This is definitely

3902
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:21,700
already

3903
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:22,700
It's my feelings

3904
03:29:22,700 --> 03:29:24,700
Campari's feelings

3905
03:29:24,700 --> 03:29:25,700
I

3906
03:29:25,700 --> 03:29:26,700
today

3907
03:29:26,700 --> 03:29:28,700
It may be a mistake

3908
03:29:28,700 --> 03:29:30,700
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3909
03:29:39,700 --> 03:29:41,700
It's okay to think that

3910
03:29:43,700 --> 03:29:45,700
Me too

3911
03:29:49,700 --> 03:29:50,700
Me too

3912
03:29:50,700 --> 03:29:57,700
where

3913
03:29:57,700 --> 03:30:01,700
Me too

3914
03:30:04,700 --> 03:30:06,700
Everyone did their best.

3915
03:30:07,700 --> 03:30:10,700
everyone

3916
03:30:10,700 --> 03:30:12,700

3917
03:30:12,700 --> 03:30:14,700

3918
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:16,700
thank you

3919
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:31,700
I

3920
03:30:31,700 --> 03:30:33,700
To dry this

3921
03:30:33,700 --> 03:30:35,700
Also

3922
03:30:35,700 --> 03:30:51,700
I hope that I will be able to meet you all in person soon. I also hope that this work will continue to remain not only in Japan, but all over the world.

3923
03:30:55,700 --> 03:30:59,700
I want to teach with big dreams.

3924
03:31:00,700 --> 03:31:02,700
Thank you very much.

3925
03:31:08,700 --> 03:31:13,700
So, I hope to finish it again soon, and thank you for watching today.
