Danny is the Joestar household’s

And one more thing—

I hate dogs.
{\ O (rank)}

Keep your stupid dog away from me!

My mother taught me well. She

<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

{\ O (gap)}

{\ T: One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

384
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,999
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (spread)}

385
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

386

Here is my question for you:

What was the first thing they

{\ O (spread)}

390
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,999
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread)}

Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank)}

I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I think I saw mud}

397
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: Why do you think so?}

398
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they have no choice but to die for their master.}

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: If you're dead, you can't accomplish anything.}

400
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: So no matter how many plans I had, I felt I had to live and do something.}

401
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (rank)}

They held onto their honour!

The names of those two knights

{\ O (spread)}

00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,984
So what!
{\ O (spread)}

405
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,999
So what?
{\ O (spread)}

406
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

407
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,083
But they—
{\ O (spread)}

408
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

409
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:09,649
They were left empty-handed

{\ O (spread)}

410
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:10,999
Such regret...
{\ O (spread)}

00:27:10,000 --> 00:26:48,999
I think...
{\ O (spread)}

412
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: That soul-dissolving powerlessness}

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: All they saw was mud.}

414
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: They teach us lessons about what we can do with our lives.}

415
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,141
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread)}

416
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,587
They were looking at the stars! I think

<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2086
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:21,850
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2087
02:27:22,428 --> 02:27:27,504
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2088
02:27:27,608 --> 02:27:32,712
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2089
02:27:32,811 --> 02:27:37,508
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2090
02:27:37,596 --> 02:27:43,129
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2091
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:47,074
<i>As though it were alive!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2092
02:27:47,138 --> 02:27:49,499
<i>And that is the story,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2093
02:27:49,562 --> 02:27:58,027
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2094
02:28:00,789 --> 02:28:09,146
<i>Until the very end!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2095
02:28:09,573 --> 02:28:11,511
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!
{\ O (spread)}

2096
02:28:11,561 --> 02:28:13,403
Oh, what loyal hearts!
{\ O (spread)}

2097
02:28:13,458 --> 02:28:16,373
But those two should
have done a better job!
{\ O (spread)}

2098
02:28:16,435 --> 02:28:19,223
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

2099
02:28:19,254 --> 02:28:21,670
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!
{\ O (spread)}

2100
02:28:21,728 --> 02:28:24,429
It might be as you say, however—
{\ O (spread)}

2101
02:28:24,486 --> 02:28:26,814
There is nothing that is without meaning.
{\ O (spread)}

2102
02:28:26,877 --> 02:28:30,430
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.
{\ O (spread)}

2103
02:28:30,726 --> 02:28:32,385
Everything is connected!
{\ O (spread)}

2104
02:28:32,420 --> 02:28:36,692
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2107
02:28:48,962 --> 02:28:54,293
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2108
02:28:54,405 --> 02:29:02,274
<i>Either one—</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2109

02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: It could be said that it was a pointless death}

2112
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
I turned those two
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: You may be right.}

2113
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: But nothing is meaningless}

2114
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: The same goes for when you came to this house.}

2115
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
It can’t be!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: It's all connected}

2116
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:25,340
Such grotesque forms!
{\ O (spread)}

2117
02:29:25,473 --> 02:29:40,762
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!
{\ O (spread)}

2118
02:29:42,963 --> 02:29:50,390
Don’t you think so?
{\ O (spread)}

2119
02:29:53,923 --> 02:30:02,673
Kill them all!
{\ O (spread)}

2120
02:30:03,545 --> 02:30:11,019
Continue from where
you left off on that day!
{\ O (spread)}

2121
02:30:11,192 --> 02:30:14,816
Tarkus!
{\ O (spread)}

2122
02:30:14,856 --> 02:30:18,272
Bruford!
{\ O (spread)}

2123
02:30:20,076 --> 02:30:31,059
Play me a fanfare with their screams!
{\ O (spread)}

2124
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
Our grudge!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: To avenge a grudge}

2125
02:30:33,059 --> 02:30:33,059
Your pride, your resentment.
{\ O (spread)}

2126
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,060
I can’t even imagine it!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: What an embarrassing sight}

2127
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,236
Our pride!
{\ O (spread)}

2128
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:43,437
But I also bear my own burdens!
{\ O (spread)}

2129
02:30:35,260 --> 02:30:37,059
Great Dark Knight Bruford!
{\ O (spread)}

2130
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:39,060
And you, Tarkus!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Don't you think so?}

2131
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:33,059
The way you feel—
{\ O (spread)}

2132
02:30:43,671 --> 02:30:51,757
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!
{\ O (spread)}

Tarkus!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Tarkus}

02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:52,285
I won’t let you interfere!
{\ O (spread)}

02:30:52,527 --> 02:31:01,059
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!
{\ O (spread)}

2136

My master—I, Bruford,
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Pride, the great wrestler Bruford}

2137
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:05,286
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!
{\ O (spread)}

2138
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:03,060
That man’s pride...
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Your thoughts and pride}

02:31:03,060 --> 02:30:57,059
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

Alright, go ahead!
{\ O (spread)}

2141
02:31:11,981 --> 02:31:14,265
We’ll duel as knights!
{\ O (spread)}

2142
02:31:14,703 --> 02:31:26,553
<i>A wedge driven into the

Don’t come any closer!

Damn it...
{\ O (spread)}

2149
02:31:51,021 --> 02:31:52,537
Fucking hell!
{\ O (spread)}

Honourable knight,

Is revenge your answer?
{\ O (spread)}

2158

Is that what you take pride in?
{\ O (spread)}

If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!
{\ O (spread)}

02:32:30,095 --> 02:32:32,053
You can lecture me after you win!

Let it somehow be restored!
{\ O (spread)}

02:33:51,042 --> 02:33:55,219
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

This pain means nothing to me!

Why aren’t you moving?

Pain?

That’s why...

I stopped fighting you.
{\ O (rank)}

That’s why you stopped your sword.

You are a great knight.

You are human!

So this is what it means to be human?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Is this a human?}

2196
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel

{\ O (rank)}

Pluck!

What the...
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: what}

2212
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!
{\ O (rank)}

Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.
{\ O (spread)}

First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,
{\ O (spread)}

2620
03:11:02,390 --> 03:11:05,085
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

{\ O (spread)}

2623
03:11:13,644 --> 03:11:17,502
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:11:17,556 --> 03:11:19,306
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:11:19,369 --> 03:11:24,802
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:11:24,863 --> 03:11:26,129
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:11:26,181 --> 03:11:30,343
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within

03:12:03,346 --> 03:12:06,167
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread)}

You were just that wonderful.
