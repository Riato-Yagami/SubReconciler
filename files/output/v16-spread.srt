{\ O (rank): Let's get back to the topic}

was created to support various fields,
{\ O (spread): As you all know,}

Now, listen carefully.
{\ O (rank): Please listen carefully}

this foundation here in the USA,
{\ O (gap): I founded this foundation here in the United States and have branches all over the world.}

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,880
And created our branches around the world...
{\ O (gap): It's to pursue the secret of something.}

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,520
That secret is...
{\ O (gap): What is that something?}

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
The Stone Mask.
{\ O (rank): Stone Mask}

36
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:27,840

{\ O (spread): The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.}

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,320
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.
{\ O (gap): And today, I'm recording the story of the mask.}

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,200

of the golden spirit I once knew.
{\ O (rank): And the story of the golden spirit that was there}

39

It all began in the 13th century.
{\ O (rank): It began in the 16th century}

41
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:57,096
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.
{\ O (spread): tribes of the central plateau of Mexico}

42
00:03:57,096 --> 00:04:00,244
They were members of the

{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.}

That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!
{\ O (spread): I'll warm you up, Hey Kelly}

{\ O (gap): Let me introduce you to my friend Danny.}

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!
{\ O (gap): It's a very useful shape.}

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It won't bite so it's okay.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Friend?
{\ O (rank): friend?}

291
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,332
Yeah!
{\ O (spread): Danny!}

292
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:31,998
Danny! What was that for!
{\ O (spread): You won’t get away with this!}

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.
{\ O (rank): I've been waiting for you, Diobrando.}

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Lord Joestar!

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Something wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread): Come inside!}

296
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah, nothing.
{\ O (spread): From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.}

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.
{\ O (rank): You must be tired from traveling all the way from London, Dio.}

298
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,760
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.
{\ O (spread): Starting today, you are part of our family.}

299
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.
{\ O (rank): Yes, I am grateful for Lord Joestar's actions.}

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Mister Brando!
{\ O (gap): Hehehehe.}

301
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I’m Police Inspector Archer!
{\ O (rank): Brand, this is Inspector Archer.}

302
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,760
Police? Has something happened?
{\ O (rank): Police? Did something happen?}

303
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:23,450
Oh, no!
{\ O (spread): Yes, no, I've known Lord Joestar for a long time.}

304
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,795
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.
{\ O (spread): I heard Danny crying earlier.}

305
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:28,140
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...
{\ O (spread): It came over suddenly, so the teacher was surprised and it ended up hitting my leg.}

306
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,485
Ah, that was—
{\ O (spread): Danny is an excellent watchdog for the Joestar family.}

307
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,830
-He came at me so suddenly.
{\ O (spread): He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.}

308
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,175
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (spread): JoJo, enough about Danny.}

309
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:37,520
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (spread): Yes!}

310
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,056
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!}

311
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,824
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?
{\ O (spread): Make sure to get along with each other.}

312
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:48,592
Yes, sir.
{\ O (spread): Now, allow me to show you to your room.}

313
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:51,360
Good.
{\ O (spread): Mister Brando!}

314
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
Hehehehe.

315
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Nice to have met you!
{\ O (rank): nice to meet you!}

316
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080
Yeah.

317
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,320
Now then, let me get—
{\ O (spread): Hehehehehehehehehe.}

318
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,400
Watch it!
{\ O (spread): See you, JoJo.}

319
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,520
So this is me.

320
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
Gearsk!

321
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don’t touch my bag!
{\ O (rank): Don't touch my bag.}

322
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,420
I was just trying to carry it for—
{\ O (rank): I'll try to carry it}

323
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,120
That’s enough.
{\ O (gap): 結構}

324
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.
{\ O (rank): Your hands are sticky with dog drool}

325
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
Sorry

326
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,120
I don't want you to touch me.

327
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
Ta-ta, JoJo!
{\ O (rank): Listen, JoJo}

328
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,780
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!
{\ O (spread): Let me start by saying}

329
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,460
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.
{\ O (spread): I like number one the most}

330
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,140
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!
{\ O (spread): I won't let anyone act intimidating in front of me.}

331
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,820
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!
{\ O (spread): I was only trying to be friendly!}

332
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?
{\ O (rank): What are you both doing?}

333
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ O (rank): One more thing}

334
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (rank): I hate dogs}

335
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:19,720
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.
{\ O (spread): The attitude of those who fawn over humans}

336
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
i am coming

337
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Keep your stupid dog away from me!
{\ O (spread): The insects are running}

338
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
thus

339
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
The two boys meet

340
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
The two of them begin their youth

341
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Also

342
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread): Don't let that stupid dog get close to me}

343
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:46,120
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.
{\ O (spread): Sir Josser}

344
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?
{\ O (rank): Here comes JoJo}

345
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,870
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (spread): Dioc}

346
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,245
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread): Is that okay?}

347
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,620
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>
{\ O (spread): We are}

348
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,995
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>
{\ O (spread): As a highly respected aristocrat}

349
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,370
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>
{\ O (spread): real}

350
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
for that

351
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
I have to learn

352
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,745
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>
{\ O (spread): Gentlemen}

353
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Take care of yourself

354
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
You have to be smart

355
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Logic

356
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:14,120
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Make your goal your mission}

357
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Terrified

358
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
To not lose

359
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (rank): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

360
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,720
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>
{\ O (spread): Whatever happens}

361
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,520
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread): To reign}

362
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
JoJo

363
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,320
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread): Those born together}

364
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Same again

365
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I was wrong.

366
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,120
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

367
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>
{\ O (rank): How many times has this happened?}

368
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
This is the sixth time.

369
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>
{\ O (rank): All uses are correct}

370
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:46,564
It’s just because I love reading so much!
{\ O (spread): I liked reading books}

371
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:50,786
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!
{\ O (spread): This much}

372
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:55,008
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>
{\ O (spread): Still looking good}

373
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:59,230
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread): Even though I haven't learned it yet}

374
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,452
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>
{\ O (spread): Is that okay?}

375
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Gentlemen

376
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:07,674
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>
{\ O (spread): We are}

377
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
And maybe

378
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Be quiet

379
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:11,896
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>
{\ O (spread): As a proud aristocrat}

380
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Stretch your vagina

381
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
beautifully

382
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Supple

383
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:16,118
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>
{\ O (spread): real}

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
It's always

385
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
beautifully

386
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Don't forget

387
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (rank): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

388
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Whatever happens

389
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
To be loved

390
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
As a proud aristocrat

391
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Harmful information

392
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
JoJo

393
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
nevertheless

394
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Is it sincere?

395
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Use of oneself

396
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>
{\ O (rank): graceful}

397
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:37,870
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>
{\ O (spread): ironware}

398
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,245
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The perfect supporter}

399
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,620
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread): Put away the girl's dishes}

400
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,995
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>
{\ O (spread): It's okay to eat}

401
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:43,370
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>
{\ O (spread): No meals}

402
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,745
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>
{\ O (spread): Use}

403
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,120
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>}

404
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:56,872
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>
{\ O (spread): I}

405
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:02,248
But...
{\ O (spread): Embarrassing}

406
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Such

407
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
My mother prepared it for me.

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I always tried to correct my preaching.

409
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:07,624
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.
{\ O (spread): You}

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You see, we are nobles of high birth.

411
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:13,000
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (spread): I was spoiled}

412
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>
{\ O (rank): Always question philosophy and truth in your mind}

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.
{\ O (gap): There are two knights in English folklore.}

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.
{\ O (rank): One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ O (rank): The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

416
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,000
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (spread): “If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”}

417
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here is my question for you:
{\ O (gap): Here's the problem for both of you}

418
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (gap): yes}

419
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ O (rank): Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

420
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread): What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?}

421
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank): Or is it the star shining above?}

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ O (rank): Which do you think?}

423
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:19,666
The stars?
{\ O (spread): Stars or Mud?}

424
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:20,499
Or the mud?
{\ O (spread): I think...}

425
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:21,332
I...
{\ O (spread): Why do you think so?}

426
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:22,165
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (spread): In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.}

427
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:22,998
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread): You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.}

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (gap): So no matter how many plans I had, I felt I had to live and do something.}

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (rank): I think I was looking at the stars}

430
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,000
So what?
{\ O (spread): They held onto their honour!}

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!
{\ O (gap): So}

432
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So what!
{\ O (gap): So}

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (rank): How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

434
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (rank): In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

435
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:10,500
But they—
{\ O (spread): Such powerlessness...}

436
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:10,750
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread): What they saw was the mud!}

437
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:17,392
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (spread): Such regret...}

438
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:20,713
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread): They were proud to the end, they were looking at the stars}

439
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:24,034
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (spread): I think it teaches us how to live our lives.}

440
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:27,355
Listen!
{\ O (spread): You are an aristocrat, you have what you have, you live by taking it.}

441
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:30,676
You’re a noble! You have it all!
{\ O (spread): So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?}

442
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:33,997
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread): I—}

443
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:40,999
That’s enough, you two.
{\ O (spread): There’s no right answer to this question.}

444
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:50,543
Bear in mind—
{\ O (spread): Is that okay?}

445
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:55,315
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread): People live in the silence of fate, so they reach out their hands}

446
00:27:55,315 --> 00:28:00,087
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread): Are you seeing stars or mud? Call both justice.}

447
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:04,859
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread): I stepped in next to him, the winner is Choma-san, Choma-san, the new champion!}

448
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:09,631
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>
{\ O (spread): Ta-da! I trained with Danny!}

449
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:14,403
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>
{\ O (spread): Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?}

450
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:19,175
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>
{\ O (spread): A new face has just asked to join our game.}

451
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:23,947
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>
{\ O (spread): His name is Dio Brando!}

452
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,127
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?
{\ O (spread): <i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>}

453
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:28,717
Yeah! Do it!
{\ O (spread): <i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>}

454
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,491
-Good!
{\ O (spread): <i>Everyone, gather around!</i>}

455
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:43,035
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>
{\ O (spread): Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.}

456
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:47,807
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>
{\ O (spread): That’s the bell!}

457
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:52,579
<i>The opening bell rings</i>
{\ O (spread): -Go, JoJo!}

458
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:57,351
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>
{\ O (spread): Beat him up!}

459
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:02,123
Oi!
{\ O (spread): What is this move!}

460
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:06,895
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I’ve never seen it before!}

461
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:40,537
Oi, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!}

462
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:57,358
That’s a hit to the face!
{\ O (spread): Our new champion!}

463
00:29:57,358 --> 00:30:14,179
He lost!
{\ O (spread): You did it, JoJo!}

464
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:31,000
Our king! Our king!
{\ O (spread): Danny would be proud!}

465
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Charger!

466
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Can't get through!

467
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Can't get through!

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Can't get through!

469
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What a wonderful opportunity!

470
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!
{\ O (rank): Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Darstand!}

471
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Guys, guys, guys!
{\ O (spread): My eye!}

472
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think my finger went in his eye.
{\ O (rank): I think my finger got in his eye.}

473
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:51,666
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!
{\ O (spread): I lost because of a foul.}

474
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,499
-Hey, hey!
{\ O (spread): I'm sorry I'm late today}

475
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:59,332
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?
{\ O (spread): Dio was amazing!}

476
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It hurts

477
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:03,165
Teach me!
{\ O (spread): How do you do that move?}

478
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:06,998
Guys! Ow...
{\ O (spread): everyone}

479
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Danny...
{\ O (rank): Danny}

480
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?
{\ O (rank): For some reason, Dio is trying to trap me.}

481
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It feels like he’s invading my life.
{\ O (rank): I feel like I'm being invaded more and more}

482
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>
{\ O (rank): Hey Danny, my heart hurts}

483
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>
{\ O (gap): I'm full of anxiety}

484
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>
{\ O (rank): If I were to die like this}

485
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>
{\ O (gap): Will everyone cry?}

486
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>
{\ O (rank): You're always warm}

487
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>
{\ O (rank): Thank you for being by my side}

488
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>
{\ O (rank): If I had a mother, would it be like this?}

489
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>
{\ O (gap): Is this how you loved me?}

490
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You’re...
{\ O (gap): You're a little}

491
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My hanky...
{\ O (rank): My handkerchief}

492
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!
{\ O (rank): Hey, thanks for the handkerchief}

493
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,
{\ O (rank): I'll be here in the morning too}

494
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So stop by again!
{\ O (gap): If you'd like, come too.}

495
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Danny!
{\ O (rank): Danny}

496
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Has it caught your fancy?
{\ O (gap): Are you curious?}

497
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.
{\ O (rank): Sorry for touching you without permission.}

498
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,000
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.
{\ O (spread): It’s alright.}

499
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Mexico...
{\ O (rank): Mexico}

500
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,000
Mm-hmm.
{\ O (spread): We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.}

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.
{\ O (rank): On the way back, he had a carriage accident.}

502
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.
{\ O (rank): It was when your father helped me.}

503
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you interested in it?
{\ O (rank): Are you interested?}

504
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Uh...
{\ O (spread): Oh, no. Not especially.}

505
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?
{\ O (rank): Jojo always goes out with Danny.}

506
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.
{\ O (gap): Danny has a friendship and trust for Jojo.}

507
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Friendship? With a dog?
{\ O (gap): Do you have a friend dog?}

508
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.
{\ O (rank): I bought Danny when Jojo was little.}

509
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,
{\ O (rank): At first, I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.}

510
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.
{\ O (rank): It didn't work out with Jojo either.}

511
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.
{\ O (rank): But one time Jojo drowned in the river.}

512
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:30,666
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.
{\ O (spread): There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.}

513
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:35,999
It was Danny!
{\ O (spread): Just when JoJo was about to drown...}

514
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.
{\ O (rank): Danny jumped into the river and saved Jojo's life.}

515
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.
{\ O (gap): Danny's courageous actions, knowing what life is}

516
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,600
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.
{\ O (gap): They are best friends.}

518
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
Is that so?
{\ O (rank): is that so}

519
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
M’lord.
{\ O (gap): Husband}

520
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Eh? Ah, that’s right.
{\ O (rank): Ah, that's right.}

521
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Friends...
{\ O (gap): 親友}

522
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,440

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400

Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.
{\ O (rank): That wonderful curiosity led Jojo to action.}

527
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,560
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.
{\ O (gap): Immediately the two}

528
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I fell in love

529
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Danny!
{\ O (rank): Danny}

530
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Come boy!
{\ O (rank): Come on over}

531
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.
{\ O (gap): You're so smart}

532
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,280
You have to separate the core properly before eating it.

533
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?
{\ O (rank): Hey Jo John, what have you been digging up lately?}

534
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Huh? It’s nothing.
{\ O (rank): No, nothing.}

535
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,280
What are you hiding?
{\ O (gap): Why hide it?}

536
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
It’s nothing interesting.
{\ O (gap): It's so boring}

537
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!
{\ O (rank): If you say so, I really want to see it}

538
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
You’ll just laugh!
{\ O (gap): People will laugh}

539
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I won’t laugh.
{\ O (rank): I won't laugh}

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
You’ll tell people!
{\ O (rank): I'll tell someone}

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
I won’t tell, so show me!

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,880
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,680
To that sound

549
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,880
I'm falling in love

550
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh!

<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

let’s make it our reason!</i>
{\ O (spread): This is ticklish}

So give me a reason

579
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
People who get excited

581
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,800
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>
{\ O (spread): This little courage}

582

00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,280
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>
{\ O (spread): Trembling Heart}

585
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
It’s already this late!
{\ O (rank): It's already this late}

586
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,280
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.
{\ O (gap): Because a customer is coming today}

587
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I need to hurry back.

588
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Erina!
{\ O (rank): Elna}

589
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I’ll see you tomorrow!
{\ O (rank): see you tomorrow}

590
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,136
Yes, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Joe John}

591
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:36,564
Danny!
{\ O (spread): Strongly attracted}

592
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,992
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>
{\ O (spread): What do you...}

593
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,420
Hey!
{\ O (spread): <i>Jonathan Joestar</i>}

594
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,848
I heard you were hanging
out with JoJo today.
{\ O (spread): You’re Erina Pendleton, right?}

595
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
It's Erina Pendleton

596
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Today is

597
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Apparently he and Jojo were playing together

598
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
that

599
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:45,280
He...
{\ O (spread): Umm...}

600
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280

601
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
ray

602
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
He did it!
{\ O (rank): I did it}

603
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Do it calmly

604
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,760
He does the things we’re too chicken
to, and with such confidence too!
{\ O (spread): As expected of Dion}

605
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm numb there

606
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Admire

607
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
I’ve got goosebumps!
I want to be just like him!
{\ O (spread): What we can't do}

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

609
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You haven’t, have you?
{\ O (gap): Not yet}

610
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...
{\ O (rank): My first partner wasn't JoJo.}

611
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That’s our Dio!
{\ O (rank): This is Dio}

612
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:17,332
It was me, Dio!
{\ O (spread): What does it mean if you're a lady?}

613
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,498
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?
{\ O (spread): You understand, right?}

614
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:21,664
Hey!
{\ O (spread): This guy}

615
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:23,830
She’s—!
{\ O (spread): This woman}

616
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,996
You bitch!
{\ O (spread): What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!}

617
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:42,664
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Dio...</i>}

618
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:50,998
Get up, bitch!
{\ O (spread): What’re you sleeping for?}

619
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!
{\ O (gap): Why did they give me alcohol?}

620
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!
{\ O (rank): Who do you think is helping you eat?}

621
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
This idiot

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hey, now go buy some booze!
{\ O (rank): Now buy me some alcohol}

623
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:02,666
Father, mother’s clearly not well!
{\ O (spread): Mom and Dad are a little unwell}

624
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:02,999
She’s just fakin’ it!
{\ O (spread): Are you talking back?!}

625
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:03,332
Mum! Mum!
{\ O (spread): <i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>}

626
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:03,665
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!
{\ O (spread): Dad, stop it.}

627
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:03,998
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!
{\ O (spread): Mom}

628
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:04,331
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.
{\ O (spread): I’m sorry! Please forgive me!}

629
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:04,664
Please, you’ve got to get well!
{\ O (spread): It's food, I can't take it anymore}

630
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:04,997
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): I was abandoned by the moon}

631
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:05,330
-Mum! Mum!
{\ O (spread): I'm a useless guy}

632
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:05,663
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!
{\ O (spread): If push comes to shove, I'll need you to work too.}

633
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:05,996
But our money’s already—
{\ O (spread): Wake up}

634
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm counting on you

635
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
-Stop it, Father!
{\ O (rank): Stop it}

636
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oi, you hear me?
{\ O (rank): Can you hear me?}

637
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
My voice

638
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>
{\ O (rank): A voice calling you}

639
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I already have money

640
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:57,000
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?
{\ O (spread): You buy the alcohol}

641
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000

642
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Will you rebel?

643
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You can make this much money too

644
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!
{\ O (rank): At least save up money to buy medicine.}

645
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,856
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?
{\ O (spread): There's a lot of flesh and blood}

646
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,284
Father!
{\ O (spread): How proud do you think I am to work?}

647
00:42:07,284 --> 00:42:09,712
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!
{\ O (spread): This stupid}

648
00:42:09,712 --> 00:42:12,140
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!
{\ O (spread): This guy is making fun of everyone, really.}

649
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,568
After all the trouble I went
through to nick that noble’s shit!
{\ O (spread): With the money I had taken from that nobleman}

650
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,996
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.
{\ O (spread): Yes, he's good at it.}

651
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Why don’t I send him a letter...
{\ O (rank): I need to write a letter.}

652
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,000
No...
{\ O (spread): You and I are different!}

How could you hurt her like that!</i>
{\ O (spread): Why?}

00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:38,332
<i>What in the world have I ever done
to you?! Can you tell me, Dio?</i>
{\ O (spread): Why is this happening?}

659
00:42:38,332 --> 00:42:41,665
I admired you!
{\ O (spread): Hurt her}

660
00:42:41,665 --> 00:42:44,998
<i>But now there is a single
flame that burns in my heart</i>
{\ O (spread): Who am I?}

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Why?

<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>
{\ O (spread): I respect that.}

667
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,600
<i>DIO: A little too lightly?
JOJO: I’ll never forgive you!</i>
{\ O (spread): But in my heart}

668
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,800
<i>So you’ve heard? What I
did to your beloved Erina?</i>
{\ O (spread): One thing is for sure}

669
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,000
-You’ve disgraced her!
{\ O (spread): There is something burning}

670
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,200
DIO: I bet you’re mad with jealousy!
<i>JOJO: This is for her sake, not mine!</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio}

671
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
About me etc.

672
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I don't care

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,400
<i>I have to stand up to him, even
if I can’t beat him. I cannot lose!</i>

<i>Control your emotions, you’re
different from that drunken lout</i>
{\ O (spread): I won't forgive you}

<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>
{\ O (spread): I heard that}

676
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Stand up to it

677
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Even if we can't beat each other

To someone who seems to win

00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
This me

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
This Dio

What on earth is going on?!
{\ O (rank): What on earth is going on?}

I feel so miserable!
{\ O (spread): Your stupid kiss worked better than expected!}

I’ve never felt pain like this before...
{\ O (spread): …}

718
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
How miserable and painful,

719
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This is the first time I've ever felt this way!

720
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Erina!

Erina! Did you say goodbye
to all your friends?
{\ O (rank): Have you said goodbye to all your friends?}

Yes, Father.
{\ O (rank): Yes, Dad.}

724
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I’m sorry for imposing my career
on you. Even though I know you—
{\ O (gap): I'm sorry, but it's due to my work schedule.}

725
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
With all due respect...

Let’s go.
{\ O (rank): Let's go.}

727
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I’ll make friends over there too.
{\ O (rank): You'll make friends over there too.}

728
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:13,000
I underestimated JoJo.
{\ O (spread): I gradually began to look down on them.}

729
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
His explosive power...
{\ O (rank): His explosive power,}

730

His resilience...
{\ O (gap): That mental strength.}

731
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I have to become stronger...
{\ O (gap): If we don't grow more,}

732
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!
{\ O (gap): So that we can be proud of our sincerity,}

733

{\ O (rank): Especially D.O., you did really well.}

870
00:57:12,833 --> 00:57:16,166
I was born poor...
{\ O (spread): You’ve worked so very hard.}

871
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,499
But you gave me a chance.
{\ O (spread): Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.}

872
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Thank you.
{\ O (rank): thank you}

873
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
So, I'll leave it at that.

874
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.
{\ O (rank): Thank you for always coming, Inspector.}

875
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,500
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.
{\ O (gap): With the appearance of Jack the Ripper, the world has become a dangerous place.}

876
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,500
But this is Liverpool!
{\ O (rank): No, this is Liverpool.}

877
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:42,500
There are people everywhere who lack the sense of right and wrong like him.

878
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Well then, I’ll be off.
{\ O (rank): Well then, excuse me.}

879
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:59,500
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.
{\ O (spread): …}

880
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Now, if you’ll pardon me.
{\ O (spread): It responds only to blood and operates with a precise mechanism.}

881
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:13,500
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...
{\ O (spread): Who on earth made this...}

882
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,500
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.
{\ O (spread): And for what reason?}

883
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,500
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.
{\ O (rank): If that happens, then there must be some destiny for this stone that my mother bought.}

884
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:39,500
This is...
{\ O (spread): Dario Brando?}

885
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,900
Thank you again, Master Dio—
{\ O (spread): I'm always sorry, Dio.}

886
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,100
Oh, it’s the least I could do.
{\ O (spread): It's easy to give medicine}

887
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,300
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.
{\ O (spread): thank you}

888
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,500
“Right now... I’m sick.”
{\ O (spread): I don't want to get older}

889
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
I am currently ill

890
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
“I’ll probably die.”
{\ O (rank): You'll probably die.}

891
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,500
“My heart hurts,”
{\ O (spread): My heart hurts, my hands shake, and the stones won't stop.}

892
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,000
“My hands shake,”
{\ O (spread): <i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>}

893
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,500
“And I can’t stop coughing.”
{\ O (spread): <i>The voice calling for you?</i>}

894
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,000
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Mum died and left me alone</i>}

895
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,500
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>}

896
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>I endured no matter what</i>
{\ O (gap): I have endured}

897
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,500
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>
{\ O (rank): Yes, until that day}

898
00:59:47,866 --> 00:59:51,232
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!
{\ O (spread): He's dead, and the moon has abandoned us. Damn it.}

899
00:59:51,232 --> 00:59:54,598
I know!
{\ O (spread): Yeah, I'm gonna beat this guy up and drink now.}

900
00:59:54,598 --> 00:59:57,964
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!
{\ O (spread): The only one}

901
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:01,330
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>
{\ O (spread): I threw that thing at you and trampled on you}

902
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,696
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>
{\ O (spread): I don’t bloody need it anymore!}

903
01:00:09,848 --> 01:00:15,000
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!
{\ O (spread): <i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>}

904
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,000
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>
{\ O (gap): Can you endure it, Tia?}

905
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>
{\ O (rank): Your blood flows through my body in this hell}

906
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>
{\ O (spread): Punish this curse, take it all into your hands}

907
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>
{\ O (spread): Keep winning until the very end of humanity}

908
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>
{\ O (spread): Be prepared and take action}

909
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>
{\ O (spread): Wear a mask and become a brand, father}

910
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>
{\ O (spread): Sleep with the past in a perfect world}

911
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>
{\ O (spread): Get it}

912
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>
{\ O (spread): Tia}

913
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>
{\ O (spread): Tia}

914
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,000
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): Tia}

915
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Dio!
{\ O (spread): What happened to the medicine now?}

916
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?
{\ O (spread): What’s the matter, JoJo?}

917
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.
{\ O (rank): A letter from your father seven years ago.}

918
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:35,142
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.
{\ O (spread): The detailed document from your father's deathbed is here.}

919
01:01:35,142 --> 01:01:37,713
Huh?
{\ O (spread): Wow}

920
01:01:37,713 --> 01:01:40,284
Show me that.
{\ O (spread): Let me see it.}

921
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:42,855
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.
{\ O (spread): My father and the girl are the same}

922
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:45,426
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?
{\ O (spread): You always brought medicine to my father.}

923
01:01:45,426 --> 01:01:47,997
What is this non—
{\ O (spread): What are you saying?}

924
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Answer me!
{\ O (rank): Answer me}

925
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What on earth are
you trying to say?!
{\ O (rank): What on earth are you trying to say?}

926
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.
{\ O (gap): Let me check this medicine}

927
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
JoJo...
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

928
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,
{\ O (gap): To examine this drug}

929
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then you doubt our very friendship.
{\ O (rank): to doubt our friendship}

930
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
As a gentleman,
{\ O (gap): I swear to you in all sincerity and on the honor of your father, Mr. Brand.}

931
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
If you can swear on your father’s honour,
{\ O (spread): Dio,}

932
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.
{\ O (gap): My own innocence}

933
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I’ll never speak of this again.
{\ O (rank): I swear to my father I'll never talk about this again}

934
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Swear on it.
{\ O (rank): I swear to him}

935
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Tia

936
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
A vow

937
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
A vow

938
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
A vow

939
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I swear

941
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Swear on that guy?
{\ O (rank): I swear to you, Tia}

942
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,000
Dio,
{\ O (spread): Is there any honor in that lottery?}

943
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,500
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!
{\ O (spread): Give me the medicine back!}

944
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,000
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!
{\ O (spread): Tia}

945
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,500
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!
{\ O (spread): I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!}

946
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,000
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!
{\ O (spread): I’m convinced now...}

947
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!
{\ O (gap): We never had a friendship from the start}

948
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I’ll protect the Joestar family.
{\ O (rank): I will protect JoJo}

949
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!
{\ O (rank): It's a misunderstanding, JoJo}

950
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Just a misunderstanding...
{\ O (rank): It's a misunderstanding}

951
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Besides...
{\ O (gap): And}

952
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?
{\ O (gap): There's no evidence.}

953
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.
{\ O (gap): It's just a guess}

954
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes,
{\ O (rank): yes}

955
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.
{\ O (gap): I hated my father}

956
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...
{\ O (gap): Above all, I was suspicious}

957
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I've become selfish

958
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000

{\ O (rank): JoJo}

959
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000

JoJo

961
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is something the matter, Master Dio?
{\ O (gap): What did you do, Tia?}

962
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
No...
{\ O (rank): no}

963
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:36,666
I’m alright...

<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): I can't pull anymore}

It’s too late to turn back now.
{\ O (spread): A perfect world}

<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!
{\ O (rank): What's going on, JoJo?}

970
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Speaking out loud like that

971
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-Father!
{\ O (rank): father}

972
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I’m going to London
for two or three days.
{\ O (rank): I'm going to London for a couple of days.}

973
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.
{\ O (gap): Meanwhile, the doctors I hired}

974
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I decided to provide perfect care.

975
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Excuse me, but—
{\ O (gap): Except from them}

976
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Please don’t accept any care
or medicine from anyone else.
{\ O (rank): Please do not take this as medicine or tia.}

977
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000

We’ll do as he says.
{\ O (gap): Let me do what I want}

I don’t know what’s going on...
{\ O (rank): I don't know why}

980
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I

981
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I believe in my son

982
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Father...
{\ O (rank): father}

983
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Thank you, Father.
{\ O (rank): thank you}

With this...
{\ O (spread): Use this guy}

988
01:04:52,250 --> 01:05:00,875
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.
{\ O (spread): It was disguised as a research accident.}

JoJo...
{\ O (spread): Hey, your research will kill you}

990
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:18,125
Your own research...
{\ O (spread): The time limit is tight, so prepare yourself and take off}

991
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:26,750
Will be the death of you!
{\ O (spread): Looking up at the stars in search of a laxative}

992
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:35,375
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>}

<i>Turning my eyes to the stars

<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>

<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>
{\ O (rank): There's a reason we need to move forward}

<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>
{\ O (spread): It's finally time to choose}

I'm not going to get into the costume.

1011
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
If you tend to do that, you'll end up showing your innocence

{\ O (spread): Give the rich boy a try}

1035
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000

I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!
{\ O (spread): I even blew my belly out}

1041
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
This Speed ​​Burgon was allowed, why didn't he kick with all his might?

1042
01:08:21,782 --> 01:08:26,996
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?
{\ O (spread): The mood is also aligned}

1043

I came here for the sake of my father.
{\ O (rank): I came here for my father.}

1044

So in the moment I kicked,
{\ O (spread): I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.}

1045
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I don't want to do anything that would disappoint your father.

1046

I came here for your father.

1047

That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.

01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I came here for your father.

{\ O (spread): This happened when you were a baby.}

1151
01:15:06,475 --> 01:15:06,900
I...
{\ O (spread): This is certainly my ring,}

1152
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,500
But I never reported a theft.
{\ O (gap): But no theft report was filed.}

1153
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,200
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.
{\ O (gap): A man was arrested for trying to put a ring into the seventh}

1154
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,800
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.
{\ O (gap): The ring was given to Sir Joster when he was betrothed to his wife.}

1155
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,900
It was obvious that it was stolen!
{\ O (rank): It was clear that this was a special pairing.}

1156
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,700
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.
{\ O (rank): Yes, this is the ring I made with my wife.}

1157
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,100
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,
{\ O (gap): Did you remember your wife today?}

1158
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,200
Tears welled up in his eyes.
{\ O (rank): He had tears in his eyes.}

1159
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,500
I have caught the culprit

1160
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,000
Would you like to see for yourself?
{\ O (rank): Would you like to see me?}

1161
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,100
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.
{\ O (rank): Stealing something from a nobleman is a serious crime}

1162
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,500
He’s certain to be exiled!
{\ O (gap): The punishment for fighting is certain.}

1163
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,700
I see.
{\ O (gap): Got it}

1164
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,000
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!
{\ O (gap): Hey, hey}

1165
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,900
Don't complain, Brand.

1166
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Brando?!
{\ O (rank): brand}

1167
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,300
Oh, bollocks.
{\ O (gap): Oh no, then}

1168
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,900
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,
{\ O (rank): Dario Brando is no lifesaver or anything.}

1169
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,600
But a thief!
{\ O (rank): He's just a thief}

1170
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,200
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.
{\ O (gap): Sir Joster knew that.}

1171
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,300
He adopted Dio.

1172
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,200
Why?

1173
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,100
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.
{\ O (rank): I am moved to tears by the words and actions that followed today.}

1174
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,200
Didn't he say this to you?

1175
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,900
That I gave him this ring?
{\ O (gap): This ring was given to me}

1176
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,700
Yes, he said that. A lie!
{\ O (rank): Yes, I said}

1177
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,900
Uh, yeah

1178
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,800
It’s not a lie.
{\ O (rank): It's not a lie}

1179
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,100
This is what I gave him.
{\ O (rank): This is what I gave to him}

1180
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,500
He is innocent.
{\ O (rank): He is innocent}

1181
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,300
But it’s a memento of your wife!
{\ O (rank): It's one half of your wife.}

1182
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,400
Mr. Brando,
{\ O (rank): Brand-san}

1183
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,000
yes

1184
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,800
This is yours.
{\ O (rank): This is yours}

1185
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,100
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.
{\ O (rank): Please give this ring to me and buy something for your family.}

1186
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!
{\ O (rank): Lord Joster, why did you do that?}

1187
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>
{\ O (rank): If I were suffering in poverty}

1188
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,700
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>
{\ O (rank): I would have done the same}

1189
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:27,200
Yes, for the ones I love

1190
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:32,700
For the ones I love

1191
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,700
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>
{\ O (rank): The stars in the sky are attracted to each other}

1192
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:45,200
Soon, like a myth

1193
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,200
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>
{\ O (rank): This light will clear the darkness}

1194
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,800
Let us pray

1195
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
Thank you, sir!
{\ O (rank): thank you}

1196
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,000
You are too good-natured!
{\ O (rank): You are too kind}

1197
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,100
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!
{\ O (gap): This villain is laughing inside}

1198
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,400
That may be true,
{\ O (gap): Maybe so}

1199
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
But think about it the other way around.
{\ O (rank): But think the other way around.}

1200
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:26,800
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>
{\ O (rank): From the music of destiny, people reach out to the stars}

{\ O (rank): Let's embrace that courage, that loneliness}

1202
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:36,800
<i>That pain</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Everything is connected</i>}

<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>
{\ O (spread): I am prepared to believe in humanity.}

1205
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:12,000
I can’t see stars or nothin’!

{\ O (spread): If it falls, you can't see it, you see.}

1206
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,800
Someday it will shine

1207
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,800
That’s why...
{\ O (spread): it is}

1208
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,800
Inherited and turned into gold

1209

<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.
{\ O (rank): - I heard a strange rumor.}

1216
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
- Floscia's man,

It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.
{\ O (rank): - He reportedly broke the wall with his bare hands.}

1218
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then...
{\ O (gap): - And then the man, in the morning sun,}

1219
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.
{\ O (gap): - It won't fit.}

1220
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
- It disappeared.

1221
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...
{\ O (rank): - It's the same as 30 years ago.}

1222
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
<i>It’s a wedge driven into

{\ O (gap): - Just like back then.}

There’s a saying that goes like that.
{\ O (rank): -There's a saying that goes, "That's who he is."}

1241
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
- It will be irreversible.

1242
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000

I see you’ve returned from London—
{\ O (rank): - Did you come back from London?}

It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.
{\ O (spread): - I got the deciphering material.}

It truly hurts me.
{\ O (spread): - Too bad, Dio.}

1249
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,400
Although you might not believe me,
{\ O (spread): - Really.}

You’re honest like that.
{\ O (gap): - That's the kind of guy you are.}

Can you give me more time?

Time—

My ambition was relentless.

{\ O (spread): I've seen a lot of bad guys.}

He was born evil!
{\ O (rank): - This guy is born evil.}

I will return to my bed to rest.
{\ O (spread): Come on—}

JoJo, I understand!

Arrest me.
{\ O (spread): I want you to put handcuffs on me. We've been together for seven years.}

But, if it’s not too much to ask;
{\ O (spread): Be careful!}

I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.
{\ O (spread): Agreed.}

1288
01:25:39,406 --> 01:25:45,036
For the sake of those seven

{\ O (spread): Gradually, this is my dead mother's ring. I'll be happy if I come.}

A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!
{\ O (spread): Don't begrudge me the reason}

1320
01:27:33,635 --> 01:27:33,968
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.
{\ O (spread): Maybe being strict with you made you feel unfair.}

1321
01:27:33,968 --> 01:27:34,301
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...
{\ O (spread): Anyway}

1322
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:34,634
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.
{\ O (spread): It’s not so bad...}

1323
01:28:28,637 --> 01:29:22,640
To die...

How could this be...
{\ O (spread): Father?}

I knew I made a mistake, back then.
{\ O (rank): It was definitely a mistake back then}

Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!

Dio!
{\ O (spread): Just what's happening now}

1368
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:08,497
These monsters are
making <i>more</i> monsters?!
{\ O (spread): Jaja}

1369
01:33:08,497 --> 01:33:08,568
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!
{\ O (spread): Can you hear my voice?}

1370
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:08,639
That monster is too bloody strong!
{\ O (spread): You’re—}

1371
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:08,710
The brain!
{\ O (spread): JoJo...}

JoJo!
{\ O (spread): From the Stone Mask...}

1375
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:08,994
Weak! So weak!
{\ O (spread): From your father’s blood!}

1376
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:36,196
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!
{\ O (spread): Do monsters create monsters?}

1377
01:33:36,196 --> 01:33:49,797
Humans have limits!
{\ O (spread): Mr. Joestar!}

1378
01:33:49,797 --> 01:34:03,398
This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!
{\ O (spread): That's how it works.}

1379
01:34:03,398 --> 01:34:16,999
This fire won’t kill him.
{\ O (spread): There's nothing we can do about that monster}

1380
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
How about it?

1381
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!
{\ O (rank): It's no wonder that God has lost some unknown ability from his brain.}

1382
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So then

1383
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!
{\ O (rank): If you completely destroy the head}

1384
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Stop!
{\ O (rank): Stop it}

1385
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Look!

It’s courage!
{\ O (rank): It's stronger}

Mr. Joestar!

1392
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,400
Just a little longer, just a little longer, I'll enjoy this wonderful power.

1393
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,400
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!
{\ O (rank): I still don't know how far I can go!}

<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>
{\ O (spread): No matter how many
tricks you come up with,}

1399
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:48,000
<i>Very well, I’ll take care of you first</i>

<i>(The flash of flames,
illuminating the dark)</i>
{\ O (rank): The running flames illuminate the darkness}

Come on up, Dion! I'm here.

1406
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:12,400
Are you inviting me, JoJo? Okay, you go first.

1407
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:18,400
Shining light on the running flames

1408
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,400
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>
{\ O (rank): I will end you, your power, here}

1409
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:31,400

<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>
{\ O (gap): After you gave me your power}

<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1421
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,
{\ O (rank): This is what Joestar must be thinking}

1422
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,400
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.
{\ O (gap): The stronger the firepower, the more the monster's recovery power can't keep up.}

“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...
{\ O (gap): More, more firepower}

Oh, it’s already so late!
{\ O (spread): A continuation of that day}

1580
01:47:59,816 --> 01:48:01,732
I have to return home soon...
{\ O (spread): The two}

1581
01:48:01,732 --> 01:48:03,648
It’s not late at all!
{\ O (spread): destiny}

1582
01:48:03,648 --> 01:48:05,564
But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!
{\ O (spread): yes}

1583
01:48:05,564 --> 01:48:07,480
It’s a terrifying thought!
{\ O (spread): Meeting people is}

1584
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,396
Terrifying, is it?
{\ O (spread): Maybe it's decided by fate}

1585
01:48:09,396 --> 01:48:11,312
It is!
{\ O (spread): Speedwagon is cool}

1586
01:48:11,312 --> 01:48:13,228
Well, as a matter of fact...
{\ O (spread): Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!}

1587

You’re talking with him right now!
{\ O (spread): It's a misunderstanding!}

1588
01:48:15,144 --> 01:48:17,060
You’re out playing too late,
{\ O (spread): Wait, it's the murderer}

1589
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,976
You dirty harlot!
{\ O (spread): The method was the same woman's throat.}

Slash

1594
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That belly is a face

1595
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Ammo is the worst

1596
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
The identity of the synchronized person is completely unknown

1597
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I can't grasp the truth

1598
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I like you.
{\ O (rank): Like you}

1599
01:49:55,148 --> 01:49:55,296
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

1603

<i>Seeing stars, or seeing mud?</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>}

1604
01:49:55,684 --> 01:49:55,744
<i>We’ll change the tune of
that tired old philosophy!</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Don’t you want power?</i>}

1605
01:49:55,744 --> 01:49:55,804
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>}

1606
01:49:55,804 --> 01:49:55,864
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

1608
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:55,984
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>
{\ O (spread): Humans are bound by notions of virtue.}

1609
01:49:55,984 --> 01:49:56,044
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>
{\ O (spread): They fear that which is spectacularly evil.}

1610
01:49:56,044 --> 01:49:56,104
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>
{\ O (spread): However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.}

1611

{\an8}<i>(Blood! Flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Those are the evil elite.

<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>
{\ O (spread): How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?}

1613
01:49:56,224 --> 01:49:56,284
The Stone Mask...
{\ O (spread): What do you know about me?!}

1614
01:49:56,284 --> 01:49:56,344
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.
{\ O (spread): <i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>}

1615
01:49:56,344 --> 01:49:56,404
Yes.
{\ O (spread): <i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>}

01:49:56,404 --> 01:49:56,464
It has to have been.
{\ O (spread): <i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>}

It’s alright.
{\ O (spread): <i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>}

01:49:56,524 --> 01:49:56,584
I’m alright.
{\ O (spread): Me, afraid?!}

1619
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:56,596
Has he been here

{\ O (spread): Let’s go.}

Jonathan Joestar!
{\ O (spread): Eh?}

1621
01:49:56,602 --> 01:49:56,608
And Miss Erina Pendleton.
{\ O (spread): What’s wrong?}

1622
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:56,614
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!
{\ O (spread): <i>I’ll give you pleasure greater

{\ O (spread): Jack, no more worries, more pleasure in your hands}

{\ O (spread): I have no fear}

1629
01:49:56,650 --> 01:49:56,656

It doesn’t hurt anymore!
{\ O (spread): Bad Earth, how many times have I been zeroed out?}

How do you know my name!
{\ O (spread): I'm living my life, the sun is already gone}

1635

<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>
{\ O (spread): Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death}

01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,000
This world

1637
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
The Stone Mask?!
{\ O (rank): That stone gana}

1638
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:36,500
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>
{\ O (spread): I want to believe that, like the others, I have become a powder keg.}

<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>
{\ O (spread): I think so, yes}

01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
What will happen now?
{\ O (rank): what happened?}

{\ O (spread): Ishikamen's Power}

1672
01:54:49,667 --> 01:54:49,690
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.
{\ O (spread): I'm on your side}

1673
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:49,713
This is made possible by the rhythm

To fight... That is my destiny!
{\ O (spread): Special endorsement}

1693
01:56:08,073 --> 01:56:12,196
Mine and Dio’s!
{\ O (spread): The blood carries}

1694
01:56:12,196 --> 01:56:16,319
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,
{\ O (spread): The body burns the bifnech}

1695
01:56:16,319 --> 01:56:20,442
That turns humans into vampires.
{\ O (spread): Energy is generated}

1696
01:56:20,442 --> 01:56:24,565
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.
{\ O (spread): The name is}

However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.
{\ O (spread): And that wave of energy}

1698
01:56:29,437 --> 01:56:30,186
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!
{\ O (spread): It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.}

1699
01:56:30,186 --> 01:56:30,935
You see?
{\ O (spread): Ah, let’s put it this way.}

1700
01:56:30,935 --> 01:56:31,684
We’re already out of time.
{\ O (spread): What must you do to stop that ripple?}

1701
01:56:31,684 --> 01:56:32,433
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!
{\ O (spread): I think I’ve got it!}

1702
01:56:32,433 --> 01:56:33,182
JoJo?
{\ O (spread): Use a ripple!}

1703
01:56:33,182 --> 01:56:33,931
Erina...
{\ O (spread): If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!}

1704
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:34,680
I can’t get you involved in this!
{\ O (spread): It gives you just a little bit of energy}

For now, please just go along with it!

Collected from the whole body

1709
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,360
What makes this possible is

01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,720
It's a rhythm of breathing.

1711
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,000
Breathing is the power of now

1712
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
The power to defeat Dio!
{\ O (rank): Yes, the power of breathing}

This breath, both inside and out

1715
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
About the Stone Mask

1716
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
And about you and Dio

1717
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Dio

1718
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
The mask can only be worn by those who haven't changed.

1719
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Rio the Stone Masked Man

1720
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I still walk in the darkness

1721
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I travel the world

1722
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I followed the mask

1723
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
To destroy

1724
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Dio is alive

1725
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
If we don't fight

1726
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
If you don't destroy it

1727
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Jamon in your hand

1728
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Otherwise

1729
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
You and the world

1730
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
<i>(In, out!)</i>
{\ O (rank): Fate is in motion}

1731
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I finally found it

1732
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Do you accept it?

1733
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
This fate

1734
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Everything is lifted up

1735
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
That's it

1736
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
supermarket

1737
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
supermarket

1738
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
supermarket

1739
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
destiny

1740
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
fight

1741
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
That's my destiny

1742
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Me and Dio

1743
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
The individual body of the Stone Mask

1744
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Unlocking the unknown power of your brain

1745
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Turning humans into vampires

1746
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
it is

1747
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You must take blood energy from others.

1748
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
On the other hand, Hamon's power

1749
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
From your own bloodstream

1750
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
To draw out energy

1751
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Front and back

1752
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Same energy

1753
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Yeah

1754
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
In other words

1755
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
To remove this jamon

1756
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
What do you mean, Dio?
{\ O (rank): What do you think I should do?}

1757
01:59:55,173 --> 01:59:56,346
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>
{\ O (spread): I'm starting to understand}

1758
01:59:56,346 --> 01:59:57,519
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>
{\ O (spread): Hamon. Hit them with another kind of hamon and they'll shatter.}

1759
01:59:57,519 --> 01:59:58,692
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>
{\ O (spread): And these energy waves have the same shape as sunlight.}

1760
01:59:58,692 --> 01:59:59,865
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>
{\ O (spread): The power to defeat Dio.}

1761
01:59:59,865 --> 02:00:01,038
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>
{\ O (spread): Yes. Time is running out. Learn how to turn courage into strength.}

1762
02:00:01,038 --> 02:00:02,211
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>
{\ O (spread): JoJo!}

1763
02:00:02,211 --> 02:00:03,384
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>
{\ O (spread): Eina, I can't get you involved.}

1764
02:00:03,384 --> 02:00:04,557
<i>I am left behind</i>
{\ O (spread): I just want you to nod now.}

1765
02:00:04,557 --> 02:00:05,730
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>
{\ O (spread): I'll definitely come back to this place.}

1766
02:00:05,730 --> 02:00:06,903
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>
{\ O (spread): Is this the Hamon from JoJo?}

1767
02:00:06,903 --> 02:00:08,076
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>
{\ O (spread): …}

1768
02:00:08,076 --> 02:00:09,249
<i>I want to scream!</i>
{\ O (spread): The clouds flow, the wind leaves thoughts behind}

1769
02:00:09,249 --> 02:00:10,422
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>
{\ O (spread): go around}

1770
02:00:10,422 --> 02:00:11,595
<i>You are drawn to me</i>
{\ O (spread): I nodded.}

1771
02:00:11,595 --> 02:00:12,768
<i>Forever guided by fate</i>
{\ O (spread): To your resolve}

1772
02:00:12,768 --> 02:00:13,941
<i>I’ll live my days, spinning its thread</i>
{\ O (spread): In sadness}

1773
02:00:13,941 --> 02:00:15,114
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Stars are drawn together</i>}

1774
02:00:15,114 --> 02:00:16,287
<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>}

1775
02:00:16,287 --> 02:00:17,460
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>
{\ O (spread): Caught in the mud}

1776
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:18,633
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Waiting right here</i>}

1777
02:00:25,994 --> 02:00:33,355
<i>Our stars shine together</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>So that I can call this
destiny one of love</i>}

1778
02:00:33,355 --> 02:00:40,716
<i>No matter where you are, I will, I will,</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>}

1779
02:00:40,716 --> 02:00:48,077
<i>I will live on!</i>
{\ O (spread): For whom is loneliness}

1780
02:00:48,077 --> 02:00:55,438
<i>I will live on!</i>
{\ O (spread): Even if it doesn't reach}

1781
02:00:55,438 --> 02:01:02,799
<i>I will live on!</i>
{\ O (spread): Even if you're not attracted to me now}

1782
02:01:02,799 --> 02:01:10,160
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!
{\ O (spread): I want to scream}

1783
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:17,521
Yep!
{\ O (spread): To be me}

1784
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:24,882
C’mere!
{\ O (spread): You are attracted to each other}

1785
02:01:24,882 --> 02:01:32,243
Why are you so strong?!
{\ O (spread): Always guided by fate}

1786
02:01:32,243 --> 02:01:39,604
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!
{\ O (spread): I weave the days together}

1787
02:01:39,604 --> 02:01:46,965
Speeeedwagon!
{\ O (spread): Let's live}

1788
02:01:46,965 --> 02:01:54,326
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!
{\ O (spread): Looking up at the stars}

1789
02:01:54,326 --> 02:02:01,687
JOJO: Stop right there!
{\ O (spread): To this place}

1790
02:02:01,687 --> 02:02:09,048
Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread): You'll tell me someday}

1791
02:02:09,048 --> 02:02:16,409
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!
{\ O (spread): Stay proud}

1792
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:23,770
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!
{\ O (spread): Accepting all of you}

1793
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:31,131
Licky licky? Licky licky!
{\ O (spread): Destiny and Love}

1794
02:02:31,131 --> 02:02:38,492
Licky licky! Licky licky!
{\ O (spread): So that we can call it that}

1795
02:02:38,492 --> 02:02:45,853
Lickithan Joestar.
{\ O (spread): The stars are attracted to each other}

1796
02:02:45,853 --> 02:02:53,214
JoJo, be careful.
{\ O (spread): Guided by the destiny I love}

1797
02:02:53,214 --> 02:03:00,575
He’s strong enough to rival you.
{\ O (spread): The stars are attracted to each other}

1798
02:03:00,575 --> 02:03:07,936
What was that, you old fart?
{\ O (spread): Wherever you are}

1799
02:03:07,936 --> 02:03:15,297
<i>Old fart?</i>
{\ O (spread): I am me}

1800
02:03:15,297 --> 02:03:22,658
Time for a taste!
{\ O (spread): Live on}

1801
02:03:22,658 --> 02:03:30,019
His arm... got longer!
{\ O (spread): Live on}

1802
02:03:30,019 --> 02:03:37,380
It’s useless.
{\ O (spread): Live on}

1803
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:44,741
I’ve been given new life!
{\ O (spread): Wang Chen, you're still alive?}

1804
02:03:44,741 --> 02:03:52,102
And a body that transcends humanit—
{\ O (spread): yes}

1805
02:03:52,102 --> 02:03:59,463
That’s not what’s important here.
{\ O (spread): Ugh ugh ugh!}

1806
02:03:59,463 --> 02:04:06,824
M-My body...
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1807
02:04:06,824 --> 02:04:14,185
It’s hot!
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1808
02:04:14,185 --> 02:04:21,546
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1809
02:04:21,546 --> 02:04:28,907
Ah! Wait!
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1810
02:04:28,907 --> 02:04:36,268
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.
{\ O (spread): Ugh ugh ugh!}

1811
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:43,629
What’s wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread): Hahaha!}

1812
02:04:43,629 --> 02:04:50,990
I lost so much...
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1813
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:58,351
That’s why I wanted power.
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1814
02:04:58,351 --> 02:05:05,712
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1815
02:05:05,712 --> 02:05:13,073
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!
{\ O (spread): Ah!}

1816
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:11,600
Ah!

1817
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,100
Ah!

1818
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:12,600
Haha!

1819
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,100
Ha!

1820
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,500
But it’s the same power!
{\ O (rank): What is that power?}

1821
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,000
Haha!

1822
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
No way, that Dio guy

1823
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
SPEEEEEEEE!

1824
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,500
Wagum!

1825
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,300
You are,

1826
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,600
I know too much about the Stone Mask's secrets.

1827
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,600
It’s amazing!
{\ O (rank): It's Agarmaru!}

1828
02:05:31,645 --> 02:05:32,690
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:
{\ O (spread): Mr. Joestar!}

1829
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:33,735
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”
{\ O (spread): You were looking too!}

1830
02:05:33,735 --> 02:05:34,780
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,
{\ O (spread): Because, because! Dio-sama said so!}

1831
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:35,825
They became vikings with backbone!
{\ O (spread): I can lick your blood!}

1832
02:05:35,825 --> 02:05:36,870
You are different from Dio and his ilk!
{\ O (spread): Lick? Lick? Lick? Lick! Lick! Lick!}

1833
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:37,915
Because you feel the pain.
{\ O (spread): Bello-san Joestar?}

1834
02:05:37,915 --> 02:05:38,960
Pain...
{\ O (spread): Be careful JoJo, he's got some serious power.}

1835
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:40,005
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>
{\ O (spread): What was that?!}

1836
02:05:45,414 --> 02:05:50,823
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>}

1837
02:05:50,823 --> 02:05:56,232
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>}

1838
02:05:56,232 --> 02:06:01,641
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>}

1839
02:06:01,641 --> 02:06:07,050
<i>The mask burst with light</i>
{\ O (spread): You need to listen to that pain!}

1840
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:12,459
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>}

1841
02:06:12,459 --> 02:06:17,868
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread): <i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>}

1842
02:06:17,868 --> 02:06:23,277
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>}

1843
02:06:23,277 --> 02:06:28,686
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>}

1844
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:27,760
My arm...

1845
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:30,760
me

1846
02:06:28,686 --> 02:06:34,095
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>}

1847
02:06:34,095 --> 02:06:39,504
It was my father!
{\ O (spread): <i>Staining the darkness red</i>}

1848
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:40,400
It was

1849
02:06:39,504 --> 02:06:44,913
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>}

1850
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,340
I got a new life

1851
02:06:44,913 --> 02:06:50,322
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>
{\ O (spread): It was pure coincidence!}

1852
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:49,880
Creating something that surpasses humanity

1853
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:57,540
If it's important, it's not here

1854
02:06:50,322 --> 02:06:55,731
<i>ZEP: I’ve been chasing after it
JOJO: So that it won’t repeat</i>
{\ O (spread): I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!}

1855
02:06:55,731 --> 02:07:01,140
<i>ZEP: I swore to take revenge
JOJO: I won’t let you down!</i>
{\ O (spread): My arm...}

1856
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,960
Or your body!

1857
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,940
It's hot! What's this?

1858
02:07:01,140 --> 02:07:06,549
<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be
JOJO: Shining bright</i>
{\ O (spread): My arm...}

1859
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:05,020
It's hot! It's hot!

1860
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh! Wait a minute!

1861
02:07:06,549 --> 02:07:11,958
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>
{\ O (spread): My arm...}

1862
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:13,260
Amazing, JoJo

1863
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:17,367
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!
{\ O (spread): My arm...}

1864
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:17,380
You've mastered Hamon in such a short time.

1865
02:07:17,367 --> 02:07:22,776
And the resolve to face the consequences.
{\ O (spread): My arm...}

1866
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:21,820
what up?

1867
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,420
JoJo!
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

1868
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:27,020
I lost my treasury

1869
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,340
So I wanted power

1870
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:32,860
But that

1871
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,540
Not the same as Dio

1872
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,620
To hurt someone

1873
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,420
It is fundamentally different from the power that is obtained by stealing.

1874
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,180
But it's the same power!

1875
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:46,980
There is a proverb in the northern country of Norway:

1876
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:50,860
The North Wind created the brave Viking

1877
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:54,100
A harsh north wind blows

1878
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,700
Because I know the pain

1879
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,740
A Viking with timber frame was born

1880
02:07:58,820 --> 02:07:59,820
Not like them

1881
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,420
You

1882
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,460
I know the pain

1883
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,020
pain

1884
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:12,900
The pain of losing a friend

1885
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:16,940
The pain of inheriting pride

1886
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:22,340
The pain of the person you want to protect

1887
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:24,700
Proof of Life

1888
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,220
<i>We embrace this pain</i>
{\ O (rank): Listen to the pain}

1889
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:35,100
I was always told to be sincere.

1890
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:41,820
Always following my father's lead

1891
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:51,540
I still don't know if it's true sincerity

1892
02:08:52,540 --> 02:09:01,660
The Joestar's blood is hot and trembling

1893
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:08,660
The daily routine surface is dyed in a glowing red darkness

1894
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:13,100
That tragedy repeats itself

1895
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:16,900
<i>We embrace this pain</i>
{\ O (rank): Holding this pain}

1896
02:09:18,637 --> 02:09:20,374
Hey JoJo.
{\ O (spread): Is it a matter of daily routine?}

1897
02:09:20,374 --> 02:09:22,111
JoJo JoJo JoJo.
{\ O (spread): It was something I discovered by chance.}

1898
02:09:22,111 --> 02:09:23,848
Ha-hey JoJo.
{\ O (spread): What?}

1899
02:09:23,848 --> 02:09:25,585
Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.
{\ O (spread): A wedge driven into the wilderness of memory}

1900
02:09:25,585 --> 02:09:27,322
Don’t forget this goal.
{\ O (spread): Once upon a time, I crossed the seven seas with my father}

1901
02:09:27,322 --> 02:09:29,059
Yes, sir.
{\ O (spread): Quiet Shore Night}

1902
02:09:29,059 --> 02:09:30,796
I believe in the power of the ripple.
{\ O (spread): That mask emits light}

1903
02:09:30,796 --> 02:09:32,533
Yep.
{\ O (spread): 58 of his comrades were killed.}

1904
02:09:32,533 --> 02:09:34,270
I like your fringe.
{\ O (spread): Severi}

1905
02:09:34,270 --> 02:09:36,007
Hey JoJo, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): A masked man comes}

1906
02:09:36,007 --> 02:09:37,744
Why, why?!
{\ O (spread): It's the same as back then}

1907
02:09:37,744 --> 02:09:39,481
Jonathan Joestar!
{\ O (spread): At this time, the morning sun of salvation shone}

1908
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:41,218
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?
{\ O (spread): It was my father}

1909
02:09:41,218 --> 02:09:42,955
Are you angry?
{\ O (spread): Illuminated by the red morning sun, my father disappeared}

1910
02:09:42,955 --> 02:09:44,692
You’re good company, huh?
{\ O (spread): My watch stopped then}

1911
02:09:44,692 --> 02:09:46,429
Oh! It burns! It burns!
{\ O (spread): Holding this pain}

1912
02:09:46,429 --> 02:09:48,166
My body, it—
{\ O (spread): I've been chasing}

1913
02:09:48,166 --> 02:09:49,903
Is that Mr. Horse?
{\ O (spread): Don't repeat}

1914
02:09:49,903 --> 02:09:51,640
Look Wang Chan!
Your, your ancestors—
{\ O (spread): Vow revenge}

1915
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,377
Clippity clop, clippity clop!
{\ O (spread): Don't make me sad}

1916
02:09:53,377 --> 02:09:55,114
<i>The lovable sweetheart, Mr. Joestar,
has finally got a handle on the ripple</i>
{\ O (spread): Tomorrow will shine}

1917
02:09:55,114 --> 02:09:56,851
<i>Hey yo yo! We’re coming
to collect payment</i>
{\ O (spread): With pain}

1918
02:09:56,851 --> 02:09:58,588
<i>These bills been piling piling up</i>
{\ O (spread): What is he...}

1919
02:09:58,588 --> 02:10:00,325
<i>Your underworld rep, AKA
Speedwagon, is here to give a full report</i>
{\ O (spread): The courage to own the pain}

1920
02:10:00,325 --> 02:10:02,062
<i>Who else would be your guide</i>
{\ O (spread): and}

1921
02:10:02,062 --> 02:10:03,799
<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>
{\ O (spread): Ready to shoulder the burden}

1922
02:10:03,799 --> 02:10:05,536
<i>South of London, in total daylight,</i>
{\ O (spread): JoJo!}

1923
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,747
<i>That famous city of knights</i>
{\ O (spread): yes}

1924
02:10:09,589 --> 02:10:13,642
He’s inside the horse’s body!
{\ O (spread): <i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>}

1925
02:10:10,747 --> 02:10:12,484
<i>This is Windknight’s Lot</i>
{\ O (spread): I believe in the power of this question.}

1926
02:10:12,484 --> 02:10:14,221
<i>A natural fortress like an augite rock</i>
{\ O (spread): let's go}

1927
02:10:13,642 --> 02:10:17,695
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!
{\ O (spread): <i>When we pass through this
tunnel, you’ll see the sights</i>}

1928
02:10:14,221 --> 02:10:15,958
<i>Windknight’s Lot</i>
{\ O (spread): 【applause】}

1929
02:10:15,958 --> 02:10:17,695
<i>Fate’ll have it—Dio’s hideout</i>
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

1930
02:10:17,695 --> 02:10:19,432
<i>While the sun’s out</i>
{\ O (spread): Mr. Joestar!}

1931
02:10:19,432 --> 02:10:21,169
<i>We’ll knock it out</i>
{\ O (spread): Aha}

1932
02:10:21,169 --> 02:10:22,906
<i>While the sun’s out</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio}

1933
02:10:22,906 --> 02:10:24,643
<i>Clean this vampire nest out</i>
{\ O (spread): One}

1934
02:10:24,643 --> 02:10:26,380
<i>Ay, Dio, dick, you make me sick</i>
{\ O (spread): There he is.}

1935
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:28,117
<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>
{\ O (spread): Ah, here it comes.}

1936
02:10:28,117 --> 02:10:29,854
<i>No more tomorrows Dio, that’s it</i>
{\ O (spread): Otsuchi}

1937
02:10:29,854 --> 02:10:31,591
<i>Now’s the end, ya gonna get hit!</i>
{\ O (spread): Red Asahi}

1938
02:10:31,591 --> 02:10:33,328
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.
{\ O (spread): He won't splash blood on me.}

1939
02:10:33,328 --> 02:10:35,065
My underground sources say that
Wang Chan definitely fled here.
{\ O (spread): a}

1940
02:10:35,065 --> 02:10:36,802
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.
{\ O (spread): Pacara}

1941
02:10:36,802 --> 02:10:38,539
It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.
{\ O (spread): this}

1942
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:40,276
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.
{\ O (spread): T-The horse!!}

1943
02:10:46,735 --> 02:10:53,194
Stand down, you two.
{\ O (spread): Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.}

1944
02:10:53,194 --> 02:10:59,653
I will fight!
{\ O (spread): Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?}

1945
02:10:59,653 --> 02:11:06,112
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!
{\ O (spread): Whaaat?!}

1946
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:12,571
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?
{\ O (spread): Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.}

1947
02:11:12,571 --> 02:11:19,030
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.
{\ O (spread): L-Look!}

1948
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:25,489
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?
{\ O (spread): That guy}

1949
02:11:25,489 --> 02:11:31,948
What are you yammering on about!
{\ O (spread): That guy should be Yama-chan, the researcher finally got a grip on him.}

1950
02:11:31,948 --> 02:11:38,407
So then, what exactly is “courage”?
{\ O (spread): Yeah yo yo, I'm off to pay off the accumulated debts}

1951
02:11:38,407 --> 02:11:44,866
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!
{\ O (spread): Represent the underworld AK Speed ​​is a detailed investigation by agreement}

1952
02:11:44,866 --> 02:11:51,325
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.
{\ O (spread): I'll be your guide, I'll show you the 16-bar showtime}

1953
02:11:51,325 --> 02:11:57,784
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!
{\ O (spread): From London to the south, on the round land, we drove without rest in a carriage}

1954
02:11:57,784 --> 02:12:04,243
The hymn of humanity
is a song of courage!
{\ O (spread): I can see that I can go to the Imishie Toner}

1955
02:12:04,243 --> 02:12:10,702
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!
{\ O (spread): Nara, a city on the shore}

1956
02:12:10,702 --> 02:12:17,161
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!
{\ O (spread): Windknight’s Lot...}

1957
02:12:17,161 --> 02:12:23,620
They’re just like fleas!
{\ O (spread): Wind Knight's Road The true nature of the fate is Dio's hideout}

1958
02:12:23,620 --> 02:12:30,079
Hot, so hot!
{\ O (spread): The joy of taking action while the Sun King is still around}

1959
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:36,538
Yes... I’ll eat every
shred of you in one bite!
{\ O (spread): While the Sun King is still there, clean up every month}

1960
02:12:36,538 --> 02:12:42,997
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!
{\ O (spread): Dio, you're so good at playing with your life.}

1961
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Dio, come tomorrow to you, we'll defeat the end now

1962
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Thank you Speed ​​Ago I appreciate it

1963
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
The inside information was accurate. It seems that Tranchen has escaped further ahead.

1964
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Dio will build his empire here.

1965
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
If we can find him while the sun is still out

1966
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Enter the tunnel. This is the entrance to the city.

1967
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Arrived on schedule

1968
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Hey, giant carriage, why are you stopping the carriage?

1969
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Be careful, the sun doesn't reach here

1970
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Escape from Tranchen

1971
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Look, horse, horse

1972
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
What is this thing?

1973
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
The horses also slipped in easily.

1974
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Your blood

1975
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I'll give it a taste.

1976
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Jota, you two stay back.

1977
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I will fight

1978
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
JoJo, fighting spirit.

1979
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
It's growing

1980
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
This insect is a giant human being.

1981
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I'm challenging you to a fight

1982
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Can you call that courage?

1983
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
How dare you! I’ll kill you!
{\ O (rank): What are you talking about?}

1984
02:14:51,117 --> 02:14:53,234
I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.
{\ O (spread): What exactly is courage?}

1985
02:14:53,234 --> 02:14:55,351
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.
{\ O (spread): Disturbing breathing is scary}

1986
02:14:55,351 --> 02:14:57,468
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.
{\ O (spread): If you overcome fear, your breathing will not become irregular}

1987
02:14:57,468 --> 02:14:59,585
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.
{\ O (spread): Ripple Cannon Attack}

1988
02:14:59,585 --> 02:15:01,702
Can you hear me?
{\ O (spread): Goku is a product of courage}

1989
02:15:01,702 --> 02:15:03,819
Sleeping knights...
{\ O (spread): Human production is the production of courage}

1990
02:15:03,819 --> 02:15:05,936
<i>Follow me, serve royalty once again</i>
{\ O (spread): The greatness of humanity is the greatness of courage}

1991
02:15:05,936 --> 02:15:08,053
<i>Get your revenge on the past,
let’s rewrite history</i>
{\ O (spread): No matter how strong}

1992
02:15:08,053 --> 02:15:10,170
<i>Upend righteousness,
go for total victory</i>
{\ O (spread): These zombies don't know courage}

1993
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:12,287
<i>That’s this world, the
unwavering world of Dio</i>
{\ O (spread): Drinks and dollars}

<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>
{\ O (spread): Dollars!}

1995
02:15:14,404 --> 02:15:16,521
<i>Your long silence has
left this world to rot</i>
{\ O (spread): Hot! Hot!}

1996
02:15:16,521 --> 02:15:18,638
<i>Now raise your voices,
from crushed throats</i>
{\ O (spread): desire!}

1997
02:15:18,638 --> 02:15:20,755
<i>Crying out from the mud,
conquer the stars</i>
{\ O (spread): I can definitely kill you}

1998
02:15:20,755 --> 02:15:22,872
<i>I’ll allow you this and more!</i>
{\ O (spread): surely!}

1999
02:15:22,872 --> 02:15:24,989
<i>(My sword, it’s yours!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Pieces out!}

2000
02:15:24,989 --> 02:15:27,106
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices)</i>
{\ O (spread): I'll eat it}

2001
02:15:27,106 --> 02:15:29,223
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>
{\ O (spread): Hidden passage in the tunnel}

2002
02:15:29,223 --> 02:15:31,340

us rotten and forgotten corpses)</i>
{\ O (spread): Window Light Lot}

2003
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,457
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>
{\ O (spread): This is the knights' training ground}

2004
02:15:33,457 --> 02:15:35,574
<i>Get your revenge!</i>
{\ O (spread): I hear there are a variety of tricks}

2005
02:15:35,574 --> 02:15:37,691
<i>300 years asleep, haunted
by painful thoughts</i>
{\ O (spread): And there's a huge underground cemetery.}

2007
02:15:39,808 --> 02:15:41,925

02:15:41,925 --> 02:15:44,042
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>
{\ O (spread): I'm sure Dio is up there}

Wait, Dio!
{\ O (spread): Dollars!}

{\ O (spread): Dollars!}

2013
02:15:52,510 --> 02:15:54,627
My world is in the palm of my hand now!
{\ O (spread): Answer me}

2014
02:15:54,627 --> 02:15:56,744
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It’s really melting away...}

2015
02:15:57,802 --> 02:15:58,860
So much that there’s a hole in my cheek...
{\ O (spread): <i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>}

2016
02:15:58,860 --> 02:15:59,918
My tongue is sticking out of the hole!
{\ O (spread): <i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>}

2017
02:15:59,918 --> 02:16:00,976
Your cheek is melting,
{\ O (spread): <i>I will dominate life at last,</i>}

2018
02:16:00,976 --> 02:16:02,034
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?
{\ O (spread): <i>Tearing its natural
order from God’s grasp</i>}

2019
02:16:02,034 --> 02:16:03,092
Dio!
{\ O (spread): <i>I will dominate history too,</i>}

2020
02:16:07,329 --> 02:16:09,446
<i>Rewriting and upending it anew</i>
{\ O (spread): Unwavering}

2021
02:16:09,446 --> 02:16:11,563
<i>I will dominate even time,</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>This is Dio’s World!</i>}

2022
02:16:11,563 --> 02:16:13,680
<i>My body eternal and sublime</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>My world, this world!</i>}

2023
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:15,797
{\an8}<i>(Eternal life!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The long silence}

2024
02:16:15,797 --> 02:16:17,914
<i>I will dominate everything,
rise above all my cares</i>
{\ O (spread): It has corrupted this country}

2025
02:16:17,914 --> 02:16:20,031
{\an8}<i>(We vow to steal them away!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Now is the time to speak up}

2026
02:16:20,031 --> 02:16:22,148
<i>Win it all, negate righteousness</i>
{\ O (spread): My throat has been blown}

2027
02:16:22,148 --> 02:16:24,265
<i>In this peacefully unaware country</i>
{\ O (spread): Scream from the mud}

2028
02:16:24,265 --> 02:16:26,382
{\an8}<i>(This country is ours!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Drop that star}

2029
02:16:26,382 --> 02:16:28,499
<i>And demand peace of mind!</i>
{\ O (spread): Let's allow that}

2030
02:16:28,499 --> 02:16:30,616
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Mytion!}

2031
02:16:30,616 --> 02:16:32,733
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Easy jewel!}

2032
02:16:32,733 --> 02:16:34,850
<i>Wry wry!</i>
{\ O (spread): Raise this voice}

2033
02:16:34,850 --> 02:16:36,967
It’s melting...
{\ O (spread): Rot in 300 years}

2034
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Let it go behind you

2035
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Return in 300 years

2036
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
This one second

2037
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Wait, Dio

2038
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Come quickly, JoJo

2039
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I am

2040
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I got my world

2041
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Dollars!

2042
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Kill them all

2043
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Dollars!

2044
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Destroy it all

2045
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Even life is controlled

2046
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Breaking God's Word

2047
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Controlling history

2048
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
<i>I will dominate everything,
I’ll face them now</i>
{\ O (rank): I'll learn everything anew}

2049
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:27,800
The sun has set.
{\ O (spread): Controlling Time}

2050
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:28,700
It’s time for your lives
to go down with it!
{\ O (spread): Beyond Eternity}

2051
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,600
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!
{\ O (spread): Heavenly Command}

2052
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:30,500
Even so, I can’t help
this feeling of dread.
{\ O (spread): Rule them all}

2053
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:31,400
As a human, I can’t let
you get away with this!
{\ O (spread): It's been a while}

2054
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:32,300
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Live to the fullest}

2055
02:18:32,300 --> 02:18:33,200
Put your training to use.
{\ O (spread): Acknowledge all}

2056
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:34,100
<i>(We’ll feast! On your blood and flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Justice is justice}

2057
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:35,000
<i>(Steal it away!)</i>
{\ O (spread): A country of justice and ulterior motives}

2058
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:35,900
<i>(To heal all of our wounds!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Beyond Eternity}

2059
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:36,800
<i>JoJo, here’s a lesson for you</i>
{\ O (spread): Rule them all}

2060
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:37,700
<i>The north wind made the vikings!</i>
{\ O (spread): Song weaving}

2061
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,600
This battle will be an exercise—
{\ O (spread): Seeking kindness}

2062
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:39,500
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!
{\ O (spread): My World}

2063
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:40,400
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!
{\ O (spread): This world}

2064
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:41,300
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—
{\ O (spread): Dio Brando?}

2065
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:42,200
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>
{\ O (spread): Laughter}

2066
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,100
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>
{\ O (spread): Ah, it melts}

2067
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:44,000
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The dead melt so fast}

2068
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:44,900
<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>
{\ O (spread): My cheeks melted and holes appeared}

2069
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:45,800
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>The waves of the ripple!</i>}

2070
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:46,700
<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread): There's a hole in my cheek}

2071
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,600
<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread): A tongue is sticking out of the hole}

2072
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:48,500
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>
{\ O (spread): Jack!}

2073
02:18:48,500 --> 02:18:49,400
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>
{\ O (spread): Oh, that's true.}

2074
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:50,300
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio!}

2075
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:51,200
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>
{\ O (spread): Protruding}

2076
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,100
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The fire went out}

2077
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:53,000
<i>The ripple of the wine!</i>
{\ O (spread): Your lives too}

2078
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:53,900
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It's time to sink}

2079
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:54,800
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my
way through the darkness!</i>
{\ O (spread): I've been preparing for that moment}

2080
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:55,700
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>
{\ O (spread): But it makes me feel good}

2081
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:56,600
<i>Are resounding through my body!</i>
{\ O (spread): You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.}

2082
02:18:56,600 --> 02:18:57,500
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread): You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.}

2083
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,400
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>
{\ O (spread): You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.}

2084
02:18:58,400 --> 02:18:59,300
<i>Find your way through the darkness!</i>
{\ O (spread): The north wind made the vikings!}

2085
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,100
<i>Pa-pow-pow-pow with unrelenting heat!</i>
{\ O (spread): The North Wind created the Vikings.}

2086
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,000
{\an8}<i>(Heat!)</i>
{\ O (spread): I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.}

2087
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:02,900
<i>Sunlight...</i>
{\ O (spread): I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.}

2088
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:03,800
<i>(Sunlight...)</i>
{\ O (spread): I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.}

2089
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,700
<i>Yellow...</i>
{\ O (spread): I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.}

2090
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:05,600
<i>(Yellow...)</i>
{\ O (spread): Disturbed the universe}

2091
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,500
<i>Over...</i>
{\ O (spread): A similar wind is blowing}

2092
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:07,400
<i>(Over!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Wine Harmony}

2093
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:08,300
<i>Sunlight yellow, sunlight yellow</i>
{\ O (spread): I feel it}

2094
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:09,200
<i>Overdrive!!</i>
{\ O (spread): Sing the Darkness}

2095
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,100
The ripple of the sun! Dio!
{\ O (spread): The Serpent Gate Wave}

2096
02:19:10,100 --> 02:19:11,000
This is the power
that will defeat you!
{\ O (spread): Resonate throughout your body}

2097
02:20:34,250 --> 02:22:09,200
Yeah?
{\ O (spread): <i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>}

2098
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:49,200
Solar Universe

2099
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,200
Sing the Darkness

2100
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:56,200
My hands are shaking, Harmony

2101
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:02,200
Hautau fans will surely burn out

2102
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:04,200
Sunlight

2103
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,200
Yellow

2104
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,200
Over

2105
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
I don’t know you, but...
{\ O (rank): Don't do it}

2106
02:22:11,661 --> 02:22:12,122
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:
{\ O (spread): Dollar Hive}

2107
02:22:12,122 --> 02:22:12,583
Finally, we meet.
{\ O (spread): By the ripple of the sun!}

2108
02:22:14,483 --> 02:22:16,383
Pow!
{\ O (spread): Don’t get carried away!}

2109
02:22:16,383 --> 02:22:18,283
Utterly pathetic!
{\ O (spread): Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.}

2110
02:22:18,283 --> 02:22:20,183
It’s freezing?!
{\ O (spread): You’re the one who put it there!}

2111
02:22:20,183 --> 02:22:22,083
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!
{\ O (spread): Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.}

2112
02:22:22,083 --> 02:22:23,983
I am able to control my own body at will.
{\ O (spread): I’ll be using your lives...}

2113
02:22:23,983 --> 02:22:25,883
If I freeze up all of your veins,
{\ O (spread): To purge this wound!}

2114
02:22:25,883 --> 02:22:27,783
Then you won’t be able to use that power!
{\ O (spread): You bastard!}

2115
02:22:27,783 --> 02:22:29,683
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!
{\ O (spread): Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?}

2116
02:22:29,683 --> 02:22:31,583
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread): Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?}

2117
02:22:31,583 --> 02:22:33,483
Useless, useless, useless, useless!
{\ O (spread): I’ll make you submit!}

2118
02:22:33,483 --> 02:22:35,383
Breathing techniques? Ripple?
{\ O (spread): We finally met}

2119
02:22:35,383 --> 02:22:37,283
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,
{\ O (spread): Don't get on my head}

2120
02:22:37,283 --> 02:22:39,183
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!
{\ O (spread): If I can heal this wound in my stomach}

2121
02:22:39,183 --> 02:22:41,083
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.
{\ O (spread): JoJo, Dio!}

2122
02:22:41,083 --> 02:22:42,983
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...
{\ O (spread): It was attached to you}

2123
02:22:42,983 --> 02:22:44,883
That’s right. Do you remember?
{\ O (spread): What?}

2124
02:22:44,883 --> 02:22:46,783
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?
{\ O (spread): Fire injuries are detected}

2125
02:22:46,783 --> 02:22:48,683
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,
{\ O (spread): With your lives}

2126
02:22:48,683 --> 02:22:50,583
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...
{\ O (spread): I'll disinfect this wound with ultramarine}

2127
02:22:50,583 --> 02:22:52,483
Mary Stuart!
{\ O (spread): you}

2128
02:22:52,483 --> 02:22:54,383
It was about the ones who served her!
{\ O (spread): How many lives did that wound suck out of you?}

2129
02:22:54,383 --> 02:22:56,283
Father told us...
{\ O (spread): You}

2130
02:22:56,283 --> 02:22:58,183
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!
{\ O (spread): Do you remember how many slices of bread you have eaten?}

2131
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:46,200
I'll make you take root

2132
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,200
The blade of the sun

2133
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,200
bread

2134
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,200
Poor poor

2135
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:57,200
this is

2136
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,200
My arms are frozen

2137
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,200
The energy you radiate

2138
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,200
I thought it was blood related.

2139
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:04,200
I am

2140
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:07,200
You can control your body freely

2141
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,200
If you freeze your veins

2142
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,200
I can't use that power

2143
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,200
Don't disrupt your breathing

2144
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,200
Breathe

2145
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,200
Attack

2146
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
Waste, waste, waste, waste

2147
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:27,200
breathe?

2148
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,200
波紋?

2149
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,200
If you blow

2150
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:38,200
It would be fitting if they were playing a fanfare for me

2151
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:49,200
A poor friend that suits you

2152
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,200
What?

2153
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:51,200
fellow

2154
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Yes!
{\ O (rank): Yes.}

2155
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Do you remember?

2156
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,200
Someday

2157
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:59,200
Your father

2158
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of those two proud knights...
{\ O (rank): The story of the knight that my parents told}

2159
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,000
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,
{\ O (spread): what?}

2160
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
The tragic queen sentenced to death

2161
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.
{\ O (spread): 16世紀}

2162
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Mary Seward

2163
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—
{\ O (spread): Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I}

2164
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I told there

2165
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Two people

2166
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
This is a story of knightly pride!
{\ O (rank): It's the story of a proud knight.}

2167
02:25:26,263 --> 02:25:27,526
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>
{\ O (spread): My dad too}

2168
02:25:27,526 --> 02:25:28,789
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>
{\ O (spread): yes}

2169
02:25:28,789 --> 02:25:30,052
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>
{\ O (spread): We listened to it together, didn't we?}

2170
02:25:30,052 --> 02:25:31,315
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>
{\ O (spread): JoeJoe}

2171
02:25:31,315 --> 02:25:32,578
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio}

2172
02:25:32,578 --> 02:25:33,841
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>
{\ O (spread): Today, this tradition is passed down in England.}

2173
02:25:33,841 --> 02:25:35,104
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>
{\ O (spread): Let's talk about two knights}

2174
02:25:35,104 --> 02:25:36,367
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>
{\ O (spread): The spirit that descends downwards is alive}

2175
02:25:36,367 --> 02:25:37,630
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>
{\ O (spread): A tale of knightly pride}

2176
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:38,893
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>
{\ O (spread): It was three hundred years ago}

2177
02:25:38,893 --> 02:25:40,156
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>
{\ O (spread): Two countries competing for support}

2178
02:25:40,156 --> 02:25:41,419
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>
{\ O (spread): Queen Elizabeth Suffers}

2179
02:25:41,419 --> 02:25:42,682
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,
{\ O (spread): Beautiful Mary Seward}

2180
02:25:42,682 --> 02:25:43,945
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.
{\ O (spread): He gave the sword to Mary.}

2181
02:25:43,945 --> 02:25:45,208
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>
{\ O (spread): Two legendary heroes}

2182
02:25:45,208 --> 02:25:46,471
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>
{\ O (spread): Power with You}

2183
02:25:46,471 --> 02:25:47,734
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>
{\ O (spread): It will happen again in the afterlife}

2184
02:25:47,734 --> 02:25:48,997
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>
{\ O (spread): Plaford Solo}

2185
02:25:48,997 --> 02:25:50,260
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>
{\ O (spread): Deliberate Heart}

2186
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:51,523
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>
{\ O (spread): Shoot the shapeshifting enemy}

2187
02:25:51,523 --> 02:25:52,786
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>
{\ O (spread): Two people with no luck}

2188
02:25:52,786 --> 02:25:54,049
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>
{\ O (spread): I turned those two}

2189
02:25:55,312 --> 02:25:56,575
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!
{\ O (spread): <i>For our queen is our life!</i>}

2190
02:25:56,575 --> 02:25:57,838
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (spread): But in the moment they
were to be executed—}

2191
02:25:57,838 --> 02:25:59,101
It can’t be!
{\ O (spread): I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!}

2192
02:25:59,101 --> 02:26:00,364
Such grotesque forms!
{\ O (spread): Your master isn’t being held in the tower.}

2193
02:26:00,364 --> 02:26:01,627
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!
{\ O (spread): I cut off her head myself just yesterday!}

2194
02:26:01,627 --> 02:26:02,890
Don’t you think so?
{\ O (spread): Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!}

2195
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:04,153
Kill them all!
{\ O (spread): After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!}

2196
02:26:04,153 --> 02:26:05,416
Continue from where
you left off on that day!
{\ O (spread): <i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>}

2197
02:26:05,416 --> 02:26:06,679
Tarkus!
{\ O (spread): <i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>}

2198
02:26:06,679 --> 02:26:07,942
Bruford!
{\ O (spread): <i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>}

2199
02:26:07,942 --> 02:26:09,205
Play me a fanfare with their screams!
{\ O (spread): <i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>}

2200
02:26:09,205 --> 02:26:10,468
Our pride!
{\ O (spread): <i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>}

2201
02:26:10,468 --> 02:26:11,731
Great Dark Knight Bruford!
{\ O (spread): <i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>}

2202
02:26:10,468 --> 02:26:11,731
<i>As though it were alive!</i>
{\ O (spread): I will spare my master's life.}

2203
02:26:11,731 --> 02:26:12,994
<i>And that is the story,</i>
{\ O (spread): The way you feel—}

2204
02:26:13,715 --> 02:26:14,436
Your pride, your resentment.
{\ O (spread): <i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>}

2205
02:26:14,436 --> 02:26:15,157
I can’t even imagine it!
{\ O (spread): <i>Until the very end!</i>}

2206
02:26:15,157 --> 02:26:15,878
But I also bear my own burdens!
{\ O (spread): Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!}

2207
02:26:15,878 --> 02:26:16,599
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!
{\ O (spread): Oh, what loyal hearts!}

2208
02:26:16,599 --> 02:26:17,320
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!
{\ O (spread): But those two should
have done a better job!}

2209
02:26:27,418 --> 02:26:37,516
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!
{\ O (spread): I will stand to meet it, as a knight!}

2210
02:26:37,516 --> 02:26:47,614
Alright, go ahead!
{\ O (spread): The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!}

2211
02:26:47,614 --> 02:26:57,712
We’ll duel as knights!
{\ O (spread): It might be as you say, however—}

2212
02:26:57,712 --> 02:27:07,810
Run away, you two!
{\ O (spread): There is nothing that is without meaning.}

2213
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:17,908
Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread): The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.}

2214
02:27:17,908 --> 02:27:28,006
I won’t let you interfere!
{\ O (spread): Everything is connected!}

2215
02:27:28,006 --> 02:27:38,104
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>
{\ O (spread): I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!}

2216
02:27:38,104 --> 02:27:48,202
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>}

2217
02:27:48,202 --> 02:27:58,300
Old man!
{\ O (spread): <i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>}

2218
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:08,398
Don’t come any closer!
{\ O (spread): <i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>}

2219
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:18,496
Damn it...
{\ O (spread): <i>Either one—</i>}

2220
02:28:18,496 --> 02:28:28,594
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>JoJo</i>}

2221
02:28:28,594 --> 02:28:38,692
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Dio</i>}

2222
02:28:38,692 --> 02:28:48,790
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>
{\ O (spread): <i>Could be said to be correct!</i>}

2223
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:58,888
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>
{\ O (spread): What a loyalty}

2224
02:28:58,888 --> 02:29:08,986
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>
{\ O (spread): But they should have done better.}

2225
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
In the end, I couldn't do anything in the mud

2226
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
It could be said that it was a pointless death

2227
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Honourable knight,
{\ O (rank): You may be right.}

2228
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>
{\ O (rank): But nothing is meaningless}

2229
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
The same goes for when you came to this house.

2230
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
It's all connected

2231
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I want to believe they continued to see the stars.

2232
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:28,000
People live in a prison called fate

2233
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Reach out your hand there

2234
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And you, Tarkus!
{\ O (rank): Are you seeing stars?}

2235
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Or somewhere

2236
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Both

2237
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Joe John

2238
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Dio

2239
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Call it justice

2240
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,940
Hahahahaha... those two...

2241
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:10,900
I made it into a weapon of revenge that can blow away even demons.

2242
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:13,640
I am...

2243
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:18,040
Even history can be your servant!

2244
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:18,840
No way...

2245
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:22,160
Hahahahahaha...

2246
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,480
Hahahaha...

2247
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,060
Oh no...

2248
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:29,060
Hahahaha

2249
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:31,060
What is this appearance?

2250
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
Our grudge!
{\ O (rank): To avenge a grudge}

2251
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,060
What an embarrassing sight

2252
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:39,060
Don't you think so?

2253
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,060
Fucking hell!
{\ O (rank): Kill them all.}

2254
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:45,060
A continuation of that day

2255
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
Tarkus!
{\ O (rank): Tarkus}

2256
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,060
Is revenge your answer?
{\ O (spread): Braford}

2257
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:48,560
Is that what you take pride in?
{\ O (spread): Let's scream "Fansfare"}

2258
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:49,060
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!
{\ O (spread): Above us}

2259
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:49,560
You can lecture me after you win!
{\ O (spread): Our}

2260
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:50,060
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>
{\ O (spread): I am the Dark Knight Bruford!}

2261
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:50,560
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>
{\ O (spread): and Tarkus}

2262
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,060
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>
{\ O (spread): That man’s pride...}

2263
02:30:51,060 --> 02:30:51,560
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>
{\ O (spread): I can't imagine the resentment}

2264
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:52,060
Old man!
{\ O (spread): But to me too}

2265
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:52,560
Melt!
{\ O (spread): There's something I'm carrying}

2266
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:53,060
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!
{\ O (spread): We're the ones who'll eat this guy.}

2267
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:53,560
Speedwagon...
{\ O (spread): Cartilage}

2268
02:30:53,560 --> 02:30:54,060
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>
{\ O (spread): It's delicious}

2269
02:30:54,060 --> 02:30:54,560
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>
{\ O (spread): The man's pride}

2270
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:55,060
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>
{\ O (spread): I take it as a kiss}

2271
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:55,560
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>
{\ O (spread): My master}

2272
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:56,060
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I'm in Braford}

2273
02:30:56,060 --> 02:30:56,560
Cut finely, beat of my blood!
{\ O (spread): The end of this brave man's life}

2274
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:57,060
Let it somehow be restored!
{\ O (spread): I want to draw}

2275
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:31,060
Okay, that's good.

2276
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:33,060
Come on, it's a kiss duel

2277
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:39,060
Run away, both of you.

2278
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:41,060
Joe Stan

2279
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:43,060
Tarkus

2280
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,060
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>
{\ O (rank): I won't let you get in my way}

2281
02:31:53,460 --> 02:32:01,860
Just now,
{\ O (spread): a}

2282
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:10,260
That means that now,
{\ O (spread): In the wilderness of memory}

2283
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:09,060
Atlantic

2284
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,060
That morning sun

2285
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:18,660
That’s why...
{\ O (spread): Hit}

2286
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:13,060
It was red as blood

2287
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:19,060
Osa

2288
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:27,060
So this is what it means to be human?
{\ O (spread): smoking}

2289
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:21,060
You're not coming

2290
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:25,060
ah

2291
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Luck!
{\ O (rank): Fuck}

2292
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
Pluck!
{\ O (rank): Fuck}

2293
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:33,060
I can't do anything

2294
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,060
I'm already grateful

2295
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:37,060
I don't have anything

2296
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:39,060
I'm powerless

2297
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,060
Wait a minute

2298
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:43,060
Don't mess with me, even at a time like this

2299
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:45,060
Even if you give up, it still hurts

2300
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:47,060
Continue to deceive

2301
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>
{\ O (rank): Tomorrow for sure}

2302
02:32:50,810 --> 02:32:52,560
And also...
{\ O (spread): Tomorrow for sure}

2303
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:54,310
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...
{\ O (spread): you}

2304
02:32:54,310 --> 02:32:56,060
Damn you!
{\ O (spread): Like I'm alive}

2305
02:32:56,060 --> 02:32:57,810
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I kept chasing}

2306
02:32:57,810 --> 02:32:59,560
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!
{\ O (spread): Let's make a tragedy}

2307
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:01,310
Just as I thought...
{\ O (spread): Is revenge your identity?}

2308
02:33:01,310 --> 02:33:03,060
I, Dio, will—
{\ O (spread): Is that your pride?}

2309
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
What the...
{\ O (rank): What if}

2310
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:07,060
Fight for your pride

2311
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:09,060
and

2312
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:11,060
If we win

2313
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,060
I hope you win

2314
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:15,060
What is your heart now?

2315
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,060
Let me shake it off

2316
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:19,060
It's not the pain that's scary

2317
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,060
Why aren’t you moving?
{\ O (rank): What you should know}

2318

2319
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:25,060

Melt

2323
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,060
This pain means nothing to me!
{\ O (rank): I came along to die}

2324
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:51,060
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread): Speed ​​moves}

2325
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:53,060
Someday tomorrow

2326
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:57,060
What an embarrassment of a knight!
{\ O (spread): Now my heart}

2327
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:55,060
Don't wait

2328
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:57,060
I start walking

2329
02:33:57,060 --> 02:34:03,060
He never got his revenge!
{\ O (spread): Let me shake it off}

2330
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:01,060
Should believe

2331
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:05,060
Should be reclaimed

2332
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:09,060
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Look at you}

2333
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:09,060

No!
{\ O (rank): now}

2335
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:19,060
I'll carve it

2336
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,060
Blood Beat

2337
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:27,060
you

2338
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060

{\ O (rank): Please bring back that proud heart}

Bruford...
{\ O (rank): Branboard}

2342
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:39,060
I like this

2343
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Pain?
{\ O (rank): pain}

2344
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,060
Why doesn't it work?

2345
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You said “pain”.
{\ O (rank): You just said pain}

2346
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:55,060
You can feel pain!
{\ O (rank): You are feeling pain now}

2347
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Pain...
{\ O (rank): pain}

2348
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I stopped fighting you.
{\ O (rank): So I stopped fighting with you}

2349
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That’s why you stopped your sword.
{\ O (rank): So you stopped the sword}

2350
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a great knight.
{\ O (rank): You are a proud knight}

2351
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Human

2352
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
The pain

2353
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is proof of life!
{\ O (rank): Proof of Life}

2354
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You are human!
{\ O (rank): Is this a human?}

2355
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Because there is pain

2356
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.
{\ O (rank): I can feel the joy of being here now}

2357
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.
{\ O (rank): A strange sense of peace}

2358
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I feel now

2359
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Bravo

2360
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.
{\ O (rank): Let me make you follow the words engraved on my sword}

2361
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Good luck

2362
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And courage

2363
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:22,000
To save souls

2364
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
What did he have to be joyful about!
{\ O (rank): That I have to kill}

2365
02:36:26,315 --> 02:36:27,630
How could you!
{\ O (spread): you}

2366
02:36:27,630 --> 02:36:28,945
I take pride in victory!
{\ O (spread): Queen Queen}

2367
02:36:28,945 --> 02:36:30,260
Fuck!
{\ O (spread): No way}

2368
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:31,575
I’ll get you!
{\ O (spread): Defeating the Black Knight}

2369
02:36:31,575 --> 02:36:32,890
I’ll get you for this!
{\ O (spread): also}

JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Hey baby!}

2372
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,835
My final ripple...
{\ O (spread): I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!}

2373
02:36:36,835 --> 02:36:38,150
My... dying wish is...
{\ O (spread): what}

2374
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:39,465
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!}

2375
02:36:39,465 --> 02:36:40,780
If we lose you—
{\ O (spread): Hamon}

2376
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:42,095
There’s no time to be sad.
{\ O (spread): It's dangerous}

2377
02:36:42,095 --> 02:36:43,410
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!
{\ O (spread): A knight's disgrace}

2378
02:36:43,410 --> 02:36:44,725
I...
{\ O (spread): What's the point of not repaying your grudge?}

2379
02:36:44,725 --> 02:36:46,040
I lived my own life to the fullest.
{\ O (spread): What is joy?}

2380
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:47,355
In the end,
{\ O (spread): Queen}

2381
02:36:47,355 --> 02:36:48,670
I leave everything I have to you.
{\ O (spread): Queen}

For victory!

Victory is our pride

{\ O (rank): I used to underestimate you, but now I respect you}

That’s because I’ve realised something!
{\ O (rank): Because I realized that}

If there is a God that controls fate,
{\ O (rank): If God controls destiny}

Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

You’re the reason I got this power,

And you’re the reason why...

03:04:03,876 --> 03:04:09,568
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread): The stars shine}

2760
03:04:09,568 --> 03:04:15,260
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread): I saw mud}

2761
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:20,952
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.
{\ O (spread): Lyrics, composition, arrangement, and arrangement}

2762
03:04:20,952 --> 03:04:26,644
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.
{\ O (spread): 【whale】}

2763
03:04:26,644 --> 03:04:32,336
Thank you for today.
{\ O (spread): I'm really happy that I've been able to gradually get involved in this way.}

2764
03:04:32,336 --> 03:04:38,028
The musical will close tomorrow, though.
{\ O (spread): So please take this opportunity to say a little thank you to your teacher.}

2765
03:04:38,028 --> 03:04:43,720
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread): Thank you so much, Dr. Araps, for gradually disrupting things.}

2766
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:49,412
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.
{\ O (spread): And thank you to my childhood friend Imamura.}

2767
03:04:49,412 --> 03:04:55,104
There have been many
things that led to this day.
{\ O (spread): Thanks!}

2768
03:04:55,104 --> 03:05:00,796
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...
{\ O (spread): Now, please, Mr. Koo.}

2769
03:05:00,796 --> 03:05:06,488
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...
{\ O (spread): I had the opportunity to play Inspector Archer. My name is Yabatsu Kou.}

2770
03:05:06,488 --> 03:05:12,180
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.
{\ O (spread): This is my first time performing in such a big musical, and musicals are the best.}

2771
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:17,872
And foremost, the people
who came every day—
{\ O (spread): Is it possible to be this happy?}

2772
03:05:17,872 --> 03:05:23,564
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—
{\ O (spread): This time in particular, I was able to do something that I personally will never be able to experience again.}

2773
03:05:23,564 --> 03:05:29,256
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.
{\ O (spread): Well, I got to see everything that the staff were doing behind the scenes,}

2774
03:05:29,256 --> 03:05:34,948
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.
{\ O (spread): Even today, when I watched it, all sorts of things kept going round and round in my head, and I was constantly moved.}

2775
03:05:34,948 --> 03:05:40,640
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.
{\ O (spread): This musical is really moving, isn't it?}

2776
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:46,332
From the bottom of my heart,
{\ O (spread): Really.}

2777
03:05:46,332 --> 03:05:52,024
Pow.
{\ O (spread): I'm so glad.}

2778
03:05:52,024 --> 03:05:57,716
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!
{\ O (spread): To everyone here in the theater, to all the performers, to all the staff,}

2779
03:05:57,716 --> 03:06:03,408
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.
{\ O (spread): I'm really grateful to all the staff.}

2780
03:06:03,408 --> 03:06:09,100
Thank you for today!
{\ O (spread): Thank you so much for supporting this reset, this moving fortress.}

2781
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:14,792
Did you have fun, everyone?!
{\ O (spread): And, especially for us, this time we were reminded once again that the greatest source of nourishment is the smiles of our customers, as seen here.}

2782
03:06:14,792 --> 03:06:20,484
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.
{\ O (spread): It was a lecture that really made me feel that very strongly.}

2783
03:06:20,484 --> 03:06:26,176
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.
{\ O (spread): I am truly happy that I was able to give such a miraculous lecture all the way to the end.}

2784
03:06:26,176 --> 03:06:31,868
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.
{\ O (spread): Thank you everyone in the cast!}

2785
03:06:34,264 --> 03:06:36,660
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.
{\ O (spread): I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.}

2786
03:06:36,660 --> 03:06:39,056
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!
{\ O (spread): I—are you worried?}

2787
03:06:39,056 --> 03:06:41,452
Everyone, do your best!
{\ O (spread): Nah, it’s probably okay.}

2788
03:06:41,452 --> 03:06:43,848
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!
{\ O (spread): -I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!}

2789
03:06:43,848 --> 03:06:46,244
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?
{\ O (spread): -He’s—that’s in the past.}

2790
03:06:46,244 --> 03:06:48,640
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!
{\ O (spread): Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.}

2791
03:06:48,640 --> 03:06:51,036
I’m gonna watch it too!
{\ O (spread): I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.}

2792
03:06:51,036 --> 03:06:53,432
Yeah, I’ll watch too.
{\ O (spread): First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,}

2793
03:06:53,432 --> 03:06:55,828
Pardon me.
{\ O (spread): It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.}

2794
03:06:55,828 --> 03:06:58,224
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!
{\ O (spread): And I’m relieved that we made it.}

2795
03:06:58,224 --> 03:07:00,620
Truly, thank you for today!
{\ O (spread): Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!}

2796
03:07:00,620 --> 03:07:03,016
{\an8}[TN: Everyone’s muted for about 2 min]
{\ O (spread): Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.}

2797
03:07:03,016 --> 03:07:05,412
[INAUDIBLE]
{\ O (spread): But when we made it to opening day,}

2798
03:07:05,412 --> 03:07:07,808
MAMORU: It’s already over.
{\ O (spread): At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,}

2799
03:07:07,808 --> 03:07:10,204
[INAUDIBLE]
{\ O (spread): Which has continued up through today.}

2800
03:07:10,204 --> 03:07:12,600
Definitely, please support
tomorrow’s performance too!
{\ O (spread): Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.}

2801
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:14,996
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!
{\ O (spread): Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.}

2802
03:07:14,996 --> 03:07:17,392
MAMORU: Do your best!
{\ O (spread): For having supported us up to this point.}

2803
03:08:14,324 --> 03:08:20,016
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.
{\ O (spread): Thank you very much. Thank you so very much.}

2804
03:08:20,016 --> 03:08:25,708
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?
{\ O (spread): Everyone, please check out Kouchi's Proud Funding page.}

2805
03:08:25,708 --> 03:08:31,400
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.
{\ O (spread): thank you.}

2806
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:37,092
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.
{\ O (spread): For more details, please click here.}

2807
03:08:37,092 --> 03:08:42,784
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!
{\ O (spread): 【applause】}

2808
03:08:42,784 --> 03:08:48,476
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.
{\ O (spread): Now, we're all connected.}

2809
03:08:48,476 --> 03:08:54,168
Excuse yourself...
{\ O (spread): We're connected.}

2810
03:08:54,168 --> 03:08:59,860
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.
{\ O (spread): See you at the next theater.}

2811
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:05,552
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.
{\ O (spread): Thank you very much.}

2812
03:09:05,552 --> 03:09:11,244
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.
{\ O (spread): 【applause】}

2813
03:09:11,244 --> 03:09:16,936
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.
{\ O (spread): Get rich.}

2814
03:09:16,936 --> 03:09:22,628
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread): Get rich.}

2815
03:09:22,628 --> 03:09:28,320
You were just that wonderful.
{\ O (spread): [Laughter]}

2816
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:34,012
[INAUDIBLE]
{\ O (spread): Get rich.}

2817
03:09:34,012 --> 03:09:39,704
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...
{\ O (spread): thank you.}

2818
03:09:39,704 --> 03:09:45,396
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—
{\ O (spread): [Laughter]}

2819
03:09:45,396 --> 03:09:51,088
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.
{\ O (spread): Now, Miisa-chan, please.}

2820
03:09:51,088 --> 03:09:56,780
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.
{\ O (spread): yes.}

2821
03:09:56,780 --> 03:10:02,472
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.
{\ O (spread): The hurdle has become even higher.}

2822
03:10:02,472 --> 03:10:08,164
It was wonderful. Thanks!
{\ O (spread): [Laughter]}

2823
03:10:08,164 --> 03:10:13,856
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!
{\ O (spread): I'm not sure if I can speak it well though.}

2824
03:10:13,856 --> 03:10:19,548
Now to everyone at the theatre,
{\ O (spread): This is Shimizu Miisa, who plays Erina Pendle Ton.}

2825
03:10:19,548 --> 03:10:25,240
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—
{\ O (spread): 【applause】}

2826
03:10:25,240 --> 03:10:30,932
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
{\ O (spread): Thank you so much for joining us today.}

2827
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,000
And thank you to everyone who watched the stream.

2828
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,000
What should I say?

2829
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:58,000
It was really thanks to the strength of each cast member and the staff that we were able to get to this great war settlement.

2830
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
And this work.

2831
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:05,000
I think it's all thanks to everyone who supported me.

2832
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:15,000
Please come everyone

2833
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:26,000
Please look at the stars

2834
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
That's it

2835
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
So, Dice, please

2836
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,000
yes

2837
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Speed ​​Mode Role Dice

2838
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
Um

2839
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
It was my first experience

2840
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:51,000
It was really hard for me

2841
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
But really

2842
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Yeah

2843
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
It was really hard though

2844
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:57,000
Already

2845
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
To get support

2846
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:00,000
Like supporting them.

2847
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,000
Words like "support each other"

2848
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:06,000
It really feels like it's going straight into your body.

2849
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
It's a really nice spot

2850
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Thanks to that

2851
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
I was able to get through it.

2852
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,000
in

2853
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:16,000
I can only say the best

2854
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
With everyone here on stage

2855
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
This person also said,

2856
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:21,000
I'm not standing on this stage

2857
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
Although he's not here today

2858
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:26,000
And all the staff who helped create it

2859
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:27,000
and

2860
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:30,000
For the past 5 months

2861
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
I really appreciate that we were able to be together.

2862
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:35,000
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

2863
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:36,000
Um

2864
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
Please love JoJo

2865
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

2866
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
Including everyone who loves me

2867
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,000
Thank you very much

2868
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
Huh

2869
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Ladies please

2870
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I'm Toyama, and I supported the role of Cheppeli.

2871
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
Today

2872
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
Ceppeli

2873
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Cheplisen

2874
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
Ceppeli

2875
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Nice to meet you again

2876
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:11,000
To everyone attending the Great Athletes' Music Performance and those watching the live stream,

2877
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
Thank you very much

2878
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
If you really think back

2879
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:18,000
that

2880
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:21,000
There were a lot of different things that happened.

2881
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:22,000
Two people from JoJo

2882
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:25,000
Shotaro-kun and now Yuya-kun, who finished here yesterday

2883
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
And another Cheppeli

2884
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Hiro-kun

2885
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:29,000
And alone

2886
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
I've done this much

2887
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:33,000
Led by Mamo-kun, this company is united as one.

2888
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:36,000
With the determination to make it a success

2889
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:39,000
This great player came here with the aim of becoming Rakugo.

2890
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:42,000
Yes, without calling anyone

2891
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
I've been able to come this far

2892
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Of course, the dedicated support of all the staff

2893
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000
It is the result of your efforts.

2894
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:52,000
I only do half of each stage,

2895
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:55,000
Every single performance was met with thunderous applause.

2896
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:56,000
5000 yen

2897
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:57,000
Um, us

2898
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,000
The cast now is

2899
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:01,000
It's really the energy of your ripples.

2900
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
How much courage it gave us

2901
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:06,000
I think we all really feel that way.

2902
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:07,000
That's really true now.

2903
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:10,000
I was there for almost six months, almost five months.

2904
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:13,000
It really is like a family

2905
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:16,000
It's already today and tomorrow will be a valley

2906
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,000
Hey hey

2907
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:19,000
valley?

2908
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
It's a sweet story

2909
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:24,000
Well, let's just leave it as a casual acquaintance.

2910
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
Just a little bit

2911
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
I feel a little lonely though

2912
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:31,000
The world of JoJo that I really love

2913
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
And with my favorite members

2914
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:39,000
I found a group of people who breathed the same air as me at the theater.

2915
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:40,000
Your hearts

2916
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Bang, that was it.

2917
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
It has become my treasure

2918
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

2919
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Thank you very much everyone

2920
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
thank you

2921
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
I want to finish again

2922
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
Blacks

2923
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
Teacher, please

2924
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
good job

2925
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,000
I'm Tetsuya Bessho, who co-starred with Joestar.

2926
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
Thank you for today

2927
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
I am overwhelmed with emotion

2928
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:23,000
I have been involved in a lot of different works.

2929
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:27,000
This work is exactly as the title suggests.

2930
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:30,000
It was a strange adventure.

2931
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,000
hey

2932
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
Really

2933
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
As some of you may know,

2934
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:38,000
Born at the Imperial Theatre at the opening of Haran

2935
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:42,000
The current Imperial Theatre is closing.

2936
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:45,000
It will be the last new work

2937
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:49,000
I participated without tears.

2938
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
My friends are cast members here.

2939
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
It is staff

2940
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
And the original author

2941
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:58,000
The collectors and the people of the East

2942
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,000
It took five years

2943
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Apparently the script was rewritten 17 times. This work was born out of this process, and has now been well received by everyone, and is now coming to an end.

2944
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:22,240
There are many musicals, including works from overseas, and such works, such as Coordinate Zero, are on Broadway or in the West End, and we are here in Japan,

2945
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:38,240
We will be screening the film for a thousand days and ten thousand days, amplifying it greatly and in a very Japanese style, but I believe that what you have seen this time is a work that has become a coordinate axis, going from zero to one.

2946
03:20:38,240 --> 03:20:48,240
This work may be taken over and performed again someday, but I hope that my colleagues here at Zero One on this coordinate axis will

2947
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:55,240
I really love them all and feel like they are all my sons and daughters.

2948
03:20:58,240 --> 03:21:15,240
There was only one difference. We both have the same father, and as a father, I would like to continue to tenaciously survive in the musical world as a friend who drinks mud and stars together, both pure and murky.

2949
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:32,240
I am so grateful to have two wonderful sons like this, and today, you may be watching me somewhere, but my son is also Yuyaku.

2950
03:21:32,240 --> 03:21:36,240
I was able to take part in a truly wonderful production as a father.

2951
03:21:36,240 --> 03:21:48,240
If you have any worries, I hope you will just think that in the end, everything is connected within you, and that everything has meaning.

2952
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:56,240
I hope this work will make you think that there is surely light and stars beyond. Thank you very much.

2953
03:21:56,240 --> 03:22:04,240
【applause】

2954
03:22:04,240 --> 03:22:07,240
Now, Mambo, please.

2955
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:16,240
【applause】

2956
03:22:16,240 --> 03:22:20,240
I don't know where to start, really.

2957
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:31,240
But anyway, I'm glad I met you. Really.

2958
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:43,240
【applause】

2959
03:22:44,240 --> 03:22:54,240
We try to provide entertainment, but sometimes it's tough.

2960
03:22:54,240 --> 03:23:02,240
Well, it's scary sometimes.

2961
03:23:02,240 --> 03:23:12,240
But, as Dice said earlier, it's not just about supporting each other in the literal sense,

2962
03:23:12,240 --> 03:23:23,240
This company made me realize that this is what it means to truly support one another.

2963
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:34,240
Of course, there were a lot of things that happened.

2964
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:45,240
Those are the only words I can express right now, but I want to express more than that.

2965
03:23:45,240 --> 03:23:58,240
I was able to hold it as a treasure, and more than anything, I was able to share it with so many people.

2966
03:23:58,240 --> 03:24:02,240
[Laughter]

2967
03:24:02,240 --> 03:24:07,240
【applause】

2968
03:24:07,240 --> 03:24:12,240
Having people enjoy themselves is what makes us happiest.

2969
03:24:12,240 --> 03:24:21,240
I am happy to have been able to experience this with these members.

2970
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:29,240
Jojo's brother passed away last week, but as his father said just now,

2971
03:24:29,240 --> 03:24:39,240
I think we will continue to look forward and pursue various forms of expression in our own individual ways.

2972
03:24:39,240 --> 03:24:44,240
It's still going to be useful.

2973
03:24:44,240 --> 03:24:46,240
[Laughter]

2974
03:24:46,240 --> 03:24:53,240
【applause】

2975
03:24:53,240 --> 03:24:55,240
We'll definitely meet again.

2976
03:24:55,240 --> 03:24:59,240
And I think it would be great to see them again in this JoJo.

2977
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:08,000
It's all connected

2978
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:14,000
I too dream of such a day, and today I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.

2979
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,000
Thank you everyone

2980
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:28,000
I'm going to say something really nice.

2981
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:37,000
I think it will tighten up nicely.

2982
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
thank you

2983
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:43,000
I'm Seitaro Arisa, the person who investigated Jonah.

2984
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:53,000
I don't know if you all really noticed,

2985
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:57,000
Because this is the kind of person I am

2986
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:01,000
Even if I stand in the middle, everyone

2987
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:05,000
A lot of people really supported me.

2988
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:08,000
He was like a warm older brother to me.

2989
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,000
People who are like family

2990
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:13,000
That's fine for you, so just be yourself

2991
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:17,000
Those words alone have really brought me this far

2992
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:21,000
However, when I look around me,

2993
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
This time everyone

2994
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:29,000
I've seen the faces that look like they're in pain

2995
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
Really everyone

2996
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
The curtain won't open

2997
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:37,000
I think I may have caused a lot of anxiety.

2998
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:40,000
That voice is reaching me directly, too.

2999
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:44,000
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3000
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:50,000
I received a lot of messages asking me what was going on.

3001
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:52,000
But I

3002
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,000
I really believe in everyone

3003
03:26:57,000 --> 03:27:00,000
I've already seen everyone working hard here.

3004
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:04,000
I feel like I should just watch it.

3005
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
Just please wait for me

3006
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:11,000
That's really the only feeling I have.

3007
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:15,000
We've all overcome so many big obstacles together

3008
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,000
Even if we don't have any more conversations

3009
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000
It's an invisible bond

3010
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:24,000
It's like we're becoming more and more connected through these things.

3011
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
I've been feeling it ever since the rehearsal studio.

3012
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
After all, open the curtain like this

3013
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:33,000
The other Yuya who plays Jonathan Josser

3014
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:38,000
We've really talked about a lot of things up until today.

3015
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:42,000
Yesterday I was watching Yuya's War Village and Hiro's War Village.

3016
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,000
After all,

3017
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:46,000
It was there today

3018
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:47,000
One more

3019
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:52,000
I felt like I had really completed it.

3020
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
I've seen some really amazing things

3021
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:58,000
I'm glad I worked hard after all.

3022
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:00,000
I really felt that way as of yesterday.

3023
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
Today, everyone was so

3024
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,000
Seeing your happy face

3025
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:10,000
I am truly filled with joy from my heart

3026
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:12,000
As I had originally thought,

3027
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:14,000
I think I was able to witness a historic moment.

3028
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:16,000
World Garden

3029
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
We all really worked hard to create this

3030
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:21,000
already

3031
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
Well, starting with Koishi-san

3032
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
Koishi-san raised the flag and we all felt like we should follow him.

3033
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
I'm trying my best to climb the hill, climb, climb

3034
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:34,000
I think I was able to really make everyone happy today.

3035
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:36,000
Thank you so much

3036
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:47,000
I also spoke without really thinking about it.

3037
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:52,000
Maybe some of you think that's not the case.

3038
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:56,000
This is definitely my feeling

3039
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:58,000
The company's feelings

3040
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:02,000
I may be overconfident today, but

3041
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3042
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:19,000
It's okay to think that

3043
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:31,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also provided support here.

3044
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:38,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also supported them.

3045
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Everyone did their best.

3046
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:51,000
Yuya

3047
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:53,000
Iro-san

3048
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:55,000
thank you

3049
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:08,740
【applause】

3050
03:30:08,740 --> 03:30:11,640
I used this to cut the river.

3051
03:30:11,640 --> 03:30:12,980
[Laughter]

3052
03:30:12,980 --> 03:30:19,680
Also, in front of everyone

3053
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:23,080
So that we can meet as JoJo

3054
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:27,880
And in the future, this work will not only be limited to Japan

3055
03:30:27,880 --> 03:30:29,880
I wish I could stay in the world

3056
03:30:29,880 --> 03:30:33,880
[Laughter]

3057
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:35,880
Embracing big dreams

3058
03:30:35,880 --> 03:30:37,880
I would like to close today

3059
03:30:37,880 --> 03:30:38,880
[Laughter]

3060
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:40,880
Thank you very much

3061
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:46,880
【applause】

3062
03:30:46,880 --> 03:30:48,880
Well, I hope to see you again

3063
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:50,880
Today is truly a day

3064
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:52,880
thank you

3065
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:55,880
【applause】

3066
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:27,880
【applause】

3067
03:31:27,880 --> 03:31:32,880
【applause】

3068
03:31:32,880 --> 03:31:37,880
【applause】

3069
03:31:37,880 --> 03:31:42,880
【applause】

3070
03:31:42,880 --> 03:31:47,880
【applause】

3071
03:31:47,880 --> 03:31:52,880
【applause】

3072
03:31:52,880 --> 03:31:57,880
【applause】

3073
03:31:57,880 --> 03:32:03,880
【applause】

3074
03:32:03,880 --> 03:32:06,880
me

3075
03:32:07,880 --> 03:32:10,880
me

3076
03:32:10,880 --> 03:32:13,880
me

3077
03:32:13,880 --> 03:32:16,880
me

3078
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:19,880
