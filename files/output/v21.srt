I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (rank)}

305
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,175
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (rank)}

306
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.
{\ O (rank)}

307
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
JoJo!
{\ O (rank)}

308
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?
{\ O (rank)}

309
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
Yes, sir.
{\ O (rank)}

310
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
Good.
{\ O (spread)}

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes!
{\ O (spread)}

312
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!
{\ O (spread)}

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Make sure to get along with each other.
{\ O (rank)}

314
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.
{\ O (rank)}

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mister Brando!
{\ O (gap)}

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Nice to have met you!
{\ O (rank)}

317
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don’t touch my bag!
{\ O (spread)}

318
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,420
I was just trying to carry it for—
{\ O (rank)}

319
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,120
That’s enough.
{\ O (rank)}

320
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.
{\ O (rank)}

321
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,180
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!
{\ O (rank)}

322
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.
{\ O (spread)}

323
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
Ta-ta, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

324
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,500
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!
{\ O (spread)}

325
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:24,399
Now then, let me get—
{\ O (spread)}

326
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:24,399
Watch it!
{\ O (spread)}

327
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,659
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!
{\ O (spread)}

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!
{\ O (spread)}

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?
{\ O (rank)}

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ O (spread)}

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (spread)}

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:10,919
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.
{\ O (spread)}

333
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:19,719
Keep your stupid dog away from me!
{\ O (spread)}

334
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:28,520
Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

335
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.
{\ O (spread)}

336
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?
{\ O (spread)}

337
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,495
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (rank)}

338
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,870
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread)}

339
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,245
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

340
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,620
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

341
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,995
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

342
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,370
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

343
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,745
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>
{\ O (rank)}

344
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (spread)}

345
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,919
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>
{\ O (spread)}

346
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,719
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

347
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,520
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

348
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,320
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>
{\ O (spread)}

349
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

350
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

351
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:46,120
It’s just because I love reading so much!
{\ O (spread)}

352
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:54,120
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!
{\ O (spread)}

353
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:02,120
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>
{\ O (rank)}

354
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,120
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread)}

355
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

356
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (spread)}

357
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,620
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

358
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:26,120
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

359
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,120
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

360
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,620
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

361
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,120
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

362
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,620
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>
{\ O (spread)}

363
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

364
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:16,119
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>
{\ O (spread)}

365
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:16,119
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

366
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,120
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,620
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>
{\ O (gap)}

368
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>
{\ O (rank)}

369
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,295
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>
{\ O (rank)}

370
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:57,472
But...
{\ O (spread)}

371
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:02,648
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.
{\ O (rank)}

372
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:07,824
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (gap)}

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>
{\ O (gap)}

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.
{\ O (rank)}

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.
{\ O (spread)}

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ O (spread)}

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (rank)}

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank)}

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here is my question for you:
{\ O (spread)}

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (spread)}

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ O (spread)}

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,666
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?
{\ O (spread)}

383
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,333
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread)}

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank)}

385
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ O (spread)}

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,666
The stars?
{\ O (spread)}

387
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,333
Or the mud?
{\ O (rank)}

388
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think...
{\ O (spread)}

389
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,000
I...
{\ O (rank)}

390
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,666
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (rank)}

391
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,333
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread)}

392
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (spread)}

393
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread)}

394
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread)}

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

396
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,200
They held onto their honour!
{\ O (spread)}

397
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,400
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!
{\ O (rank)}

398
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,600
So what!
{\ O (rank)}

399
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
So what?
{\ O (spread)}

400
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (spread)}

401
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,500
But they—
{\ O (spread)}

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (rank)}

403
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,000
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread)}

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Such regret...
{\ O (spread)}

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (spread)}

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (rank)}

407
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,285
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (rank)}

408
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:22,571
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread)}

409
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,857
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (rank)}

410
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:27,142
Listen!
{\ O (spread)}

411
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,428
You’re a noble! You have it all!
{\ O (spread)}

412
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:31,714
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread)}

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ O (spread)}

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—
{\ O (spread)}

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,500
That’s enough, you two.
{\ O (spread)}

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There’s no right answer to this question.
{\ O (spread)}

417
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,545
Bear in mind—
{\ O (spread)}

418
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread)}

419
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,636
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

420
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:04,181
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

421
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:08,727
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>
{\ O (spread)}

422
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:13,272
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>
{\ O (spread)}

423
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:17,818
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>
{\ O (spread)}

424
00:28:17,818 --> 00:28:22,363
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>
{\ O (spread)}

425
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:26,909
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

426
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:31,454
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>
{\ O (spread)}

427
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,545
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>
{\ O (spread)}

429
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:45,090
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

430
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,636
<i>The opening bell rings</i>
{\ O (spread)}

431
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:54,181
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

432
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:58,727
Oi!
{\ O (spread)}

433
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:03,272
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

434
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:07,818
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!
{\ O (rank)}

435
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:12,363
Our new champion!
{\ O (rank)}

436
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:16,909
You did it, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

437
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:21,454
Danny would be proud!
{\ O (spread)}

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?
{\ O (spread)}

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:30,999
Is there anyone?
{\ O (rank)}

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.
{\ O (rank)}

441
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:30,999
Everyone listen up!
{\ O (spread)}

442
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
His name is Dio Brando!
{\ O (gap)}

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,750
Dio Brando?
{\ O (gap)}

444
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,500
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?
{\ O (rank)}

445
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,250
Yeah! Do it!
{\ O (gap)}

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, let’s do it!
{\ O (rank)}

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:50,999
-Good!
{\ O (rank)}

448
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—
{\ O (spread)}

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.
{\ O (spread)}

450
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That’s the bell!
{\ O (spread)}

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
-Go, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Beat him up!
{\ O (rank)}

453
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What is this move!
{\ O (spread)}

454
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I’ve never seen it before!
{\ O (spread)}

455
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,400
Oi, JoJo!

We bought it from a London art dealer,

On the way back,

JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?
{\ O (spread)}

498
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

Friendship? With a dog?
{\ O (spread)}

I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.
{\ O (spread)}

501

At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

Just when JoJo was about to drown...

A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

It was Danny!

He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.
{\ O (gap)}

509
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.
{\ O (rank)}

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

<i>The waves of the ripple!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1966
02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:45,287
This battle will be an exercise—

1967
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:10,999
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1968
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:10,999
<i>Are resounding through my body!</i>

1969

{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1970
02:19:32,001 --> 02:19:10,999
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>

<i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1973
02:19:32,003 --> 02:19:10,999
<i>Pa-pow-pow-pow with unrelenting heat!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1974
02:19:32,003 --> 02:19:10,999
{\an8}<i>(Heat!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1975

<i>Overdrive!!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1983
02:19:32,008 --> 02:19:10,999
The ripple of the sun! Dio!
{\ O (spread)}

1984
02:19:32,008 --> 02:19:10,999
This is the power
that will defeat you!
{\ O (spread)}

1985
02:19:45,287 --> 02:19:58,925
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!
{\ O (spread)}

1986
02:19:58,925 --> 02:20:12,562
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!
{\ O (spread)}

1987
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:36,200
The north wind made the vikings!
{\ O (spread)}

1988
02:20:36,200 --> 02:19:29,999
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—
{\ O (spread)}

1989
02:20:36,200 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1990
02:20:36,201 --> 02:19:29,999

<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1993
02:20:36,202 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1994
02:20:36,203 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1995
02:20:36,204 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1996
02:20:36,204 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1997
02:20:36,205 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

1998
02:20:36,205 --> 02:19:29,999
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

1999
02:20:36,206 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>

{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2003
02:20:36,208 --> 02:19:29,999
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my

{\ O (spread)}

2004
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
I don’t know you, but...
{\ O (spread)}

2005
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,661
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:
{\ O (spread)}

2006
02:22:11,661 --> 02:22:12,123
Finally, we meet.
{\ O (spread)}

2007
02:22:12,123 --> 02:22:12,584
Don’t get carried away!
{\ O (spread)}

2008
02:22:12,584 --> 02:22:13,046
Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.
{\ O (spread)}

2009
02:22:13,046 --> 02:22:13,507
You’re the one who put it there!
{\ O (spread)}

2010
02:22:13,507 --> 02:22:13,969
Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.
{\ O (rank)}

2011
02:22:13,969 --> 02:22:14,430
I’ll be using your lives...
{\ O (spread)}

2012
02:22:14,430 --> 02:22:14,892
To purge this wound!
{\ O (spread)}

2013
02:22:14,892 --> 02:22:15,353
You bastard!
{\ O (spread)}

2014
02:22:15,353 --> 02:22:15,815
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?
{\ O (spread)}

2015
02:22:15,815 --> 02:22:16,276
Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?
{\ O (spread)}

2016
02:22:16,276 --> 02:22:16,738
I’ll make you submit!
{\ O (spread)}

2017
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
By the ripple of the sun!
{\ O (spread)}

2018
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,866
Pow!
{\ O (spread)}

2019
02:22:21,866 --> 02:22:24,533
Utterly pathetic!
{\ O (spread)}

2020
02:22:24,533 --> 02:22:27,200
It’s freezing?!
{\ O (spread)}

2021
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,866
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!
{\ O (spread)}

2022
02:22:29,866 --> 02:22:32,533
I am able to control my own body at will.
{\ O (spread)}

2023
02:22:32,533 --> 02:22:35,200
If I freeze up all of your veins,
{\ O (spread)}

2024
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,866
Then you won’t be able to use that power!
{\ O (spread)}

2025
02:22:37,866 --> 02:22:40,533
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!
{\ O (spread)}

2026
02:22:40,533 --> 02:22:43,200
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread)}

2027
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,866
Useless, useless, useless, useless!
{\ O (spread)}

2028
02:22:45,866 --> 02:22:48,533
Breathing techniques? Ripple?
{\ O (rank)}

2029
02:22:48,533 --> 02:22:51,200
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,
{\ O (spread)}

2030
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,866
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!
{\ O (spread)}

2031
02:22:53,866 --> 02:22:56,533
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.
{\ O (spread)}

2032
02:22:56,533 --> 02:22:59,200
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...
{\ O (spread)}

2033
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,200
JoJo, Dio!
{\ O (spread)}

2034
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,866
That’s right. Do you remember?
{\ O (rank)}

2035
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:36,400
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,
{\ O (spread)}

2036
02:23:01,866 --> 02:23:04,533
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?
{\ O (spread)}

2037
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,200
What?
{\ O (rank)}

2038
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:30,560
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,
{\ O (spread)}

2039
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:52,920
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...
{\ O (rank)}

2040
02:23:36,400 --> 02:24:11,600
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.
{\ O (spread)}

2041
02:23:52,920 --> 02:24:15,280
Mary Stuart!
{\ O (spread)}

2042
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:46,800
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—
{\ O (spread)}

2043
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:37,640
It was about the ones who served her!
{\ O (spread)}

2044
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Yes!
{\ O (spread)}

2045
02:24:53,200 --> 02:22:58,199
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!
{\ O (spread)}

2046
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of those two proud knights...
{\ O (spread)}

2047
02:25:02,000 --> 02:24:52,199
Father told us...
{\ O (rank)}

2048
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
This is a story of knightly pride!
{\ O (spread)}

2049
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,263
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2050
02:25:26,263 --> 02:25:27,526
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2051
02:25:27,526 --> 02:25:28,789
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2052
02:25:28,789 --> 02:25:30,052
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2053
02:25:30,052 --> 02:25:31,315
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2054
02:25:31,315 --> 02:25:32,578
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2055
02:25:32,578 --> 02:25:33,842
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2056
02:25:33,842 --> 02:25:35,105
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2057
02:25:35,105 --> 02:25:36,368
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2058
02:25:36,368 --> 02:25:37,631
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2059
02:25:37,631 --> 02:25:38,894
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2060
02:25:38,894 --> 02:25:40,157
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2061
02:25:40,157 --> 02:25:41,421
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,
{\ O (spread)}

2062
02:25:41,421 --> 02:25:42,684
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.
{\ O (spread)}

2063
02:25:42,684 --> 02:25:43,947
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2064
02:25:43,947 --> 02:25:45,210
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2065
02:25:45,210 --> 02:25:46,473
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2066
02:25:46,473 --> 02:25:47,736
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2067
02:25:47,736 --> 02:25:49,000
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2068
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,263
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2069
02:25:50,263 --> 02:25:51,526
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2070
02:25:51,526 --> 02:25:52,789
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2071
02:25:52,789 --> 02:25:54,052
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2072
02:25:54,052 --> 02:25:55,315
But in the moment they
were to be executed—
{\ O (spread)}

2073
02:25:55,315 --> 02:25:56,578
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!
{\ O (spread)}

2074
02:25:56,578 --> 02:25:57,842
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.
{\ O (spread)}

2075
02:25:57,842 --> 02:25:59,105
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!
{\ O (spread)}

2076
02:25:59,105 --> 02:26:00,368
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!
{\ O (spread)}

2077
02:26:00,368 --> 02:26:01,631
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!
{\ O (spread)}

2078
02:26:01,631 --> 02:26:02,894
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2079
02:26:02,894 --> 02:26:04,157
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2080
02:26:04,157 --> 02:26:05,421
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2081
02:26:05,421 --> 02:26:06,684
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2082
02:26:06,684 --> 02:26:07,947
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2083
02:26:07,947 --> 02:26:09,210
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2084
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:10,473
<i>As though it were alive!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2085
02:26:10,473 --> 02:26:11,736
<i>And that is the story,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2086
02:26:11,736 --> 02:26:13,000
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2087
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,263
<i>Until the very end!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2088
02:26:14,263 --> 02:26:15,526
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!
{\ O (spread)}

2089
02:26:15,526 --> 02:26:16,789
Oh, what loyal hearts!
{\ O (spread)}

2090
02:26:16,789 --> 02:26:18,052
But those two should
have done a better job!
{\ O (spread)}

2091
02:26:18,052 --> 02:26:19,315
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

2092
02:26:19,315 --> 02:26:20,578
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!
{\ O (spread)}

2093
02:26:20,578 --> 02:26:21,842
It might be as you say, however—
{\ O (spread)}

2094
02:26:21,842 --> 02:26:23,105
There is nothing that is without meaning.
{\ O (spread)}

2095
02:26:23,105 --> 02:26:24,368
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.
{\ O (spread)}

2096
02:26:24,368 --> 02:26:25,631
Everything is connected!
{\ O (spread)}

2097
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:26,894
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

2098
02:26:26,894 --> 02:26:28,157
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (rank)}

2099
02:26:28,157 --> 02:26:29,421
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2100
02:26:29,421 --> 02:26:30,684
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2101
02:26:30,684 --> 02:26:31,947
<i>Either one—</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2102
02:26:31,947 --> 02:26:33,210
<i>JoJo</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2103
02:26:33,210 --> 02:26:34,473
<i>Dio</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2104
02:26:34,473 --> 02:26:35,736
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2105
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I turned those two
{\ O (spread)}

2106
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:58,338
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!
{\ O (spread)}

2107
02:26:58,338 --> 02:27:17,676
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (spread)}

2108
02:27:17,676 --> 02:27:37,015
It can’t be!
{\ O (spread)}

2109
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The way you feel—
{\ O (spread)}

2110
02:27:37,000 --> 02:28:11,010
Your pride, your resentment.
{\ O (rank)}

2111
02:27:37,015 --> 02:27:56,353
Such grotesque forms!
{\ O (spread)}

2112
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
My master—I, Bruford,
{\ O (spread)}

2113

Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!
{\ O (spread)}

2114
02:27:56,353 --> 02:28:15,691
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!
{\ O (rank)}

02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:45,020
I can’t even imagine it!
{\ O (spread)}

2116

Don’t you think so?
{\ O (spread)}

2117

Alright, go ahead!
{\ O (spread)}

2118

Kill them all!

But I also bear my own burdens!
{\ O (spread)}

2120

We’ll duel as knights!
{\ O (spread)}

Continue from where
you left off on that day!
{\ O (rank)}

Honourable knight,

<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:29:19,529 --> 02:29:48,039
Run away, you two!
{\ O (spread)}

If you want to preach, then fight

You can lecture me after you win!

Our grudge!

Don’t come any closer!
{\ O (spread)}

02:30:47,067 --> 02:30:39,059
Damn it...

02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

That man’s pride...

I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

Pluck!
{\ O (rank)}

2166
02:32:31,060 --> 02:33:09,194
To think, I had to kill him

<i>Find the strength to

02:32:49,064 --> 02:31:43,059
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

Why aren’t you moving?

This pain means nothing to me!

{\ O (rank)}

2182
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
No!
{\ O (spread)}

2183
02:34:11,060 --> 02:36:03,029
How could you!
{\ O (spread)}

2184
02:34:25,462 --> 02:35:03,597
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!
{\ O (spread)}

2185
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060
Please... This knight’s proud heart,
{\ O (spread)}

2186
02:34:29,060 --> 02:30:57,059
Let it somehow be restored!
{\ O (rank)}

02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,060
Bruford...
{\ O (spread)}

2188
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Pain?
{\ O (rank)}

2189
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:50,529
That’s why...
{\ O (spread)}

2190
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You said “pain”.
{\ O (rank)}

2191
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,059
That means that now,
{\ O (rank)}

2192
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:55,060
You can feel pain!
{\ O (rank)}

2193
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Pain...
{\ O (rank)}

2194
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I stopped fighting you.
{\ O (rank)}

2195
02:35:03,597 --> 02:35:41,731
Just as I thought...
{\ O (spread)}

2196
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That’s why you stopped your sword.
{\ O (rank)}

2197
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a great knight.
{\ O (rank)}

2198
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is proof of life!
{\ O (spread)}

2199
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,500
So this is what it means to be human?
{\ O (rank)}

2200
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You are human!
{\ O (rank)}

2201
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.
{\ O (spread)}

2202
02:35:41,731 --> 02:36:19,865
I, Dio, will—
{\ O (spread)}

2203
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.
{\ O (spread)}

2204
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.
{\ O (spread)}

2205
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
What did he have to be joyful about!
{\ O (spread)}

2206
02:36:25,000 --> 02:34:09,059
JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

2207

You are my hope.
{\ O (spread)}

Hey baby!
{\ O (rank)}

2209
02:37:00,000 --> 02:33:03,059
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!
{\ O (spread)}

2210
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!
{\ O (spread)}

2211
02:37:09,000 --> 02:36:21,999
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (rank)}

2212
02:37:09,002 --> 02:36:21,999
What an embarrassment of a knight!
{\ O (spread)}

2213
02:37:09,005 --> 02:36:21,999
He never got his revenge!
{\ O (spread)}

2214
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
For victory!
{\ O (spread)}

2215

I take pride in victory!
{\ O (spread)}

2216
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:06,600
Fuck!
{\ O (spread)}

2217
02:38:06,600 --> 02:38:10,900
I’ll get you!
{\ O (rank)}

2218
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:15,200
I’ll get you for this!
{\ O (gap)}

JoJo!
{\ O (rank)}

2221
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:28,100
My final ripple...
{\ O (rank)}

02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:32,400
My... dying wish is...
{\ O (spread)}

2223
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:36,700
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

2224
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
He collapsed.
{\ O (spread)}

02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!
{\ O (rank)}

Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!
{\ O (spread)}

Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread)}

If we lose you—

There’s no time to be sad.
{\ O (spread)}

The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

In the end,

I had a friend and a son

Speedwagon coolly withdraws.
{\ O (spread)}

2577
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:54,757
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2578
03:03:54,757 --> 03:04:02,715
This is a public [streamed] performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2579
03:04:02,715 --> 03:04:10,672
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread)}

2580
03:04:10,672 --> 03:04:18,630
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread)}

2581
03:04:18,630 --> 03:04:26,587
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.
{\ O (spread)}

2582
03:04:26,587 --> 03:04:34,545
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.
{\ O (spread)}

2583
03:04:34,545 --> 03:04:42,503
Thank you for today.
{\ O (spread)}

2584
03:04:42,503 --> 03:04:50,460
The musical will close tomorrow, though.
{\ O (spread)}

2585
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:58,418
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread)}

2586
03:04:58,418 --> 03:05:06,375
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.
{\ O (spread)}

2587
03:05:06,375 --> 03:05:14,333
There have been many
things that led to this day.
{\ O (spread)}

2588
03:05:14,333 --> 03:05:22,290
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...
{\ O (spread)}

2589
03:05:22,290 --> 03:05:30,248
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...
{\ O (spread)}

2590
03:05:30,248 --> 03:05:38,206
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.
{\ O (spread)}

2591
03:05:38,206 --> 03:05:46,163
And foremost, the people
who came every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2592
03:05:46,163 --> 03:05:54,121
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2593
03:05:54,121 --> 03:06:02,078
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.
{\ O (spread)}

2594
03:06:02,078 --> 03:06:10,036
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.
{\ O (spread)}

2595
03:06:10,036 --> 03:06:17,993
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.
{\ O (spread)}

2596
03:06:17,993 --> 03:06:25,951
From the bottom of my heart,
{\ O (spread)}

2597
03:06:25,951 --> 03:06:33,909
Pow.
{\ O (spread)}

2598
03:06:33,909 --> 03:06:41,866
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!
{\ O (spread)}

2599
03:06:41,866 --> 03:06:49,824
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.
{\ O (spread)}

2600
03:06:49,824 --> 03:06:57,781
Thank you for today!
{\ O (spread)}

2601
03:06:57,781 --> 03:07:05,739
Did you have fun, everyone?!
{\ O (spread)}

2602
03:07:05,739 --> 03:07:13,696
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.
{\ O (spread)}

2603
03:07:13,696 --> 03:07:21,654
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2604
03:07:21,654 --> 03:07:29,612
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.
{\ O (spread)}

2605
03:07:29,612 --> 03:07:37,569
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.
{\ O (spread)}

2606
03:07:37,569 --> 03:07:45,527
I—are you worried?
{\ O (spread)}

2607
03:07:45,527 --> 03:07:53,484
Nah, it’s probably okay.
{\ O (spread)}

2608
03:07:53,484 --> 03:08:01,442
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!
{\ O (spread)}

2609
03:08:01,442 --> 03:08:09,400
-He’s—that’s in the past.
{\ O (spread)}

2610
03:08:09,400 --> 03:08:17,357
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.
{\ O (spread)}

2611
03:08:17,357 --> 03:08:25,315
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.
{\ O (spread)}

2612
03:08:25,315 --> 03:08:33,272
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,
{\ O (spread)}

2613
03:08:33,272 --> 03:08:41,230
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2614
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:49,187
And I’m relieved that we made it.
{\ O (spread)}

2615
03:08:49,187 --> 03:08:57,145
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!
{\ O (spread)}

2616
03:08:57,145 --> 03:09:05,103
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2617
03:09:05,103 --> 03:09:13,060
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2618
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:21,018
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2619
03:09:21,018 --> 03:09:28,975
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2620
03:09:28,975 --> 03:09:36,933
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.
{\ O (spread)}

2621
03:09:36,933 --> 03:09:44,890
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.
{\ O (spread)}

2622
03:09:44,890 --> 03:09:52,848
For having supported us up to this point.
{\ O (spread)}

2623
03:09:52,848 --> 03:10:00,806
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:10:00,806 --> 03:10:08,763
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:10:08,763 --> 03:10:16,721
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:10:16,721 --> 03:10:24,678
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:10:24,678 --> 03:10:32,636
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!
{\ O (spread)}

2628
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thanks!
{\ O (spread)}

2629
03:10:32,636 --> 03:10:40,593
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.
{\ O (spread)}

2630
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:44,062
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.
{\ O (spread)}

2631
03:10:40,593 --> 03:10:48,551
Excuse yourself...
{\ O (spread)}

2632
03:10:44,062 --> 03:10:55,125
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!
{\ O (spread)}

2633
03:10:48,551 --> 03:10:56,509
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.
{\ O (spread)}

2634
03:10:55,125 --> 03:11:06,187
Everyone, do your best!
{\ O (spread)}

2635
03:10:56,509 --> 03:11:04,466
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.
{\ O (spread)}

2636
03:11:04,466 --> 03:11:12,424
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.
{\ O (spread)}

2637
03:11:06,187 --> 03:11:17,250
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!
{\ O (spread)}

2638
03:11:12,424 --> 03:11:20,381
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2639
03:11:17,250 --> 03:11:28,312
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?
{\ O (spread)}

2640
03:11:20,381 --> 03:11:28,339
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread)}

2641
03:11:28,312 --> 03:11:39,375
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!
{\ O (spread)}

2642
03:11:28,339 --> 03:11:36,296
You were just that wonderful.

MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...
{\ O (spread)}

2646
03:11:50,437 --> 03:12:01,500
Yeah, I’ll watch too.
{\ O (spread)}

2647
03:11:52,212 --> 03:12:00,169
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—
{\ O (spread)}

2648
03:12:00,169 --> 03:12:08,127
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.
{\ O (spread)}

2649
03:12:01,500 --> 03:12:12,562
Pardon me.
{\ O (rank)}

2650
03:12:08,127 --> 03:12:16,084
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.
{\ O (spread)}

2651
03:12:12,562 --> 03:12:23,625
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!
{\ O (spread)}

2652
03:12:16,084 --> 03:12:24,042
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!
{\ O (spread)}

2657
03:12:34,003 --> 03:10:30,999
Now to everyone at the theatre,
{\ O (spread)}

2658
03:12:34,005 --> 03:10:30,999
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—
