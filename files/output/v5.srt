00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:46,000
{\an8}WARNING

2
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everything’s working.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You have been chosen.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That is why I have to
create this record now.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If something should
happen to me, I—

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Back to the story.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That’s how it looks on the outside.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, listen carefully.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And created our branches around the world...

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And created our branches around the world...

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And created our branches around the world...

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That secret is...

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Stone Mask.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It all began in the 13th century.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
<i>Taken in this hand</i>

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
<i>Taken in this hand</i>

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>The power in this hand</i>

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

59
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,000
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,500
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

61
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

62
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

63
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

64
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

65
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

68
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Wot have we here!

69
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

71
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

73
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

74
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
I said wait!

75
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

76
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Yahoo!

78
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

80
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

81
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

82
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

83
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,940
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

84
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

85
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,420
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

86
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,640
Don’t need that!

87
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,700
Don’t need that!

88
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,700
In the carriage! A baby survived!

89
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,600
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

90
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,900
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

91
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

92
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Nice teeth!

93
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

94
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,300
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

95
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,900
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

96
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,300
You... Did you rescue us...?

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,900
Are my wife and son...?

98
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,220
She croa—

99
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,200
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

100
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,140
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

102
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,840
What about Red?

103
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,480
So this too is fate...

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,380
So this too is fate...

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,180
My name is Joestar...

106
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,060
My name is Joestar...

107
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,260
I will never forget your kindness!

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,300
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,320
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

110
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,980
Dario Brando!

111
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,780
Ah, Dario, beat Brando!

112
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,140
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

113
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,960
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

114
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,520
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

115
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,980
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,820
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

117
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,020
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

118
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,520
{\an8}Their hands were reaching out!

119
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,620
<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride
in our queen, we pierce the horizon)</i>

120
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,500
<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride
in our queen, we pierce the horizon)</i>

121
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,060
<i>(In midnight blue darkness)</i>

122
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,520
{\an8}Those oh-so-familiar voices!

123
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,580
That voice, even

124
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,020
A suspicious voice

125
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,160
<i>Speedwagon’s in da house!</i>

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,360

<i>(Should strife and inequality judge you)</i>

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,280
{\an8}And reach for the heavens!

<i>(Reach out your hand to

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
oh!

171
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
oh!

172
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
oh!

173
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
oh!

174
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

175
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

176
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

177
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

178
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

179
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Oi!

180
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
Oi!

181
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Stop!

182
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Shit—

183
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
Shit—

184
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
C’mon, let’s go!

185
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
C’mon, let’s go!

186
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
C’mon, let’s go!

187
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
C’mon, let’s go!

188
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Nice!

189
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Hey, look at ‘im. Bastard!

190
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740

Don’t let this brat go!

192
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,240
Don’t let this brat go!

193
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,740
Don’t let this brat go!

194
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
Don’t let this brat go!

195
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Oi!

196
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

197
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
He croak or somethin’?

198
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

199
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,740
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

200
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,740
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

201
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,820
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

202
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,280
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

203
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

204
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,200
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

205
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
What is it, Father?

206
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,100
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

207
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
What is it, Father?

208
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,600
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

210
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,300
a

211
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,040
a

212
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

213
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,480
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

214
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,880
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

216
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,140
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

217
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,240
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,080
I’m worried that after I die...

219
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,580
I’m worried that after I die...

220
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,180
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

221
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,500
Oi!

222
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,740
Take this.

223
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,500
Oh, dear dear dear dear

224
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,180
And he owes me one.

225
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
He’s a noble.

226
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
He’s a noble.

227
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,460
And he owes me one.

228
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,260
Okay?

229
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,660
When I die, send him that letter.

230
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,020
Go to him.

231
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,620
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

232
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

233
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,140
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

234
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,100
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

235
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

236
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,340
<i>Now</i> you start acting like a parent?!

237
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,740
Dio!

238
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,900
You’re a smart boy.

239
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,260
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

240
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,900
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Dio

242
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,340
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

243
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,540
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

244
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,780
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

245
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,020
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

246
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,540
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

247
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,740
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

248
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,460
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

249
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,900
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

250
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,500
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

251
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,580
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

252
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,900
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

253
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,260
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

254
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,620
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

255
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,100
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

256
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,220
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

257
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,820
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

258
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,060
openly

259
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,140
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

260
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,140
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

261
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,460
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

262
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,300
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

263
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,980
<i>Is it blue?</i>

264
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,500
<i>Is it blue?</i>

265
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:28,900
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

266
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,940
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

267
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,500
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

268
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,660
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

269
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,940
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

270
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,020
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

271
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,580
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

272
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,140
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

273
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:11,220
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

274
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,380
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

275
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,300
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

276
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,140
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

277
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,620
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

278
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,300
<i>Is the sun shining?</i>

279
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,320
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

280
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,420
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

281
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,700
You’ve got something good today too, eh?

282
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

283
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
My father’s a real doctor!

284
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,300
My father’s a real doctor!

285
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

286
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Stop right there!

287
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,300
What are you doing?! Take this!

288
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
What are you doing?! Take this!

289
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

290
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?

291
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

292
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,300
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

293
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,300
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

294
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

295
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Eh?!

296
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Let’s go already! Shit!

297
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Uh... Are you alright?

298
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
I did this because I wanted to.

299
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I did this because I wanted to.

300
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,300
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.

301
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,300
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

302
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,300
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

303
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

304
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Let’s go, Danny!

305
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Oh, wait!

306
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Ah, wait a minute!

307
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Jona-san Jowstar.

308
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
Okay, let's go!

309
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
You...

310
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
And you’re...

311
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Jonathan Joestar?

312
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

313
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!

314
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

315
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
Danny! What was that for!

316
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Danny! What was that for!

317
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

318
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

319
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Lord Joestar!

320
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

321
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

322
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

323
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Something wrong, JoJo?

324
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

325
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

326
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,300
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

327
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

328
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

329
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

330
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

331
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
-He came at me so suddenly.

332
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
-He came at me so suddenly.

333
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

334
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

335
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

336
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

337
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

338
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,300
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

339
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:03,300
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

340
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Make sure to get along with each other.

341
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,300
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

342
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Nice to have met you!

343
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Nice to have met you!

344
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Ta-ta, JoJo!

345
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
BLADDOG!

346
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
JoJo!

347
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
Don’t touch my bag!

348
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
Don’t touch my bag!

349
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

350
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

351
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

352
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

353
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

354
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
I was only trying to be friendly!

355
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
And one more thing—

356
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
And one more thing—

357
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
I hate dogs.

358
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,300
I hate dogs.

359
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Coming, Lord Joestar!

360
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
I hate dogs.

361
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

362
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

363
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

364
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Thus, the two proofs met and the two players began.

365
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

366
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Dioc.

367
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Okay?

368
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,380
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

369
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,660
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

370
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

371
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

372
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,660
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

373
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

374
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,660
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

375
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,660
It’s just because I love reading so much!

376
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,660
It’s just because I love reading so much!

377
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

378
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
This is the sixth time

379
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,660
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

380
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

381
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

382
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,660
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

383
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

384
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

385
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,660
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

386
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

387
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

388
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,660
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

389
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

390
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

391
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,660
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

392
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

393
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

394
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

395
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

396
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

397
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

398
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,660
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

399
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>

400
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

401
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

402
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

403
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

404
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,660
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

405
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,660
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

406
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,660
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

407
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

408
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Riwo

409
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

410
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
I

411
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

412
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
You

413
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,660
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

414
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Such

415
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,660
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

416
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

417
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

418
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Ikane

419
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

420
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

421
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,660
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

422
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,660
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

423
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

424
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

425
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,660
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

426
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
And so she gave them this condition:

427
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

428
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

429
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

430
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

431
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

432
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

433
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Here is my question for you:

434
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Here is my question for you:

435
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Here is my question for you:

436
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Here is my question for you:

437
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

438
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

439
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

440
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

441
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,660
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

442
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

443
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

444
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,660
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

445
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

446
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

447
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

448
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

449
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

450
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

451
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

452
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

453
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
Or was it the stars shining above them?

454
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,660
What do you think?

455
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
What do you think?

456
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,660
The stars?

457
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Or the mud?

458
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
Or the mud?

459
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Or the mud?

460
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Or

461
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
I...

462
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

463
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

464
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,660
I think they were looking at the mud.

465
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
What’s your reasoning?

466
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
What’s your reasoning?

467
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

468
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Draw?

469
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
I

470
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Draw

471
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

472
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

473
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,

474
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
I think...

475
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
I think...

476
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
They were looking at the stars!

477
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
They were looking at the stars!

478
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
They were looking at the stars!

479
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,660
They were looking at the stars!

480
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

481
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
They held onto their honour!

482
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
So what!

483
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
So what!

484
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
So what!

485
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
So what?

486
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
So what?

487
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

488
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

489
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,660
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

490
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
I

491
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

492
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
But they—

493
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

494
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
But they—

495
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

496
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

497
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

498
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Such regret...

499
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Such powerlessness...

500
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
Such powerlessness...

501
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
What they saw was the mud!

502
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,660
What they saw was the mud!

503
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,660
What they saw was the mud!

504
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,660
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

505
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

506
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!

507
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

508
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Listen!

509
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
解鋼

510
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Listen!

511
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
They

512
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
You’re a noble! You have it all!

513
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

514
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

515
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

516
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

517
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
What

518
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
this

519
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

520
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
That’s enough, you two.

521
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,660
That’s enough, you two.

522
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
That’s enough, you two.

523
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
That’s enough, you two.

524
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,660
That’s enough, you two.

525
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

526
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

527
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
There’s no right answer to this question.

528
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Bear in mind—

529
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
Bear in mind—

530
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

531
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,660
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

532
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,660
What to do

533
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

534
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
I

535
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

538
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

539
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

540
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,660
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

543
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660

00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
Do you want

547
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Or

548
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Which one

549
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,660
Both

550
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,660

What is this move!

624
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,660
I’ve never seen it before!

625

Yay!

My eye!

636
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Guys, guys, guys!

637
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,660
-Hey, hey!

638
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

639
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,660
Teach me!

640
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Guys! Ow...

641
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,360
It was a foul on my part.

642
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,740
Danny...

643
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,220
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

644
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,540
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

645
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,900
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

646
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:36,660
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>

647
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:44,660
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

648
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,660
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

649
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,660
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

650
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:02,660
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

651
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,660
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

652
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,660
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

653
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,660
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

654
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:28,660
You’re...

655
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Is this how you loved me?

656
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,660
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

657
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:57,660
So stop by again!

658
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Hey, what's the flower pressure?

659
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Has it caught your fancy?

660
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,660
It’s alright.

661
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,660
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

662
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,660
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

663
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,660
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

664
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:37,660
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

665
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Are you interested in it?

666
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Oh, no. Not especially.

667
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,660
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

668
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,660
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

669
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,660
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

670
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,660
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

671
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,660
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

672
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,660
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

673
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,660
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

674
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,660
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

675
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,660
There's friendship and trust

676
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,660
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

677
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,660
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.

678
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

679
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

680
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,660
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

681
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

682
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

683
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

684
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

685
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

686
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,660
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

687
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

688
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

689
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Is that so?

690
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

691
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
A young woman

692
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,660
Friends...

693
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,660
The two met once more!

694
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,660
The two met once more!

695
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,660
The two met once more!

696
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

697
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

698
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
ah

699
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

700
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Come boy!

701
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

702
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

703
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

704
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

705
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,660
What are you hiding?

706
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,660
What are you hiding?

707
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,660
I won’t laugh.

708
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I won’t laugh.

709
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Be well behaved

<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>

755
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,660
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

756
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,660
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

It’s already this late!

765
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,660
Erina!

766
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,660
Erina!

00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,660
I’ll see you tomorrow!

768
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Yes, JoJo!

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,660
It's Erina Pendleton.

Today is

790
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
With my superior

791
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
They were just playing

792
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
that

793
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,660
something

794
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
wall

795
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660

He...

798
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
He did it!

799
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Ugh

800
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Ugh

801
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660

You haven’t, have you?

806
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
You haven’t, have you?

807
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
You haven’t, have you?

00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,660
It was me, Dio!

811
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,660
It was me, Dio!

812
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

813
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

814
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,660
You know what this sort of thing

815
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
She’s—!

816

What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

817
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,660
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

818
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,660
My first partner is not Chojo

819
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,660

What’re you sleeping for?

825
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
Mum! Mum!

826
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

827
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

828
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,660
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

829
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,660
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

830

883
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,860
Haa

884
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
<i>Control your emotions, you’re
different from that drunken lout</i>

885
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,860
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

886
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

887
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

888
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

889
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
you

890
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:45,860
<i>I’ll put you back in your place,
I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget</i>

891
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,860
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

892
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,860
<i>I’ll put you back in your place,
I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget</i>

893
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:49,860
nine

894
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,860
Haa

895
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,860
Haa

896
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Come at me!

897
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
<i>This new power arising within me</i>

898
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,860
<i>This new power arising within me</i>

899
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,860
It feels so good!

900
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,860
It feels so good!

901
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,860
It feels so good!

902
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
It feels so good!

903
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,860
Dominate

904
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,860
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

905
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,860
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

906
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,860
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

907
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,860
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

908
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,860
Dio!

909
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

910
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

911
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

912
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

913
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
Haa

914
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

915
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
I miss you

916
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

917
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

918
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

919
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

920
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

921
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,860
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

922
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

923
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

924
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

925
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

926
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

927
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

928
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

929
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,860
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

930
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

931
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

932
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

933
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

934
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,860
Lost

935
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,860
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

936
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,860
Haa

937
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,860
What on earth is going on?!

938
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,860
What on earth is going on?!

939
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,860
What on earth is going on?!

940
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,860
What on earth is going on?!

941
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,860
too

942
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,860
You two! You’ll be punished for this!
Now go back to your rooms!

943
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,860
You two! You’ll be punished for this!
Now go back to your rooms!

944
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,860
surely

945
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,860
Konoha

946
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Better

947
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,860
Like this

948
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Like winning

949
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,860
Cheap

950
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,860
This me

951
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,860
this

952
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Looks good on you

953
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,860
Like this

954
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,860
Dio...

955
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Cheap

956
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

957
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

958
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

959
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,860
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

960
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Ah... Eri—

961
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,860
Ah... Eri—

962
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,860
Ah... Eri—

963
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:24,860
Give a penalty

964
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,860
I feel so miserable!

965
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:27,860
Haa

966
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,860
Haa

967
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,860
Haa

968
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,860
Haa

969
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
Haa

970
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
Erina!

971
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,860
Erina!

972
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,860
Erina!

973
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,860
Haa

974
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,860
Haa

975
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,860
Haa

976
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Haa

977
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
Haa

978
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Haa

979
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Yes, Father.

980
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
Yes, Father.

981
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
Yes, Father.

982
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Yes, Father.

983
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,860
Haa

984
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
Haa

985
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,860
Haa

986
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860
Haa

987
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Haa

988
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,860
Haa

989
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,860
Erina...

990
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,860
Erina...

991
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Erina...

992
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,860
Erina...

993
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Haa

994
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
Haa

995
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
Haa

996
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,860
Haa

997
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
Haa

998
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,860
His resilience...

999
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,860
His resilience...

1000
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,860
I have to become stronger...

1001
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,860
I have to become stronger...

1002
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,860
I have to become stronger...

1003
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,860
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

1004
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

1005
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,860
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

1006
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,860
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

1007
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,360
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

1008
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,360
So that I can take everything from him!

1009
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,360
He looked down on women.

1010
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,360
His explosive power

1011
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,360
I need to develop that mental strength even more.

1012
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,360
However...

1013
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,360
However...

1014
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,360
What’s that noise?

1015
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
But

1016
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
What's that sound?

1017
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,360
Is there anyone in honesty?

1018
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,360
Are you going to try to go outside?

1019
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,360
Oh my god

1020
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Someone please

1021
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
Hmm

1022
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

1023
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

1024
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

1025
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,360
The one excavated from Mexico?

1026
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,360
The one excavated from Mexico?

1027
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
The one excavated from Mexico?

1028
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
It was quite a while ago...

1029
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,360
It was quite a while ago...

1030
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,360
A while?! Could you please clarify?

1031
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,360
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

1032
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,360
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

1033
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

1034
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

1035
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
And bought it from me at a high price—

1036
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,360
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

1037
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

1038
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

1039
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

1040
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,360
Wait a minute!

1041
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

1042
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1043
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1044
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,360
Who the hell are you anyway?

1045
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,360
I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

1046
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

1047
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

1048
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

1049
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,360
All the way from Italy?!

1050
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

1051
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,360
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

1052
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,360
I’ll go check in the books!

1053
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,360
Thank you.

1054
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
Just a little word of warning...

1055
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,360
The sun will be setting soon.

1056
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,360
The sun will be setting soon.

1057
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
Okay

1058
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,360
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

1059
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,360
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

1060
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
in

1061
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

1062
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

1063
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360

00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
It’s true...

1232
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,840
I feel safer at home.

1233
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,840
I feel safer at home.

1234
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,840
I give in.

1235
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Dio is back

1236
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!

1237
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,840
You already know?

1238
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,840
You already know?

1239
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,840
Inspector Archer here told me.

1240
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,840
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...

1241
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,840
Oh no, silly me!

1242
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,840
I truly am proud.

1243
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,840
I have such wonderful sons.

1244
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,840
I have such wonderful sons.

1245
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,840
I have such wonderful sons.

1246
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.

1247
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,840
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.

1248
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,840
But you gave me a chance.

1249
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,840
I was born poor...

1250
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
But you gave me a chance.

1251
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Well then, I’ll be off.

1252
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,840
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

1253
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,840
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.

1254
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:11,840
But this is Liverpool!

1255
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,840
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

1256
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,840
Now, if you’ll pardon me.

1257
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Now, if you’ll pardon me.

1258
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
Especially Dio

1259
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,840
You did really well

1260
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
After the measures

1261
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Be what you want to be

1262
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,840
To me, born of poor origins

1263
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Give it a chance

1264
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,840
thank you

1265
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,840
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

1266
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,840
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

1267
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,840
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

1268
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

1269
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Who on earth made this...

1270
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,840
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

1271
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

1272
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

1273
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,840
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

1274
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
So

1275
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
do

1276
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,840
Thank you again, Master Dio—

1277
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,840
“Right now... I’m sick.”

1278
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,840
“My heart hurts,”

1279
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,840
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

1280
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,840
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

1281
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,840
<i>Dio...</i>

1282
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Also for the shape

1283
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,840
<i>Dio...</i>

1284
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,840
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1285
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,840
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1286
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1287
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1288
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1289
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

1290
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

1291
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
I

1292
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1293
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1294
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1295
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1296
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

1297
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,840
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

1298
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

1299
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

1300
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,840
I don’t bloody need it anymore!

1301
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

1302
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,840
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

1303
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,840
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

1304
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
yes

1305
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,840
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

1306
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

1307
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
Pawn

1308
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,840
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

1309
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,840
yes

1310
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,840
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

1311
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,840
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>

1312
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,840
Zexal

1313
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

1314
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,840
Yes.

1315
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,840
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

1316
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,840
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

1317
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,840
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

1318
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,840
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

1319
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

1320
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

1321
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

1322
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,840
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

1323
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,840
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

1324
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

1325
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

1326
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,840
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

1327
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,840
Stolen

1328
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

1329
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,840
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

1330
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

1331
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

1332
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Flowing

1333
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

1334
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
Zexal

1335
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
white

1336
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,840
This hunt

1337
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
All

1338
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Dio!

1339
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,840
Dio!

1340
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,840
What’s the matter, JoJo?

1341
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,840
What’s the matter, JoJo?

1342
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,840
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

1343
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,840
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.

1344
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
Huh?

1345
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

1346
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,840
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

1347
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,840
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

1348
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

1349
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
What is this non—

1350
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
Answer me!

1351
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
Answer me!

1352
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,840
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

1353
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,840
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

1354
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Then you doubt our very friendship.

1355
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,840
As a gentleman,

1356
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,840
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

1357
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,840
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

1358
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,840
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

1359
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

1360
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Swear on that guy?

1361
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
Swear on that guy?

1362
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Dio,

1363
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Swear on that guy?

1364
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
Swear on it.

1365
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
Swear on it.

1366
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,840
Swear on it.

1367
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,840
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!

1368
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
My

1369
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Give me the medicine back!

1370
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,840
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!

1371
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
You

1372
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
Give me the medicine back!

1373
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
was carrying

1374
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
What

1375
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Start talking

1376
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
Answer me

1377
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
you

1378
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Go

1379
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

1380
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

1381
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
I’m convinced now...

1382
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

1383
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!

1384
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

1385
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

1386
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

1387
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Just a misunderstanding...

1388
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
Just a misunderstanding...

1389
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Besides...

1390
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,840
Besides...

1391
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?

1392
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
地獄

1393
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1394
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1395
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1396
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1397
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1398
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
I

1399
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,840
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

1400
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

1401
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,840
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

1402
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,840
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

1403
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,840
JoJo! JoJo!!

1404
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
JoJo...

1405
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
JoJo...

1406
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
JoJo...

1407
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,840
JoJo...

1408
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840

So this...

1593
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:28,760
So this...

So this...

1597
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,560
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1598
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,640
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1599
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,000
already

1600
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,360
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1601
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,960
I'm excited about you

1602
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,480
So, where is Dio?

1603
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,580
So, where is Dio?

1604
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,300
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1605
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,220
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1606
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,220
Please use the foyer.

1607
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:47,700
Please use the foyer.

1608
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,380
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1609
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:52,660
Yes sir!

1610
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Dio’s father...

1611
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,360
I’ll tell you about it.

1612
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,360
This is certainly my ring,

1613
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,360
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1614
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,360
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1615
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,360
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1616
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,360
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1617
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,360
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1618
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:57,360
I arrested the criminal!

1619
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,360
I arrested the criminal!

1620
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
I arrested the criminal!

1621
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1622
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,360
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1623
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,360
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1624
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,360
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1625
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1626
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,360
Brando?!

1627
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,360
I

1628
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,360
But a thief!

1629
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,360
But a thief!

1630
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,360
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1631
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,360
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1632
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,360
Why?

1633
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
Why?

1634
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Why?

1635
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,360
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1636
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,360
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1637
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,360
Did he tell you...

1638
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,360
But

1639
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Did he tell you...

1640
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,360
Did he tell you...

1641
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
That I gave him this ring?

1642
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1643
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1644
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,360
It’s not a lie.

1645
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
It’s not a lie.

1646
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
This is what I gave him.

1647
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
This is what I gave him.

1648
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,360
This is what I gave him.

1649
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
He is innocent.

1650
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,360
He is innocent.

1651
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,360
This is yours.

1652
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,360
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.

1653
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,360
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.

1654
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,360
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1655
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,360
With this ring, please buy

Would you like to wish me a happy birthday?

1765
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,360
I

1766
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,360
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>

1767
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
still

1768
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,360
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>

1769
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:44,360
You

1770
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,360
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>

1771
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,360
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>

1772
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,360
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1773
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,360
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1774
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,360
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1775
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,360
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1776

<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1779
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:04,360
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”

1780
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:09,360
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1781
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,360
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1782
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,360
Kusabi

1783
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,360
The Stone Mask...

1784
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1785
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,360
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1786
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,360
It was red

1787
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,360
Full of passion

1788
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:33,360
I, Dio, was...

1789
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,360
Shit...

1790
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,360
Shit...

1791
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,360
My beloved father

1792
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,360
I see you’ve returned from London—

1793
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,360
I have the antidote now.

1794
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
I have the antidote now.

1795
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,360
From this hand

1796
01:21:56,360 --> 01:22:00,360
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1797
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,360
It truly hurts me.

1798
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,360
Although you might not believe me,

1799
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Those are my true feelings.

1800
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:14,360
Those are my true feelings.

1801
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,360
You’re honest like that.

1802
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:24,360
You’re honest like that.

1803
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,360
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1804
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,360
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1805
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,360
The final one
I will ask of you.

1806
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,360
I...

1807
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,360
Because I was born into squalor...

1808
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,360
My ambition was relentless.

1809
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:12,360
I want to repent for my sins!

1810
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,360
Don’t believe a word he says!

1811
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,360
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1812
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1813
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,360
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1814
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,360
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1815
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,360
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.

1816
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:48,360
Worse than vomit!

1817
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,360
He was born evil!

1818
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,360
This man has confessed already.

1819
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,360
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1820
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,360
I will return to my bed to rest.

1821
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,360
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1822
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,360
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1823
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,360
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1824
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,360
He was born with an innate destiny.

1825
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,360
Come on—

1826
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,360
JoJo, I understand!

1827
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,360
Arrest me.

1828
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,360
Arrest me.

1829
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,360
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1830
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,360
I am

1831
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,360
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1832
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,360
I will handcuff you.

1833
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,360
I will handcuff you.

1834
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,360
I've seen a lot of different people

1835
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,360
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1836
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:13,360
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1837
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,360
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1838
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,360
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1839
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,360
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1840
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,360
or

1841
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,360
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1842
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,360
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1843
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:46,360
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1844
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,360
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1845
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,360
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>

1846
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,360
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1847
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,360
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1848
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,360
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1849
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,360
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1850
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,360
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1851
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,360
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1852
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,360
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1853
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,360
<i>The stars!</i>

1854
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,360

This is...

Your late mother’s ring.

1874
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,360
Your late mother’s ring.

Your late mother’s ring.

Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:29,140
H-He’s sucking his blood!

1941
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:35,140
I'm sad about this fate

1942
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:41,140
You’re—

1943
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,140
From the Stone Mask...

1944
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,140
From your father’s blood!

1945
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,140
From the Stone Mask...

1946
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:59,140
From your father’s blood!

1947
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,140
From your father’s blood!

1948
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,140
From your father’s blood!

1949
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:04,140
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1950
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,140
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1951
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:07,140
That monster is too bloody strong!

1952
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:18,140
The brain!

1953
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,140
If that’s the case...

1954
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:21,140
If that’s the case...

1955
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:23,140
If that’s the case...

1956
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,140
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!

1957
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,140
Utero

1958
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,140
Don't be silly

1959
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,140
It's early

1960
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,140
I don't know above

1961
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
I must...

1962
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:48,140
I must...

1963
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:54,140
I must make my will stronger!

1964
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:58,140
Suddenly puffed up...

1965
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:05,140
JoJo!

1966
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:13,140
Weak! So weak!

1967
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:23,140
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1968
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:27,140
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1969
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:34,140
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1970
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,140
A quick fix to the running.

1971
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:39,140
JoJo...

1972
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:41,140
That running thing appears.

1973
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:48,140
I told you, didn’t I?

1974
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:52,140
I told you, didn’t I?

1975
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:53,140
Humans have limits!

1976
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,140
Humans have limits!

1977
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:09,140
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1978
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:10,140
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1979
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:14,380
Already

1980
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,400
It’s courage!

1981
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,740
Crab Cui Crab Cui

1982
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:46,040
a!

1983
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:49,960
<i>Come, Dio.</i>

1984
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:56,780
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1985
01:35:56,780 --> 01:36:03,280
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1986
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:13,100
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>

1987
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:18,140
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1988
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,140
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1989
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:25,140
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1990
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,140
{\an8}<i>(Flickering from light to dark)</i>

1991
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:37,140
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1992
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,140
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1993
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:44,140
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1994
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:51,140
<i>It’s time for us to say goodbye to it</i>

1995
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,140
<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

1996
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1997
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,140
<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

1998
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,140
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1999
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:02,140
<i>I’ve lost everything, save for my life</i>

2000
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,140
<i>I’ve lost everything, save for my life</i>

2001
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,140
ah

2002
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:20,140
Run in the dark

2003
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,140
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

2004
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,140
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

2005
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,140
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

2006
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:30,140
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

2007
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:34,140
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

2008
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:39,140
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

2009
01:37:40,140 --> 01:37:42,140
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

2010
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,140
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

2011
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,140
It's useless, it's useless

2012
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:52,140
If you suck that life out

2013
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:55,140
This flickering

2014
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,140
Not from afar

2015
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:01,140
Let's give one

2016
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:06,140
Give me your strength

2017
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,140
From now on, always

2018
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,140
From your back

2019
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,140
On my back,

2020
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:15,140
This body is immortal.

2021
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,140
This body is immortal.

2022
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,140
The only one dying will be you!

2023
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:22,140
The only one dying will be you!

2024
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,140
Women

2025
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,140

<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

2034
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:43,140
The knife you stabbed Father with!

<i>(The goddess of familial love

2036
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140

It's your fault, I almost fell into the basement

2070
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,140
Where do you approach? I've grown fond of you

2071
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:14,140
Can you hear me?

2072

Can you hear me?

You can hear me.

You can hear me.

2075
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:29,140
I hope you had a nice intermission.

2076
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:33,140
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,

2077
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:36,140
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

2078
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:41,140
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

2079
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:45,140
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

2080
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:30,140
Yes.

2081
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:35,140
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.

But Mr. Joestar survived.

2083
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:43,140
But lost everything.

2084
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:46,140
But lost everything.

2085
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:51,140
But lost everything.

2086
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:55,140
Can you hear me?

2087
01:41:55,140 --> 01:42:00,140
I can hear you

2088
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:06,140
I mentioned the Astika people before.

2089
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:14,140
The mask that man wore!

2090
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:18,140

I’m not much,

After carrying the unconscious Mr. Joestar
to the hospital, I came back to visit him!

2097
01:42:57,140 --> 01:43:01,140
Can I help you?

2098
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:05,140
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

2099

You’re—

2116
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:37,140
Like Erina Pendleton?

2117
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:41,140
Like Erina Pendleton?

2118
01:44:41,140 --> 01:44:45,140
How?

01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:49,140
How?

2120
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:53,140
It’s really been too long.

2121
01:44:53,140 --> 01:45:03,140
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

2122
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:08,140
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

2123
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:11,140
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

2124
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:17,140
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

2125
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:21,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2126
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2127
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:25,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2128
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:27,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2129
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:29,140
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

2130
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:54,140
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

2131
01:45:54,140 --> 01:46:03,140
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

2132
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:07,140
<i>I can see it there</i>

2133
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:13,140
<i>I can see it there</i>

2134
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:17,140
<i>Your hand</i>

2135
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:28,140
I

2136
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:33,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2137
01:46:33,140 --> 01:46:35,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2138
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:37,140
Please stay calm now

2139
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:40,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2140
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:43,140
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

2141
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:47,140
<i>Drawn together on that fleeting day</i>

2142
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:52,140
<i>Just the two of us</i>

2143
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,140
<i>Just the two of us</i>

2144
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:57,140
Fate? That’s right.

2145
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,140
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

2146
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,140
Fate? That’s right.

2147
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,140
Why

2148
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:06,140
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

2149
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,140
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

2150
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:11,140
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

2151
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:14,140
It's really been a while

2152
01:47:14,140 --> 01:47:17,140
I was weak

2153
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:22,140
It wasn't my first time with you

2154
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:25,140
It was me who was young

2155
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:30,140
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

2156
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:34,140
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

2157
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:38,140
<i>Her throat was slit</i>

2158
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:42,140
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

2159
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:46,140
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

2160
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:50,140
<i>The utmost cruelty!</i>

2161
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:54,140
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

2162
01:47:54,140 --> 01:48:02,140
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

2163
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:09,140
Elina

2164
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:10,140
sorry

2165
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:13,140
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

2166
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:16,140
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

2167
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:19,140
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

2168
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:23,140
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

2169
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:27,140
<i>Jack the Ripper!</i>

2170
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:30,140
You’re kidding!

2171
01:48:30,140 --> 01:48:35,140
I have to return home soon...

2172
01:48:35,140 --> 01:48:39,140
I have to return home soon...

2173
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:43,140
It’s a terrifying thought!

2174
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:47,140
Terrifying, is it?

2175
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:51,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2176
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:56,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2177
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,140
You’re talking with him right now!

2178
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:02,140
attract

2179
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:05,140
fit

2180
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,140
You’re out playing too late,

2181
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:13,140
You’re out playing too late,

2182
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:17,140
You dirty harlot!

2183
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,140
yes

2184
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:21,140
Who goes there?

2185
01:49:21,140 --> 01:49:25,140
Who goes there?

2186
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,140
I like you.

2187
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,140
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

2188
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:41,140
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

2189
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:44,140
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

2190
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:47,140
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2191
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,140
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2192
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:51,140
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2193
01:49:51,140 --> 01:49:53,140
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

2194
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,140
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

2195
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:57,140
<i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>

2196
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:01,140
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

2197
01:50:01,140 --> 01:50:05,140
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

2198
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:11,740
Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

2199
01:50:11,740 --> 01:50:19,340
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

2200
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:22,840
How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?

2201
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:29,840
What do you know about me?!

2202
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:33,200
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

2203
01:50:33,220 --> 01:50:35,480
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

2204
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:39,740
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

2205
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:43,440
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

2206
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:46,520
{\an8}<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

2207
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,300
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

2208
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:52,600
That’s right!

2209
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,800
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

2210
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,300
<i>I’m not scared of anything!</i>

2211
01:50:58,300 --> 01:51:02,300
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

2212
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:05,300
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

2213
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:08,300
<i>Come to my side, Jack the Ripper!</i>

2214
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:15,300
<i>Who are you?</i>

2215
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:19,300
<i>Who are you?</i>

2216
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:32,300
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

2217
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:37,300
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

2218
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,300
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

2219
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,300
you

2220
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,300
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2221
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:54,300
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2222
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:01,300
I don't feel any pain

2223
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,300
There's no more of that

2224
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,300
Reborn now

2225
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:09,300
Let's start my life

2226
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:12,300
I have to heal my ache

2227
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,300
I need life

2228
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:17,300
So I feel less fulfilled

2229
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:21,300
Don't you want power?

2230
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:23,300
The Stone Mask...

2231
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,300
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

2232
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:33,300
It has to have been.

2233
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,300
It has to have been.

2234
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,300
It’s alright.

2235
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:38,300
It’s alright.

2236
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,300
It’s alright.

2237
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,300
Let’s go.

2238
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:43,300
Let’s go.

2239
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,300
How about it?

2240
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,300
What’s wrong?

2241
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:47,300
What’s wrong?

2242
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,300
What’s wrong?

2243
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:52,300
Jonathan Joestar!

2244
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:54,300
Has he been here
this whole time?

2245
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,300
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

2246
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,300
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

2247
01:52:58,300 --> 01:52:59,300
Such

2248
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:01,300
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

2249
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,300
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

2250
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,300
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

2251
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:07,300
The Stone Mask?!

2252
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,300
The Stone Mask?!

2253
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,300
It seems like it will change

2254
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:10,300
There's already one

2255
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,300
Yes.

2256
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:13,300
Well then

2257
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,300
<i>Squeeze out</i>

2258
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:18,300
<i>Every last ounce</i>

2259
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:19,300
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

2260
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:21,300
<i>Every last ounce</i>

2261
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:22,300
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

2262
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:25,300
How could you, he’s injured!

2263
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,300
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

2264
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:29,300
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

2265
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,300
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

2266
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:31,300
Jack

<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

2273
01:53:43,300 --> 01:53:45,300
<i>I manipulated your breath, your
breath made the pain go away</i>

2274
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,300
<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

2275
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,300
What did you do to me?!

2276
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:52,300
What did you do to me?!

2277
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,300
How do you know my name!

2278
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,300
How do you know my name!

2279
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:56,300
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

2280
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,300
<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

2283
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:03,300
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

2284
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,300
<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>

2285
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:07,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2286
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:09,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2287
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:16,300
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

2288
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:21,300
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

2289
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:32,300
<i>Let me demonstrate for you</i>

2290
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,300
became

<i>(In, out!)</i>

2293

It does things like carry nutrients

It does things like carry nutrients

2312
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:37,300
The power of the ripple gathers that small

That turns humans into vampires.

01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,300
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

2360
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:33,300
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

2361
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,300
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

2362
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,300
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

Ah, let’s put it this way.

Ah, let’s put it this way.

2365
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,300
Ah, let’s put it this way.

2366
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:47,300
What must you do to stop that ripple?

2367
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:49,300
What must you do to stop that ripple?

2368
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:51,300
I think I’ve got it!

I think I’ve got it!

2370
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:57,460
Use a ripple!

2371
01:57:57,460 --> 01:57:59,660
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

2372
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:01,780
And that wave of energy

2373
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:05,700
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

2374
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:06,980
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

2375
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:08,740
The power to defeat Dio!

2376
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:16,220
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

2377

You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

2378
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:19,860
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

2379
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:22,060
What do you mean, Dio?

2380
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:23,220
What do you mean, Dio?

2381
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:27,180
I can’t get you involved in this!

2382
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:31,300
For now, please just go along with it!

2383

For now, please just go along with it!

01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,980
How...?

2385
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:39,860
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

2386
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,860
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

2387
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:44,220
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

2388
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,540
If you don't destroy it

2389
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:48,540
In the hands of destruction

2390
01:58:48,540 --> 01:58:50,340
Well, is there any more?

2391

Tattered and worn

2396
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,980
Do you accept it?

02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:21,660
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

2471
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,660
Mr. Joestar!

2472
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,660
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

2473
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,660
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

2474
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:31,660
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

2475
02:03:39,660 --> 02:03:41,660
He’s strong enough to rival you.

2476
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,660
He’s strong enough to rival you.

2477
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,660
What was that, you old fart?

2478
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:49,660
Let's continue to exist

2479
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,660
Your everything

2480
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:55,660
Acceptance

2481
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:59,660
His arm... got longer!

2482
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:01,660
yes

2483
02:04:01,660 --> 02:04:05,660
His arm... got longer!

2484
02:04:05,660 --> 02:04:09,660
The stars

2485
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:11,660
Daylight

2486
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:13,660
Your

2487
02:04:13,660 --> 02:04:17,660
Don't let your destiny lead you

Daylight

2490
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:25,660
It’s useless.

2491
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:27,660
I’ve been given new life!

2492
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:29,660
I

2493
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,660
Me

2494
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:37,660
That’s not what’s important here.

2495
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:43,660
M-My body...

2496
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,660
It’s hot!

2497
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,660
Go

2498
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:07,660
Kiev

2499
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:09,660
I lost so much...

2500
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,660
Going

2501
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:13,660
I lost so much...

2502
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:15,660
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

2503
02:05:15,660 --> 02:05:16,660
Go

But it’s the same power!

2509
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:27,420
Wihaha

“The north wind created the brave vikings!”

2516
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:37,080
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

2517
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:41,300
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

2518
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,260
They became vikings with backbone!

2519
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,200
Because you feel the pain.

2520
02:05:46,660 --> 02:05:49,960
Because you feel the pain.

2521
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:51,160

<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:05,480
You need to listen to that pain!

What you need is the courage

And the resolve to face the consequences.

02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,400

Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,400
Are you angry?

2598
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,400
You’re good company, huh?

2599
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,400
Oh! It burns! It burns!

2600
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:06,400
Oh! It burns! It burns!

2601
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,400
Is that Mr. Horse?

2602

Is that Mr. Horse?

<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>

2612
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,400
<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>

2621
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,400
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.

2622
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,400
and

2623
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:17,400
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

2624
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:20,400
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

2625
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:22,400
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

2626
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,400
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

2627
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,400
Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.

2628
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,400
Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?

2629
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,400
Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.

2630
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:59,400
What is he...

2631
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:05,400
I

2632
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:14,180
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!

2633
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:26,920
Surprise fall

2634
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,740
It's a horse

2635
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:34,460
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!

2636
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:35,640
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

2637
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:37,620
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

2638
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:39,180
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

2639
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:39,960
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

2640
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:41,800
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

2641
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,100
What are you yammering on about!

2642
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:45,560
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

2643
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:47,500
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

2644
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:48,660
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

2645
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:49,860
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

2646
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,380
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

2647
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:52,100
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!

2648
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:52,900
The ripple breathing technique

The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

2651
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,140
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

2652
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:00,400
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

2653
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:01,260
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

2654
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:03,260
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

2655
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:05,260
They’re just like fleas!

2656
02:13:05,260 --> 02:13:07,260
Hot, so hot!

2657

Yes... I’ll eat every

Windknight’s Lot...

2664
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,260
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

2665
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,260
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

2666
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:35,260
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

2667
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:37,260
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

2668
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,260
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

2669
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,260
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

2670

Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

2671
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,260
This is the entrance to the city.

2672
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:45,260
The projection area is as planned.

2673
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:48,260
Hey! Win the race!

2674
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:50,260
Why stop place

2675
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:55,260
Be careful

2676
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,260
Dio doesn't have a strong hand here.

2677
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:03,260
Look!

2678
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:20,260

02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,460
I am able to control my own body at will.

2817
02:21:58,460 --> 02:21:59,200
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2818
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,040
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2819
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:01,960
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2820
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:02,960
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2821
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:03,960
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2822
02:22:03,960 --> 02:22:05,240
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2823
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:07,840
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2824
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,640
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2825
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:11,960
Mr. Zeppeli!

2826
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:13,960
Useless, useless, useless, useless!

2827
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:14,960
soon

2828
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:16,960
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2829
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:19,660
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2830
02:22:19,660 --> 02:22:22,160
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,

2831
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:25,140
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,

2832
02:22:25,140 --> 02:22:27,340
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2833
02:22:27,340 --> 02:22:31,520
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2834
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:38,420
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.

2835
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,660
Grz

2836
02:22:41,900 --> 02:22:44,540
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...

2837
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:47,420
That’s right. Do you remember?

2838
02:22:47,420 --> 02:22:50,420
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?

2839
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:56,420
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2840
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:57,420
a?

2841
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,420
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2842
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:00,420
But

2843
02:23:00,420 --> 02:23:02,420
Mary Stuart!

2844
02:23:02,420 --> 02:23:04,420
Mary Stuart!

2845
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,420
It was about the ones who served her!

2846
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:09,420
It was about the ones who served her!

2847
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:12,420
Father told us...

2848
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:21,420
Father told us...

2849
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:28,420
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2850
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:32,420
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2851
02:23:32,420 --> 02:23:39,420
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

2852
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:44,420
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2853
02:23:48,420 --> 02:23:57,420
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2854
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:06,420
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>

2855
02:24:08,420 --> 02:24:10,420
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2856
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:12,420
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2857
02:24:12,420 --> 02:24:16,420
品積品積!

2858
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:23,420
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>

2859
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:28,420
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>

2860
02:24:28,420 --> 02:24:35,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2861
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:38,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2862
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:40,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2863
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:46,420
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2864
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,420
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2865
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2866
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:57,420
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>

2867
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:02,580
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2868
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:12,180
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2869
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:14,420
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2870
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:16,420
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2871
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:25,420
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2872
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:29,020
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2873
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:34,040
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2874
02:25:34,040 --> 02:25:38,180
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2875
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:40,620
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2876
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:42,500
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2877
02:25:42,500 --> 02:25:45,420
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2878
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:46,620
Dad's

2879
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:48,220
Now

2880
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:53,020
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2881
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:55,620
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2882
02:25:55,620 --> 02:25:58,140
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2883
02:25:58,140 --> 02:26:01,740
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2884
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:04,540
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2885
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:05,500
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2886
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:09,940
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2887
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:14,420
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2888
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:18,900
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2889
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:23,460
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2890
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:27,940
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2891
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:32,460
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2892
02:26:32,460 --> 02:26:35,940
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2893
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:39,140
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2894
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:41,060
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2895
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:45,140
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2896
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:47,540
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2897
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:49,940
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2898
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:54,740
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2899
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:57,140
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2900
02:26:57,140 --> 02:26:59,340
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2901
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:03,740
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2902
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:06,020
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2903
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:08,340
Everything is connected!

2904
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:13,140
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2905
02:27:13,140 --> 02:27:14,340
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2906
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:16,340
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2907
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:17,460
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2908
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:19,540
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2909
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:21,940
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2910
02:27:21,940 --> 02:27:26,340
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2911
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:30,940
<i>Either one—</i>

2912
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:35,340
<i>Either one—</i>

2913
02:27:35,340 --> 02:27:39,940
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2914
02:27:39,940 --> 02:27:44,340
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2915
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:51,140
I turned those two

2916
02:27:51,140 --> 02:27:53,440
I turned those two

2917
02:27:53,440 --> 02:27:57,140
I turned those two

2918
02:27:57,140 --> 02:28:02,140
Even history bends before me!

2919
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:07,540
Even history bends before me!

2920
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:09,540
It can’t be!

2921
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,940
I'll scoop up the maid

2922
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:14,540
Such grotesque forms!

2923
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:16,940
Such grotesque forms!

2924
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:20,340
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2925
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:21,740
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2926
02:28:21,740 --> 02:28:24,740
Don’t you think so?

2927
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:29,340
Wow

2928
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:33,040
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2929
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:38,440
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2930
02:28:38,440 --> 02:28:43,040
Our pride!

2931
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,340
And you, Tarkus!

2932
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:47,440
The way you feel—

2933
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:51,440
Your pride, your resentment.

2934
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:54,140
Your pride, your resentment.

2935
02:28:54,140 --> 02:28:56,440
I can’t even imagine it!

2936
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:59,840
But I also bear my own burdens!

2937
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:10,840
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2938
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:18,840
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2939
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:20,840
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2940
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:22,540
Alright, go ahead!

2941
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:25,140
We’ll duel as knights!

2942
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:27,840
We’ll duel as knights!

2943
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:29,840
Run away, you two!

2944
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:31,540
Run away, you two!

2945
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:33,740
Mr. Joestar!

2946
02:29:33,740 --> 02:29:36,440
I won’t let you interfere!

2947
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:38,640
I won’t let you interfere!

2948
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:41,140
I won’t let you interfere!

2949
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:43,840
I want to believe

2950
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:46,240
People are like destiny

2951
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:52,840
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2952
02:29:52,840 --> 02:29:55,040
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2953
02:29:55,040 --> 02:30:04,640
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2954
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:08,040
Gradually

2955
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:14,040
Don’t come any closer!

2956
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:25,040
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2957
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:32,040
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2958
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:38,040
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2959
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:40,040
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2960
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:50,040
Honourable knight,

2961
02:30:50,040 --> 02:30:53,040
Honourable knight,

2962
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:56,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2963
02:30:56,040 --> 02:30:59,040
Is that what you take pride in?

2964
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:03,040
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2965
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,040
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2966
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:08,040
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2967
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:10,040
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2968
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:12,040
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2969
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:15,040
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2970
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,040
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2971
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:19,040
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2972
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,040
Old man!

2973
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:22,040
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2974
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:25,040
Old man!

2975
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:28,040
Melt!

2976
02:31:28,040 --> 02:31:31,040
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2977
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:34,040
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2978
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:39,040
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2979
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,040
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2980
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,040
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2981
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:44,040
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2982
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:48,040
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2983
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:51,040
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2984
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,040
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2985
02:31:58,040 --> 02:31:59,040
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2986
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:02,040
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2987
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:06,040
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2988
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:23,040
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2989
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,040
Let it somehow be restored!

2990
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,040
Let it somehow be restored!

2991
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:28,040
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2992
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:31,040
This pain means nothing to me!

2993
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:32,040
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2994
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:34,040
This pain means nothing to me!

2995
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,040
Osa

2996
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:40,040
Why aren’t you moving?

2997
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:49,040
Just now,

2998
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:53,040
You said “pain”.

2999
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:55,040
That means that now,

3000
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,040
You can feel pain!

3001
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Pain?

3002
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:00,040
Pain?

3003
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:01,040
Don't mess with me

3004
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:03,040
Even at a time like this

3005
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,040
That’s why...

3006
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,040
Come

3007
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,040
That’s why...

3008
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,040
I stopped fighting you.

3009
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,040
I stopped fighting you.

3010
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:10,040
I stopped fighting you.

3011
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:12,040
I stopped fighting you.

3012
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:15,040
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3013
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,040
Remember

3014
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,040
You are a great knight.

3015
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
You are a great knight.

3016
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:24,040
You are human!

3017
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:25,040
You are human!

3018
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:27,040
Pain...

3019
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,040
Pain...

3020
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:29,040
Is proof of life!

3021
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,040
Is proof of life!

3022
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:32,040
Is proof of life!

3023
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:34,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3024
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:36,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3025
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,040
So this is what it means to be human?

3026
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:39,040
already

3027
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:41,040
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3028
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:42,040
regain

3029
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:44,040
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3030
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:45,040
Tomorrow

3031
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:46,040
Tomorrow

3032
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:48,040
Now

3033
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:51,040
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3034
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:55,020
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3035
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:57,040
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3036
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:58,040
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3037
02:33:58,040 --> 02:33:59,040
When

3038
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,040
Bruford...

3039
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:07,040
Luck!

3040
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:11,040
And also...

3041
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:12,360
Pluck!

3042
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,360
Don't wait for tomorrow

3043
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:18,360
Pluck!

3044
02:34:18,360 --> 02:34:22,360
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

3045
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:26,360
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

3046
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:32,360
JoJo!

3047
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:34,360
girl

3048
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:40,360
JoJo!

3049
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:46,360
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

3050
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:49,360
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

3051
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:51,360
Just as I thought...

3052
02:34:51,360 --> 02:34:53,460
I, Dio, will—

3053
02:34:56,360 --> 02:34:59,360
I, Dio, will—

3054
02:34:59,360 --> 02:35:02,360
Hey baby!

3055
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:10,360
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3056
02:35:10,360 --> 02:35:12,360
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3057
02:35:14,360 --> 02:35:16,360
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3058
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:19,360
pain

3059
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:25,360
What an embarrassment of a knight!

3060
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:29,360
He never got his revenge!

3061
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:34,360
He never got his revenge!

3062
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:36,360
What did he have to be joyful about!

3063
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:39,360
What I saw

3064
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:43,360
Sennorakashi

3065
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:48,360
How could you!

3066
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:51,360
How could you!

3067
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,360
For victory!

3068
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:57,360
For victory!

3069
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:07,360
I’ll get you!

3070
02:36:08,360 --> 02:36:10,360
I’ll get you for this!

3071
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:12,360
JoJo!

3072
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:17,360
My... dying wish is...

3073
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:23,360
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3074
02:36:25,360 --> 02:36:26,360
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3075
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:28,360
Let's go

3076
02:36:38,360 --> 02:36:40,360
He collapsed.

3077
02:36:42,360 --> 02:36:44,360
He collapsed.

3078
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:47,360
Come

3079
02:36:48,360 --> 02:36:51,360
Affection

3080
02:36:54,360 --> 02:36:56,360
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

3081
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:01,360
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

3082
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,360
To think he would defeat Kurokiko

3083
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:09,360
Old man!

3084
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:12,360
Old man!

3085
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:19,360
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

3086
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:22,360
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

3087
02:37:23,360 --> 02:37:24,360
I lived my own life to the fullest.

3088
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:32,360
In the end,

3089
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:38,360
You are my hope.

3090
02:37:38,360 --> 02:37:41,360
At the beginning of the season

3091
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:53,360
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

3092
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:56,960
Loss of motivation and enthusiasm

3093
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:06,380
驚

3094
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:12,360
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

3095
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:18,860
From now on

3096
02:38:20,860 --> 02:38:24,860
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

3097
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:28,860
<i>Into my spirit</i>

3098
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:36,860
JoJo

3099
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:46,360
From here on...

3100
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:48,360
<i>Everything is connected</i>

3101
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:51,360
JoJo!

3102
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:12,360
Wow

3103
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:16,060
always

3104
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:18,360
<i>Even this pain</i>

3105
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:23,360
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3106
02:39:23,360 --> 02:39:28,360
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3107
02:39:28,360 --> 02:39:31,360
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3108
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:34,360
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

3109
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:36,240
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

3110
02:39:36,240 --> 02:40:06,040
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

3111
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:14,240
<i>I see the stars</i>

3112
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:29,240
<i>The way to you...</i>

3113
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:53,240
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

3114
02:40:54,240 --> 02:41:13,240
The light that was received would seep in. In my heart, I felt as if I was both dead and breathing at the same time.

3115
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:20,240
From now on, I'm coming into you. Thank you very much.

3116
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:35,240
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

3117
02:41:35,240 --> 02:41:52,240
<i>You and I are different</i>

3118
02:41:53,240 --> 02:42:03,240
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

3119
02:42:05,240 --> 02:42:15,240
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

3120
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:27,240
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

3121
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:36,240
<i>What do I want?</i>

3122
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:42,240
<i>I want...</i>

3123
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:54,240
So you’ve come...

3124
02:42:55,240 --> 02:43:05,240
The world you wished for?

3125
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:11,240
What?

3126
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:40,240
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

3127
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:59,240
You’re just afraid.

3128
02:43:59,240 --> 02:44:05,240
Of being human...

3129
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:11,240
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

3130
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:15,240
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

3131
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:19,240
You ran away from it.

3132
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:23,240
It's my fault.

3133
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:28,240
That changed until

3134
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:32,240
The ends justify the means.

3135
02:44:32,240 --> 02:44:36,240
The ends justify the means.

3136
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:39,240
I will win,

3137
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:42,240
All of this is fate!

3138
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:48,240
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

3139
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:51,240
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

3140
02:44:51,240 --> 02:44:54,240
What will your legacy be?

3141
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:58,240
What will your legacy be?

3142
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,240
Such righteousness!

3143
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:01,240
Such righteousness!

3144
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:02,240
Such righteousness!

3145
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:06,240
Such righteousness!

3146
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:14,240
And then died!

3147
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:23,240
Just like...

3148
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:30,240
Your father.

3149
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:34,240
That’s right.

3150
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:39,240
That’s right.

3151
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:44,240
what,

3152
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:51,240
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

3153
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:55,240
For the sake of revenge...

3154
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:03,240
I will kill you!

3155
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,240
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

3156
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:10,240
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

3157
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:13,240
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

3158
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:22,240
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

3159
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,240
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

3160
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:31,240
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

3161
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:34,240
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

3162
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:41,240
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

3163
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:46,240
<i>I obtained this power</i>

3164
02:46:54,240 --> 02:46:57,240
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

3165
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:02,240
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

3166
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:07,240
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

3167
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:11,240
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

3168
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:12,240
But

3169

<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

You did it! You defeated Dio!

3171
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:25,240
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3172
02:47:25,240 --> 02:47:27,240
Not a chance!

3173
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:35,240
Utterly pathetic!

3174
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:39,240
Give me strength

3175
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,240
dead

3176
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:53,240

<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

3178
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:06,240
My fist... Just from hitting him!

3179
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:15,240
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

3180
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:19,240
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

3182
02:48:25,240 --> 02:48:26,740

<i>DIO: I’ll chip away at this body to prove it

JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

3189
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:43,320
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

3190
02:48:43,580 --> 02:48:46,540
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3191
02:48:46,600 --> 02:48:48,840

3198
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:07,560

pain

3200
02:49:08,820 --> 02:49:10,720
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:18,220
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

3202
02:49:18,220 --> 02:49:24,720
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

3203
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:29,520
<i>I won’t stop beating you

The heat is coursing through me!

3207
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:49,520
This is impossible!

3208
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:54,520
I can’t be...

3209
02:49:55,020 --> 02:50:01,840
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

緊弱緊弱

3211

Lord Dio...!

3212
02:50:09,020 --> 02:50:14,020
It's so tense, but it's actually deceiving you

3213
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:15,220
Dio...!

3214
02:50:15,220 --> 02:50:21,020
Now you too will come to me, and death will resonate with you

3215
02:50:21,020 --> 02:50:27,620

I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

3299

I used to despise you so much,

3300
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:04,660
I used to despise you so much,

But now I respect you...

3302
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:08,660
That’s because I’ve realised something!

3303

That’s because I’ve realised something!

3304
02:54:10,660 --> 02:54:12,660
If there is a God that controls fate,

If there is a God that controls fate,

orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

3315
02:54:28,660 --> 02:54:29,660
The world has slipped from my grasp!

3316
02:54:29,660 --> 02:54:31,660
And you’re the reason why...

3317
02:54:31,660 --> 02:54:33,660
When will it...

3318
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:34,660
When will it...

I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.

<i>With my final ripple!</i>

3341
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:33,660
<i>JoJo!</i>

3342
02:56:33,660 --> 02:56:36,660
Because I realized that

3343
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:41,660
<i>I felt it tear. Something
important inside me just tore</i>

3344
02:56:41,660 --> 02:56:46,660
<i>I felt it tear. Something
important inside me just tore</i>

3345
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:51,660
ERINA: How could this be?!
JOJO: Get out of here!

3346
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:55,660
ERINA: How could this be?!
JOJO: Get out of here!

3347
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:59,660
I won’t, JoJo...

3348
02:56:59,660 --> 02:57:01,660
<i>I will burn with you</i>

3349
02:57:01,660 --> 02:57:05,660
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

3350
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:12,660
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

3351
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:16,660
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

3352
02:57:17,660 --> 02:57:19,660
JoJo

3353
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:22,660
<i>Everything is connected</i>

3354
02:57:22,660 --> 02:57:26,660
<i>There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

3355
02:57:28,660 --> 02:57:34,660
<i>The one to spin the thread of fate</i>

3356
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:41,660
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

3357
02:57:41,660 --> 02:57:43,660
<i>I’m still alive! </i>

3358
02:57:43,660 --> 02:57:46,660
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

3359
02:57:46,660 --> 02:57:48,660
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

3360
02:57:48,660 --> 02:57:50,660
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

3361
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:55,660
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

3362
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:57,660
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

3363
02:57:57,660 --> 02:57:59,660
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

3364
02:57:59,660 --> 02:58:03,660
<i>JoJo!</i>

3365
02:58:03,660 --> 02:58:05,660
If you do that

3366
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:08,660
I know what you’re like...

3367
02:58:09,660 --> 02:58:11,660
I figured...

3368
02:58:11,660 --> 02:58:12,660
You would strike...

3369
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:14,660
You would strike...

3370
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:15,660
You would strike...

3371
02:58:15,660 --> 02:58:16,660
Before I...

3372
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:17,660
All people

3373
02:58:17,660 --> 02:58:18,660
Before I...

3374
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:20,660
Lost consciousness.

3375
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:21,660
Lost consciousness.

3376
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:22,660
Lost consciousness.

3377
02:58:22,660 --> 02:58:23,660
That neck

3378
02:58:23,660 --> 02:58:24,660
JoJo?

3379
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:25,660
Inaccuracy

3380
02:58:25,660 --> 02:58:26,660
JoJo?

3381
02:58:26,660 --> 02:58:27,660
Let me go, JoJo!

3382
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:28,660
Let me go, JoJo!

3383
02:58:28,660 --> 02:58:30,660
You

3384
02:58:30,660 --> 02:58:34,660
He’s...

3385
02:58:34,660 --> 02:58:35,660
My

3386
02:58:35,660 --> 02:58:37,660
Dead...

3387
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:39,660
Dead...

3388
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:42,660
This child

3389
02:58:42,660 --> 02:58:44,660
Someone

3390
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:45,660
all

3391
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:47,660
Dose

3392
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:49,660
Dose

3393
02:58:49,660 --> 02:58:51,660
Dose

3394
02:58:51,660 --> 02:58:53,660
Dose

3395
02:58:53,660 --> 02:58:55,660
Dose

3396
02:58:55,660 --> 02:58:58,660
Dose

3397
02:59:05,660 --> 02:59:12,660
Something inside me snapped, something decisive

3398
02:59:12,660 --> 02:59:14,660
<i>That proud life of his</i>

3399
02:59:14,660 --> 02:59:16,660
<i>That proud life of his</i>

3400
02:59:16,660 --> 02:59:18,660
<i>That proud life of his</i>

3401
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:20,660
<i>Vanished into the dusts of time</i>

3402
02:59:20,660 --> 02:59:28,660
<i>Vanished into the dusts of time</i>

3403
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:38,660
<i>His golden spirit</i>

3404
02:59:41,660 --> 02:59:45,660
<i>His golden spirit</i>

3405
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:47,660
<i>(Phantom Blood)</i>

3406
02:59:47,660 --> 02:59:49,660
All live

3407
02:59:49,660 --> 02:59:52,660
<i>Like two who make one,</i>

3408
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:57,660
<i>Like two who make one,</i>

3409
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:00,660
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

3410
03:00:00,660 --> 03:00:03,660
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

3411
03:00:06,660 --> 03:00:10,660
<i>Hey, JoJo</i>

3412
03:00:10,660 --> 03:00:16,660
<i>Keep looking at the stars</i>

3413
03:00:16,660 --> 03:00:21,660
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

3414
03:00:21,660 --> 03:00:24,660
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

3415
03:00:30,660 --> 03:00:32,660
<i>We’ll reach out to the stars</i>

3416
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:35,660
<i>Our two fates</i>

3417
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:38,660
<i>Our two fates</i>

3418
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:40,660
Speak

3419
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:42,660
<i>Have become one</i>

3420
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:49,660
<i>Is born anew</i>

3421
03:00:52,660 --> 03:00:54,660
<i>I’ll live</i>

3422
03:01:16,660 --> 03:01:18,660
<i>(Living in the shadow of history)</i>

3423
03:01:18,660 --> 03:01:20,660
<i>(Living in the shadow of history)</i>

3424
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:22,660
<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

3425
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:24,660
<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

3426
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:26,660
<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

3427
03:01:26,660 --> 03:01:28,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3428
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:29,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3429
03:01:29,660 --> 03:01:35,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3430
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:39,660
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

3431
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:44,660
<i>(Our golden spirit will shine)</i>

3432
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:46,660
Dead

3433
03:01:46,660 --> 03:01:48,660
Dead

3434
03:01:49,660 --> 03:01:54,660
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

3435
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:57,660
Of course,

3436
03:01:57,660 --> 03:02:01,660
Something in my eyes

3437
03:02:07,660 --> 03:02:10,660
Two in One

3438
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:14,660
Feeling the friendship of a dog

3439
03:02:14,660 --> 03:02:18,660
That's right

3440
03:02:18,660 --> 03:02:21,660
Without you

3441
03:02:21,660 --> 03:02:24,660
Because you were there

3442
03:02:24,660 --> 03:02:26,660
something

3443
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:30,660
Now I

3444
03:02:30,660 --> 03:02:32,660
want

3445
03:02:32,660 --> 03:02:35,660
Find

3446
03:02:35,660 --> 03:02:38,660
To your favorite destiny

3447
03:02:38,660 --> 03:02:42,660
Beautiful Mikade

3448
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:45,660
In the stars

3449
03:02:45,660 --> 03:02:47,660
I drink

3450
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,660
The two

3451
03:02:49,660 --> 03:02:53,660
That fate

3452
03:02:53,660 --> 03:02:55,660
It was terrible

3453
03:02:55,660 --> 03:02:57,660
Another breast

3454
03:02:57,660 --> 03:03:00,660
Quietly unknown

3455
03:03:00,660 --> 03:03:04,660
One saw the stars

3456
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:32,660
Tour

3457
03:03:32,660 --> 03:03:36,140
Is it polar?

3458
03:03:54,340 --> 03:03:57,120
pick up the station

3459
03:03:57,360 --> 03:04:00,700
my frightenedzz

3460
03:04:00,700 --> 03:04:08,700
Speedwagon is so cool!

3461
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:14,700
Yuishie, Yoishie!

3462
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:34,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3463
03:05:00,700 --> 03:05:04,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3464
03:05:30,700 --> 03:05:34,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3465
03:06:00,700 --> 03:06:04,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3466
03:06:30,700 --> 03:06:34,700
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.

3467
03:07:00,700 --> 03:07:04,700
The musical will close tomorrow, though.

3468
03:07:30,700 --> 03:07:34,700
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

3469
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:04,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3470
03:08:30,700 --> 03:08:34,700
Nah, it’s probably okay.

3471
03:09:00,700 --> 03:09:04,700
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

3472
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:34,700
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

3473
03:10:00,700 --> 03:10:04,700
You were just that wonderful.

3474
03:10:30,700 --> 03:10:34,700
Thank you everyone in the cast!

3475
03:11:00,700 --> 03:11:04,700
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

3476
03:11:30,700 --> 03:11:34,700
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

3477
03:12:00,700 --> 03:12:04,700
Yuishy, ​​Yuishy, ​​Yuishy!

3478
03:12:30,700 --> 03:12:44,700
The best thing about this park was that the smiles of all the customers were the biggest smiles. I felt that very strongly at the park.

3479
03:12:44,700 --> 03:12:52,700
I was truly happy that such a miraculous park had been able to survive to the very end.

3480
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:56,700
Thank you for watching.

3481
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:06,700
Now, Mr. Kong, please.

3482
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:10,700
Thank you for watching.

3483
03:13:10,700 --> 03:13:14,700
Great staff, great cast.

3484
03:13:14,700 --> 03:13:18,700
Then they brought the outbreak to the theater.

3485
03:13:18,700 --> 03:13:22,700
I'm glad to meet everyone who has watched the video.

3486
03:13:22,700 --> 03:13:24,700
I easily overcame the progression.

3487
03:13:24,700 --> 03:13:26,700
The players were able to go home after today's academy.

3488
03:13:26,700 --> 03:13:30,700
I'm happy for people.

3489
03:13:30,700 --> 03:13:34,700
I let it happen.

3490
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,700
thank you.

3491
03:13:36,700 --> 03:13:40,700
And I was struggling as a single person.

3492
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:42,700
My son!

3493
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:46,700
That's amazing!

3494
03:13:46,700 --> 03:13:48,700
I'm so happy!

3495
03:13:48,700 --> 03:13:50,700
I'm so happy!

3496
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:54,700
It's great.

3497
03:13:54,700 --> 03:13:56,700
It's great.

3498
03:13:56,700 --> 03:13:58,700
thank you.

3499
03:13:58,700 --> 03:14:02,700
Then, I received the greeting I just mentioned.

3500
03:14:02,700 --> 03:14:04,700
Thank you for watching.

3501
03:14:04,700 --> 03:14:06,700
thank you very much.

3502
03:14:06,700 --> 03:14:08,700
Thank you very much.

3503
03:14:08,700 --> 03:14:12,700
Everyone, please check out Fauci's Prround Funding.

3504
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:14,700
thank you.

3505
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:16,700
thank you.

3506
03:14:16,700 --> 03:14:18,700
[INAUDIBLE]

3507
03:14:18,700 --> 03:14:20,700
[INAUDIBLE]

3508
03:14:20,700 --> 03:14:22,700
MAMORU: It’s already over.

3509
03:14:22,700 --> 03:14:24,700
MAMORU: It’s already over.

3510
03:14:24,700 --> 03:14:26,700
Thank you! Thank you!

3511
03:14:26,700 --> 03:14:28,700
Thank you! Thank you!

3512
03:14:32,700 --> 03:14:34,700
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

3513
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:36,700
MAMORU: Do your best!

3514
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:38,700
MAMORU: Thanks!

3515
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:40,700
MAMORU: Thanks!

3516
03:14:42,700 --> 03:14:44,700
So Misha, please.

3517
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:46,700
yes.

3518
03:14:46,700 --> 03:14:48,700
It was a huge hurdle.

3519
03:14:48,700 --> 03:14:52,700
I'm not sure if I can speak well,

3520
03:14:52,700 --> 03:14:56,700
This is Elina Tendul and her character Shimis Misha.

3521
03:15:00,700 --> 03:15:04,700
Thank you very much for coming to the audience today.

{\an5}Special thanks to our wonderful
Japanese friends who helped us along the way!

3529
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:34,700
Please do, everyone.

3530
03:15:42,700 --> 03:15:44,700
Please look at the stars, everyone.

3531
03:15:48,700 --> 03:15:50,700
So please have a great war.

3532
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:52,700
yes.

3533
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:54,700
It's your job to burn the speeder!

3534
03:15:58,700 --> 03:16:02,700
It was my first experience and it was really difficult for me.

3535
03:16:02,700 --> 03:16:04,700
But really.

3536
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,700
It was really hard, but

3537
03:16:06,700 --> 03:16:08,700
Already, somehow,

3538
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:10,700
To get support,

3539
03:16:10,700 --> 03:16:12,700
Thanks,

3540
03:16:12,700 --> 03:16:14,700
It was really hard, but

3541
03:16:14,700 --> 03:16:16,700
Already, somehow,

3542
03:16:16,700 --> 03:16:18,700
To get support,

3543
03:16:18,700 --> 03:16:20,700
Like supporting them,

3544
03:16:20,700 --> 03:16:22,700
Supporting each other,

3545
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:24,700
Those words truly mean,

3546
03:16:24,700 --> 03:16:26,700
It just seemed to enter my body.

3547
03:16:26,700 --> 03:16:28,700
It's a really wonderful place,

3548
03:16:28,700 --> 03:16:30,700
Thanks to that,

3549
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:32,700
I was able to cut it thickly.

3550
03:16:32,700 --> 03:16:36,700
So, I have nothing but the best to say,

3551
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:38,700
With everyone here on stage,

3552
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:40,700
As Kochi-san also said,

3553
03:16:40,700 --> 03:16:42,700
Not at all.

3554
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:44,700
Although he's not here now,

3555
03:16:44,700 --> 03:16:46,700
The staff who helped me create it,

3556
03:16:46,700 --> 03:16:48,700
and,

3557
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:50,700
This role,

3558
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:52,700
For five months,

3559
03:16:52,700 --> 03:16:54,700
I really put it together,

3560
03:16:54,700 --> 03:16:56,700
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

3561
03:16:56,700 --> 03:16:58,700
Love women,

3562
03:16:58,700 --> 03:17:00,700
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

3563
03:17:00,700 --> 03:17:02,700
Including everyone who loves me,

3564
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:04,700
Really,

3565
03:17:04,700 --> 03:17:06,700
thank you very much!

3566
03:17:11,700 --> 03:17:14,700
Shirae-san...

3567
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:16,700
Good job, Dig putting is burning well.

3568
03:17:16,700 --> 03:17:19,700
I certainly understand.

3569
03:17:19,700 --> 03:17:20,700
Honchitsu,

3570
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:24,700
To Sepulija,

3571
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:26,700
To Sepulija,

3572
03:17:26,700 --> 03:17:27,940
RPM improved office

3573
03:17:27,940 --> 03:17:29,700
Wang's school committee came to the event.

3574
03:17:29,700 --> 03:17:30,700
Thank you for your continued support.

3575
03:17:30,700 --> 03:17:32,700
Thank you very much.

3576
03:17:34,700 --> 03:17:35,700
Really,

3577
03:17:35,700 --> 03:17:37,700
The first thought is,

3578
03:17:37,700 --> 03:17:40,700
There were a lot of different things that happened.

3579
03:17:40,700 --> 03:17:43,700
The two of them, Shotaro, and now, here

3580
03:17:43,700 --> 03:17:46,700
The one who finished the tree, and another Teperi,

3581
03:17:46,700 --> 03:17:50,700
Hiro-kun and I accomplished so much on our own.

3582
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:53,700
Mom, this company is a one-lens camera for people.

3583
03:17:53,700 --> 03:17:56,700
With the determination to align

3584
03:17:56,700 --> 03:17:58,700
I came here with the aim of becoming a teacher of Wang's music.

3585
03:17:58,700 --> 03:18:01,700
Really, without anyone calling

3586
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:03,700
Of course, I'm really grateful that I've come this far.

3587
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:06,700
Medical support from staff

3588
03:18:06,700 --> 03:18:08,700
It is the result of your efforts.

3589
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:10,700
Every single stage, really

3590
03:18:10,700 --> 03:18:12,700
I just want to omit it.

3591
03:18:12,700 --> 03:18:13,700
Every single stage, really

3592
03:18:13,700 --> 03:18:16,700
The applause of the Baraline and 5000 yen are us

3593
03:18:16,700 --> 03:18:18,700
Now the cast is

3594
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:20,700
The truth is, it's your Hamon energy.

3595
03:18:20,700 --> 03:18:22,700
How much courage it gave us

3596
03:18:22,700 --> 03:18:25,700
I think that's what we really feel.

3597
03:18:25,700 --> 03:18:29,700
I was really close to Hantoshi and Okabetsu right now.

3598
03:18:29,700 --> 03:18:32,700
It really is like a family

3599
03:18:32,700 --> 03:18:35,700
It means that today will be a valley from tomorrow onwards.

3600
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:37,700
Hey hey

3601
03:18:37,700 --> 03:18:39,700
Annie

3602
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:43,700
A little Syriaria please

3603
03:18:43,700 --> 03:18:45,700
Just a little bit

3604
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:47,700
I feel lonely though

3605
03:18:47,700 --> 03:18:49,700
I really love myself

3606
03:18:49,700 --> 03:18:50,700
This woman's world

3607
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:52,700
And with these beloved members

3608
03:18:52,700 --> 03:18:54,700
In this theater

3609
03:18:54,700 --> 03:18:56,700
Being able to breathe the same air

3610
03:18:56,700 --> 03:18:58,700
That's right.

3611
03:18:58,700 --> 03:19:01,700
The one who touched everyone's hearts was

3612
03:19:05,700 --> 03:19:07,700
I have become a treasure too

3613
03:19:07,700 --> 03:19:09,700
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

3614
03:19:09,700 --> 03:19:11,700
Thank you so much everyone

3615
03:19:11,700 --> 03:19:13,700
thank you

3616
03:19:13,700 --> 03:19:15,700
It will end again

3617
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:17,700
Blatzer

3618
03:19:21,700 --> 03:19:23,700
Please watch

3619
03:19:27,700 --> 03:19:29,700
I changed my boss's environment.

3620
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:30,700
Another ironworker

3621
03:19:30,700 --> 03:19:32,700
Thank you for today

3622
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:37,700
It's totally free

3623
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:39,700
So many

3624
03:19:39,700 --> 03:19:42,700
As you have written earlier,

3625
03:19:42,700 --> 03:19:44,700
Right from here on

3626
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:46,700
As in the title above

3627
03:19:46,700 --> 03:19:49,700
It was a strange adventure.

3628
03:19:49,700 --> 03:19:54,700
There are so many people like you.

3629
03:19:54,700 --> 03:19:55,700
Only the curtain of Hara

3630
03:19:55,700 --> 03:19:57,700
Born at the Imperial Theatre

3631
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:59,700
The Imperial Theatre

3632
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:01,700
The current theater is closing.

3633
03:20:01,700 --> 03:20:03,700
As a final review

3634
03:20:03,700 --> 03:20:05,700
By producing

3635
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,700
Not Minami

3636
03:20:07,700 --> 03:20:09,700
Memories

3637
03:20:09,700 --> 03:20:11,700
Participated

3638
03:20:11,700 --> 03:20:13,700
My friends are cast members here.

3639
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:15,700
It is staff

3640
03:20:15,700 --> 03:20:17,700
And the original author

3641
03:20:17,700 --> 03:20:19,700
The main cast members

3642
03:20:19,700 --> 03:20:21,700
And here are the books.

3643
03:20:21,700 --> 03:20:23,700
After five years of work

3644
03:20:23,700 --> 03:20:25,700
Apparently it was rewritten 17 times.

3645
03:20:25,700 --> 03:20:27,700
It was in this flow that I was born.

3646
03:20:27,700 --> 03:20:29,700
This work

3647
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:31,700
Being accepted by everyone like this

3648
03:20:31,700 --> 03:20:32,700
Like this

3649
03:20:32,700 --> 03:20:33,700
Many musicals

3650
03:20:33,700 --> 03:20:35,700
We have some works from overseas.

3651
03:20:35,700 --> 03:20:36,700
Such works are

3652
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:37,700
Zahiozic Zero is

3653
03:20:37,700 --> 03:20:39,700
On Broadway and in the West End

3654
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:41,700
That's what we're here for

3655
03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:42,700
In books

3656
03:20:42,700 --> 03:20:44,700
While making large replicas

3657
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:46,700
Let's fight

3658
03:20:46,700 --> 03:20:47,700
Japanese style

3659
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:49,700
We provide information.

3660
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:50,700
This work is

3661
03:20:50,700 --> 03:20:51,700
What you all saw

3662
03:20:51,700 --> 03:20:52,700
Exactly

3663
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:54,700
From zero to one

3664
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:55,700
Became Zahiozic

3665
03:20:55,700 --> 03:20:57,700
I think it's a work of art.

3666
03:20:57,700 --> 03:20:58,700
This work

3667
03:20:58,700 --> 03:20:59,700
Someday again

3668
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:01,700
Inherited

3669
03:21:01,700 --> 03:21:03,700
It may be a big performance,

3670
03:21:03,700 --> 03:21:05,700
This Zahiozik

3671
03:21:05,700 --> 03:21:06,700
I was at Zero 1

3672
03:21:06,700 --> 03:21:07,700
The friends here

3673
03:21:07,700 --> 03:21:08,700
Really I

3674
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:09,700
It's just for the time being.

3675
03:21:09,700 --> 03:21:11,700
Zayn

3676
03:21:11,700 --> 03:21:14,700
I feel like a son or daughter to you.

3677
03:21:14,700 --> 03:21:20,700
Only one person was different

3678
03:21:20,700 --> 03:21:23,700
Since they share the same father

3679
03:21:23,700 --> 03:21:26,700
One as a father

3680
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:28,700
Mud and Stars

3681
03:21:28,700 --> 03:21:29,700
University

3682
03:21:29,700 --> 03:21:30,700
A work ticket

3683
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:31,700
As a friend

3684
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:32,700
from now on

3685
03:21:32,700 --> 03:21:33,700
At the Shibutoku Musical

3686
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:35,700
I want to survive

3687
03:21:40,700 --> 03:21:41,700
Truly amazing

3688
03:21:41,700 --> 03:21:43,700
Two sons

3689
03:21:43,700 --> 03:21:44,700
Like this

3690
03:21:44,700 --> 03:21:46,700
I can have it

3691
03:21:46,700 --> 03:21:47,700
A little bit today

3692
03:21:47,700 --> 03:21:48,700
You might be watching from anywhere

3693
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:49,700
Also serving

3694
03:21:49,700 --> 03:21:50,700
As a son

3695
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:52,700
Nice to meet you

3696
03:21:52,700 --> 03:21:53,700
Truly amazing

3697
03:21:53,700 --> 03:21:54,700
Yesterday

3698
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:55,700
As a father

3699
03:21:55,700 --> 03:21:56,700
I was able to participate

3700
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:57,700
Hello everyone

3701
03:21:57,700 --> 03:21:59,700
If you have any worries

3702
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:00,700
Finally

3703
03:22:00,700 --> 03:22:01,700
What is it?

3704
03:22:01,700 --> 03:22:02,700
Within myself

3705
03:22:02,700 --> 03:22:04,700
It's all connected

3706
03:22:04,700 --> 03:22:06,700
That it all has meaning

3707
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:07,700
a little bit

3708
03:22:07,700 --> 03:22:08,700
If you think so

3709
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:09,700
surely

3710
03:22:09,700 --> 03:22:10,700
Beyond that

3711
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:11,700
There is light

3712
03:22:11,700 --> 03:22:12,700
There are stars

3713
03:22:12,700 --> 03:22:13,700
If you think so

3714
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:15,700
I think it's that kind of work.

3715
03:22:15,700 --> 03:22:16,700
thank you

3716
03:22:24,700 --> 03:22:25,700
Well then

3717
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:26,700
I will do my best

3718
03:22:36,700 --> 03:22:38,700
Where should I start?

3719
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:39,700
Already

3720
03:22:45,700 --> 03:22:46,700
But anyway

3721
03:22:52,700 --> 03:22:54,700
I'm glad we met

3722
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:56,700
Hotz

3723
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:06,700
We

3724
03:23:06,700 --> 03:23:07,700
Entertainment and

3725
03:23:07,700 --> 03:23:09,700
I'm trying not to

3726
03:23:11,700 --> 03:23:12,700
Sometimes after all

3727
03:23:12,700 --> 03:23:13,700
There are times when it's difficult

3728
03:23:20,700 --> 03:23:21,700
There are times when it's scary

3729
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:23,700
but

3730
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,700
The Minister just said

3731
03:23:25,700 --> 03:23:26,700
As you said

3732
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:27,700
Something

3733
03:23:27,700 --> 03:23:28,700
In the purely literal sense

3734
03:23:28,700 --> 03:23:30,700
Don't do it right away

3735
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:33,700
In the truest sense

3736
03:23:33,700 --> 03:23:34,700
Do it now

3737
03:23:34,700 --> 03:23:36,700
That's what it means

3738
03:23:38,700 --> 03:23:39,700
I am this

3739
03:23:39,700 --> 03:23:41,700
I felt it at Campari.

3740
03:23:42,700 --> 03:23:43,700
of course

3741
03:23:48,700 --> 03:23:50,700
A lot of things happened

3742
03:23:50,700 --> 03:23:51,700
Something like that

3743
03:23:53,700 --> 03:23:55,700
Only in those words

3744
03:23:55,700 --> 03:23:57,700
I might not be able to tell you right now, but

3745
03:23:58,700 --> 03:24:00,700
And more

3746
03:24:00,700 --> 03:24:01,700
I

3747
03:24:01,700 --> 03:24:02,700
now

3748
03:24:05,700 --> 03:24:06,700
As a treasure

3749
03:24:06,700 --> 03:24:08,700
I was able to have

3750
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:09,700
Above all

3751
03:24:09,700 --> 03:24:10,700
It

3752
03:24:10,700 --> 03:24:11,700
so

3753
03:24:13,700 --> 03:24:14,700
lots of

3754
03:24:16,700 --> 03:24:18,700
To humans

3755
03:24:24,700 --> 03:24:26,700
That you can enjoy it

3756
03:24:26,700 --> 03:24:27,700
After all, it's ours

3757
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:29,700
It's the happiest thing

3758
03:24:29,700 --> 03:24:30,700
It

3759
03:24:30,700 --> 03:24:32,700
With this member

3760
03:24:32,700 --> 03:24:34,700
It can be closed on paper

3761
03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:36,700
I am happy

3762
03:24:37,700 --> 03:24:38,700
Women

3763
03:24:38,700 --> 03:24:40,700
Giant player fun

3764
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:42,700
I welcomed

3765
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:45,700
My father just now

3766
03:24:45,700 --> 03:24:47,700
As you said

3767
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:49,700
We will continue to do so

3768
03:24:49,700 --> 03:24:51,700
Look forward

3769
03:24:51,700 --> 03:24:52,700
Surely soon

3770
03:24:52,700 --> 03:24:54,700
Each on their own path

3771
03:24:54,700 --> 03:24:55,700
Various expressions

3772
03:24:57,700 --> 03:24:59,700
I think I'll pursue it

3773
03:25:00,700 --> 03:25:01,700
Not yet

3774
03:25:02,700 --> 03:25:04,700
It will be useful

3775
03:25:07,700 --> 03:25:08,700
Dad too

3776
03:25:13,700 --> 03:25:15,700
Let's definitely meet again

3777
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:16,700
and

3778
03:25:17,700 --> 03:25:18,700
Also this woman

3779
03:25:18,700 --> 03:25:20,700
I think it would be a good story if we could meet.

3780
03:25:23,700 --> 03:25:25,700
It's all connected

3781
03:25:28,700 --> 03:25:30,700
I dream of such a day

3782
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:31,700
Today is really

3783
03:25:31,700 --> 03:25:32,700
To everyone

3784
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:33,700
I want to express my gratitude

3785
03:25:33,700 --> 03:25:34,700
everyone

3786
03:25:34,700 --> 03:25:35,700
thank you

3787
03:25:44,700 --> 03:25:46,700
amazing

3788
03:25:46,700 --> 03:25:47,700
I'll say something good.

3789
03:25:53,700 --> 03:25:56,700
I think Bappy will decide.

3790
03:25:57,700 --> 03:25:58,700
thank you

3791
03:25:59,700 --> 03:26:00,700
Woman

3792
03:26:00,700 --> 03:26:01,700
I pushed the woman down.

3793
03:26:01,700 --> 03:26:02,700
This is Arisa Shotaro

3794
03:26:06,700 --> 03:26:07,700
everyone

3795
03:26:07,700 --> 03:26:08,700
Really

3796
03:26:09,700 --> 03:26:11,700
Those who noticed

3797
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:12,700
I don't know, but

3798
03:26:13,700 --> 03:26:14,700
I

3799
03:26:15,700 --> 03:26:16,700
Because I'm this kind of person

3800
03:26:17,700 --> 03:26:18,700
Even if I stand in the middle

3801
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:20,700
After all, everyone

3802
03:26:20,700 --> 03:26:21,700
Many people

3803
03:26:21,700 --> 03:26:23,700
For holding me and supporting me

3804
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:24,700
already

3805
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:26,700
Warm

3806
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:28,700
Someone like my older brother

3807
03:26:28,700 --> 03:26:29,700
He was already a family man

3808
03:26:29,700 --> 03:26:30,700
People like

3809
03:26:30,700 --> 03:26:31,700
Because that's fine for you

3810
03:26:31,700 --> 03:26:33,700
You can go with that humanity

3811
03:26:33,700 --> 03:26:34,700
Just those words are enough

3812
03:26:34,700 --> 03:26:36,700
I really have come this far

3813
03:26:36,700 --> 03:26:38,700
But still

3814
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:40,700
When I look around,

3815
03:26:40,700 --> 03:26:42,700
After all, this time everyone

3816
03:26:43,700 --> 03:26:44,700
After all

3817
03:26:44,700 --> 03:26:46,700
Cress

3818
03:26:46,700 --> 03:26:48,700
I've seen your face after all

3819
03:26:48,700 --> 03:26:49,700
Really everyone

3820
03:26:49,700 --> 03:26:50,700
too

3821
03:26:50,700 --> 03:26:52,700
After all, the curtain won't open

3822
03:26:52,700 --> 03:26:55,700
There were many things that caused me anxiety.

3823
03:26:55,700 --> 03:26:56,700
I think there is.

3824
03:26:56,700 --> 03:26:57,700
That voice also reached me

3825
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:59,700
It arrived directly after all

3826
03:26:59,700 --> 03:27:02,700
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3827
03:27:03,700 --> 03:27:04,700
What's going on?

3828
03:27:04,700 --> 03:27:06,700
Ride and enjoy

3829
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:07,700
There are various messages

3830
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:09,700
I saw the power of seeing.

3831
03:27:09,700 --> 03:27:10,700
just

3832
03:27:10,700 --> 03:27:12,700
I

3833
03:27:13,700 --> 03:27:15,700
I really believe in everyone

3834
03:27:16,700 --> 03:27:17,700
I'm working hard here

3835
03:27:17,700 --> 03:27:18,700
Because I've been watching everyone

3836
03:27:20,700 --> 03:27:22,700
Watch it.

3837
03:27:22,700 --> 03:27:23,700
Feelings

3838
03:27:24,700 --> 03:27:26,700
I just want you to wear it

3839
03:27:26,700 --> 03:27:28,700
That's really the only feeling

3840
03:27:29,700 --> 03:27:30,700
Not

3841
03:27:30,700 --> 03:27:31,700
Together

3842
03:27:31,700 --> 03:27:33,200
There are so many different

3843
03:27:33,200 --> 03:27:34,700
Overcoming a big wall

3844
03:27:34,700 --> 03:27:35,700
already

3845
03:27:35,700 --> 03:27:37,700
Even if the conversation doesn't change

3846
03:27:37,700 --> 03:27:38,700
Invisible

3847
03:27:38,700 --> 03:27:40,700
It's a bond

3848
03:27:40,700 --> 03:27:41,700
That's already the case

3849
03:27:41,700 --> 03:27:42,700
Don don don don

3850
03:27:42,700 --> 03:27:44,700
That means we're connected

3851
03:27:44,700 --> 03:27:46,700
I've been feeling this trend for a long time now

3852
03:27:47,700 --> 03:27:48,700
After all

3853
03:27:48,700 --> 03:27:49,700
Makuha is open

3854
03:27:50,700 --> 03:27:51,700
Jonah Joshi's

3855
03:27:51,700 --> 03:27:53,700
What is the other Yuya-san?

3856
03:27:53,700 --> 03:27:55,700
Really

3857
03:27:55,700 --> 03:27:58,700
We've talked about a lot of things up until today

3858
03:27:58,700 --> 03:28:00,700
Yesterday's Yuya's war loss

3859
03:28:00,700 --> 03:28:02,700
Watching Hiro's wartime success

3860
03:28:02,700 --> 03:28:04,700
After all,

3861
03:28:04,700 --> 03:28:06,700
There was today

3862
03:28:07,700 --> 03:28:08,700
One more

3863
03:28:08,700 --> 03:28:11,700
I feel like I've really completed it.

3864
03:28:11,700 --> 03:28:13,700
I got into the mood.

3865
03:28:13,700 --> 03:28:16,700
I've seen some really amazing things

3866
03:28:16,700 --> 03:28:17,700
on second thoughts

3867
03:28:17,700 --> 03:28:18,700
I'm glad I worked hard

3868
03:28:18,700 --> 03:28:19,700
Really already

3869
03:28:19,700 --> 03:28:21,700
As of yesterday, I felt

3870
03:28:21,700 --> 03:28:22,700
So today, everyone

3871
03:28:22,700 --> 03:28:23,700
so

3872
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:25,700
I can see that face in Chi-up

3873
03:28:25,700 --> 03:28:27,700
Really I

3874
03:28:27,700 --> 03:28:29,700
With a heartfelt joy

3875
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:30,700
There are lots

3876
03:28:30,700 --> 03:28:32,700
As it was at the beginning

3877
03:28:32,700 --> 03:28:33,700
I

3878
03:28:33,700 --> 03:28:36,700
I think it's a historic evolution.

3879
03:28:36,700 --> 03:28:37,700
To the world

3880
03:28:37,700 --> 03:28:38,700
Really already

3881
03:28:38,700 --> 03:28:40,700
We all worked hard to create it

3882
03:28:40,700 --> 03:28:41,700
already

3883
03:28:41,700 --> 03:28:43,700
This guy

3884
03:28:43,700 --> 03:28:44,700
This guy gave it to me in the field.

3885
03:28:44,700 --> 03:28:45,700
Together

3886
03:28:45,700 --> 03:28:46,700
I want to keep up

3887
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:47,700
already

3888
03:28:47,700 --> 03:28:48,700
try as hard as one can

3889
03:28:48,700 --> 03:28:49,700
Climb, climb, climb, climb up the mountain

3890
03:28:49,700 --> 03:28:51,700
today

3891
03:28:51,700 --> 03:28:52,700
Really

3892
03:28:52,700 --> 03:28:54,700
I think I was able to make everyone happy.

3893
03:28:54,700 --> 03:28:55,700
Thank you so much

3894
03:29:05,700 --> 03:29:07,700
Me too

3895
03:29:07,700 --> 03:29:08,700
Really

3896
03:29:08,700 --> 03:29:10,700
I spoke without thinking

3897
03:29:10,700 --> 03:29:11,700
Maybe

3898
03:29:11,700 --> 03:29:12,700
no

3899
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:13,700
That's not true

3900
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:16,700
Some people may think that

3901
03:29:16,700 --> 03:29:18,700
This is definitely

3902
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:19,700
already

3903
