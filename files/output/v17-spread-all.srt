You, watching this.

Yeah, you there.

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
You have been chosen.

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,816
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

7
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:41,952
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.
{\ O (spread): You are watching this}

8
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:48,088
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.
{\ O (spread): yes}

9
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:54,224
It keeps moving forward.

10
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:00,360
That is why I have to
create this record now.
{\ O (spread): You have been chosen}

11
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
If something should
happen to me, I—
{\ O (rank): I decided it was worth believing.}

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Never mind.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Back to the story.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,104
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

15
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:23,128
Such as medicine, pharmacy, and archaeology—

16
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:28,152
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

17
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:33,176
That’s how it looks on the outside.

18
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:38,200
Right, that’s the cover.

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Now, listen carefully.

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,173
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

21
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:52,146
And created our branches around the world...
{\ O (spread): If something happens to me in the future}

22
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:58,120
That secret is...
{\ O (spread): no}

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
The Stone Mask.
{\ O (rank): Let's get back to the topic}

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:27,840
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,800
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

27
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,200
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It all began in the 13th century.

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,297
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

30
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:57,794
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

31
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:01,291
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Please listen carefully}

00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,788
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>
{\ O (spread): I founded this foundation here in the United States and have branches all over the world.}

33
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:08,285
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It's to pursue the secret of something.}

34
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,782
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>
{\ O (spread): What is that something?}

35
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:15,279
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>
{\ O (spread): Stone Mask}

36
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,776
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The Foundation's true purpose is to uncover the secrets of the Stone Mask.}

37
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:22,280
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>
{\ O (spread): And today, I'm recording the story of the mask.}

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,080
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>
{\ O (rank): And the story of the golden spirit that was there}

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,593
{\an8}<i>(Eternal!)</i>

40
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:33,106
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It began in the 16th century}

41

{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

43
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,645
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

44
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,158
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): I have the power of life, eternal power, eternal life in my hands.}

45
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,671
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

46
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,184
<i>Blood of the living</i>

47
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:43,697
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): We are children of the sun}

<i>Life is power</i>

{\an8}<i>(We sacrifice!)</i>
{\ O (spread): was disliked}

50
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,236
<i>The power in this hand</i>
{\ O (spread): But one day the tribe suddenly disappeared.}

51
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,760
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>
{\ O (spread): All of this mystery lies in the Stone Mask}

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
<i>(We are children of the sun!)</i>
{\ O (rank): This story is about the Stone Mask}

53
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,380
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

54
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,842
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

59
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:26,684
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

60
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:30,526
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

61
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,368
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

62
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:38,210
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

63
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,052
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

64
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:45,894
Wot have we here!

65
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:49,736
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

66
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:53,578
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

67
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:57,420
-Hang on...

68
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,262
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

69
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:05,104
-Wait!

70
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:08,946
I said wait!

71
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:12,788
Yahoo!

72
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,630
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

73
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,472

they gotta be nobles!
{\ O (spread): There must be something good in this box}

It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

75
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:28,156
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

76
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:32,000
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This box’ll have somethin’ good...
{\ O (rank): Find something valuable, something valuable}

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,714
What the—
{\ O (spread): Don't have a nice ring?}

79
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,428
Just a creepy mask!
{\ O (spread): What are you doing?}

80
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,142
Don’t need that!

81
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,856
Darling!

82
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,570
What?!

83
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,284
In the carriage! A baby survived!

84
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,000
A baby?! Leave it there!

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh...

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, isn’t this a nice ring? I’ll take that!

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
-What are you doing?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,555
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

90
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:04,110
Have a look!

91
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,665
A pocket watch too!
{\ O (spread): Did you release me?}

92
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,220
Nice teeth!
{\ O (spread): My wife and son}

93
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,775
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.
{\ O (spread): His wife had already passed away}

94
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,330
That’s enough!
{\ O (spread): The baby is safe}

95
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,885
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

96
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,440
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

97
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,000
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.
{\ O (spread): Is this fate?}

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You... Did you rescue us...?
{\ O (rank): I want to thank you for saving my life}

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are my wife and son...?
{\ O (rank): My name is Joestar}

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She croa—
{\ O (spread): I will never forget this kindness}

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.
{\ O (gap): It's not worth mentioning, but}

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Go get him!
{\ O (spread): brand}

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this too is fate...

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to express my gratitude
to you for saving my life...

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My name is Joestar...

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will never forget your kindness!

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Dario Brando!

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,444
And so the years flow by until 1880.

110
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:15,888
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

111
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:21,332
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

114

<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride

{\ O (spread): A voice, a familiar voice}

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
{\an8}I hear those voices,

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
{\an8}Those oh-so-familiar voices!

C’mon, let’s go!

Don’t let this brat go!

Little puke stain!

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What’re you looking at, smart-arse?

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oi!
{\ O (spread): What are you looking at?}

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How’s your old man doing, shitstain?
{\ O (gap): You idiot!}

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,750
He croak or somethin’?

189
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,500
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!
{\ O (spread): How's your dad doing?}

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,250
Shame, she was a real looker!
{\ O (spread): I haven't seen it since the bar went bust!}

191
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,000
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is it, Father?

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Nah, I don’t need that.

196
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,000
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,500
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,000
I’m worried that after I die...
{\ O (spread): Can't you hear me?}

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,500
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Oi!
{\ O (spread): What is it, Dad?}

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Dio!

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Take this.
{\ O (spread): I don't need medicine}

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
“Joestar”?

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He’s a noble.
{\ O (spread): Dio}

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And he owes me one.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When I die, send him that letter.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go to him.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,333
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

209
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,666
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

210
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,000
Father...

Listen up...
{\ O (gap): Moreover, Osotoyoshino}

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You’re a smart boy.

215

Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

216
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:34,284
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>
{\ O (spread): When I die, send that letter.}

217

<i>I might already be in hell,

<i>And yet, my mum told me to be noble</i>

221
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:15,000
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,600
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>
{\ O (spread): Are you acting like a father now?}

224
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Just like that...
{\ O (spread): Listen, Dio}

225
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,800
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>
{\ O (spread): You are smart.}

226
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,400
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

227
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,000
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
<i>Is it blue?</i>

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,666
<i>Tell me, Joestar</i>

230
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:09,332
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

231
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:18,000
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

233
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,333
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

234
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,666
<i>Now, I’ll go take this “inheritance”</i>

235
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:42,000
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,000
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>Is the sun shining?</i>

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Oh yeah!

242
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,800
You’ve got something good today too, eh?
{\ O (spread): Look up at the stars}

243
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,200
Give it back!

244
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Over here!

245
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,000
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My father’s a real doctor!

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!

249
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Stop right there!

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What are you doing?! Take this!
{\ O (rank): Is that sky blue?}

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!
{\ O (spread): Nacho Star}

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Ow! That hurt!
{\ O (spread): Ugly, terrible father, loser, always a loser}

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?
{\ O (rank): Under this murky sky, I continued to struggle and die}

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,
{\ O (gap): Let's receive our inheritance now, it's all from our parents, let's go on a journey}

255
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I’m gonna give him even
more of a walloping!
{\ O (spread): I still have nothing in my hands, so let's start from here}

256
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Ah-ha!
{\ O (spread): Joestar, you have the sun in the sky}

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!
{\ O (spread): That's right, Joestar}

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Danny!
{\ O (spread): Your father is a good doctor}

260
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Eh?!
{\ O (spread): What do you think?}

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let’s go already! Shit!
{\ O (spread): But it's an expensive hat}

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Uh... Are you alright?
{\ O (gap): Stop it, your mother gave it to you for your birthday.}

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Leave me alone!

264
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But...
{\ O (rank): What are you doing?}

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I did this because I wanted to.
{\ O (gap): Just because you're in front of a girl, you're trying to act cool}

266
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.
{\ O (spread): Hey, do you know who this is?}

267
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.
{\ O (spread): After all, this guy is Jona of the Joestar family.}

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I’ll beat them, someday.

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let’s go, Danny!

271
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, wait!

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jonathan Joestar...
{\ O (rank): Um, are you okay?}

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You...
{\ O (rank): Leave me alone}

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You must be Dio Brando!
{\ O (rank): but}

275
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And you’re...
{\ O (spread): I did it because I wanted to, not to be thanked by you.}

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Jonathan Joestar?
{\ O (gap): I'm aiming for true sincerity. You were a girl and I was having trouble with you, so I just stood up to you.}

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!
{\ O (gap): Someday I'll be able to win}

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,333
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.
{\ O (spread): Okay, let's go}

279
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,666
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!
{\ O (spread): Jonathan Joestar}

280
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Friend?

282
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah!
{\ O (spread): you}

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Danny! What was that for!
{\ O (spread): You're Dio Brando!}

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Danny!
{\ O (rank): So you're Jonathan Joestar?}

285
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You won’t get away with this!
{\ O (spread): Everyone calls me Chocho!}

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.
{\ O (gap): Looking forward to working with you.}

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Lord Joestar!
{\ O (gap): Let me introduce you to my friend Danny.}

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Come inside!
{\ O (spread): It's a very useful shape.}

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Something wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread): friend?}

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah, nothing.

292
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.
{\ O (gap): What are you doing? I won't forgive you!}

293
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,586
Starting today, you are part of our family.
{\ O (spread): I've been waiting for you, Diobrando.}

294
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:05,172
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

295
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,760
Yes!
{\ O (spread): Come in. This is the mansion where you will be living from today onwards.}

296
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.
{\ O (gap): What's up, JoJo?}

297
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Mister Brando!
{\ O (spread): You must be tired from traveling all the way from London, Dio.}

298
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I’m Police Inspector Archer!
{\ O (gap): From today onwards, you are part of our family. Please live your life just like our son, Jojo.}

299
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,760
Police? Has something happened?
{\ O (rank): Yes, I am grateful for Lord Joestar's actions.}

300
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,440
Oh, no!
{\ O (spread): Hehehehe.}

301
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,120
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.
{\ O (spread): Brand, this is Inspector Archer.}

302
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...
{\ O (spread): Police? Did something happen?}

303
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,480
Ah, that was—

304
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,160
-He came at me so suddenly.

305
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,840
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

306
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

307
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.
{\ O (rank): He's quite friendly, but it seems he startled you.}

308
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,660
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): JoJo, enough about Danny.}

309
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,560
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?
{\ O (spread): yes.}

310
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes, sir.
{\ O (spread): Jojo has also lost his mother, and they are the same age.}

311
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,360
Good.
{\ O (spread): Please get along well with each other.}

312
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!
{\ O (rank): Now, let me show you to your room.}

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Make sure to get along with each other.
{\ O (rank): Mr. Brand.}

314
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mister Brando!
{\ O (rank): nice to meet you!}

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Nice to have met you!

317
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,240
Ta-ta, JoJo!

318
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,320
Now then, let me get—

319
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,400
Watch it!

320
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don’t touch my bag!

321
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,420
I was just trying to carry it for—
{\ O (rank): Don't touch my bag.}

322
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,320
That’s enough.
{\ O (spread): I'll try to carry it}

323
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.
{\ O (gap): 結構}

324
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,970
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!
{\ O (spread): Your hands are sticky with dog drool}

325
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,920
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

326
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,870
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!

327
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,820
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (rank): I just try to be friendly}

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:13,120
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.
{\ O (spread): What are you both doing?}

333
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Keep your stupid dog away from me!
{\ O (spread): One more thing}

334
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread): I hate dogs}

335
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

336
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?

337
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,977
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

338
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,834
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

339
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,691
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

340
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:02,548
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>

341
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,405
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>

342
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:10,262
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

343
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:14,120
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>

344
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (rank): Here comes JoJo}

345
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,620
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

346
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,120
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

347
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,620
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

348
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,120
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

349
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

350
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

351
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,342
It’s just because I love reading so much!

352
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:46,564
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

353
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:50,786
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

354
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:55,008
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

355
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:59,230
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

356
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,452
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>

357
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:07,674
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

358
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:11,896
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

359
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:16,120
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

360
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

361
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,120
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

362
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,120
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

363
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,120
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

364
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,120
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

365
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,120
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

366
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,120
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

367
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,120
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>
{\ O (spread): How many times has this happened?}

368
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

369
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,590
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>
{\ O (spread): All uses are correct}

370
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,060
But...

371
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:06,530
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

372
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:13,000
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

374
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And so she gave them this condition:

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Here is my question for you:

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

383
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?

385
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,555
The stars?

387
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:19,110
Or the mud?
{\ O (spread): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

388
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,665
I...

389
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:20,220
I think they were looking at the mud.

390
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,775
What’s your reasoning?

391
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:21,330
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

392
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:21,885
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

393
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:22,440
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,

394
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think...

396
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,750
They held onto their honour!

398
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,500
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

399
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,250
So what!

400
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,000
So what?

401
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

402
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But they—

403
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread): Follow their example}

404
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Such regret...

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!

407
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,666
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

408
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,332
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

409
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,998
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!

410
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:28,664
Listen!

411
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,330
You’re a noble! You have it all!

412
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,000
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread): Always question philosophy and truth in your mind}

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ O (gap): There are two knights in English folklore.}

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—
{\ O (rank): One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That’s enough, you two.
{\ O (spread): The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There’s no right answer to this question.
{\ O (rank): If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

417
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,761
Bear in mind—
{\ O (spread): Here's the problem for both of you}

418
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:55,522
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread): yes}

419
00:27:55,522 --> 00:28:00,283
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread): Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

420
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:05,044
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread): Is what you see beyond the prison bars the mud in front of you?}

421
00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:09,805
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>
{\ O (spread): Or is it the star shining above?}

422
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:14,566
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>
{\ O (spread): Which do you think?}

423
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:19,327
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>

424
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:24,088
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>
{\ O (spread): I think I saw mud}

425
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:28,849
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>

426
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:33,610
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>

427
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,371
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

428
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:43,132
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

429
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:47,893
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>
{\ O (spread): I think I was looking at the stars}

430
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,654
<i>The opening bell rings</i>
{\ O (spread): You lived your life to the fullest, and your two noble names will be engraved in history.}

431
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:57,415
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>
{\ O (spread): So}

432
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:02,176
Oi!
{\ O (spread): So}

433
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:06,937
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!
{\ O (spread): How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

434
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:11,698
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!
{\ O (spread): In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

435
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:16,459
Our new champion!
{\ O (spread): That soul-dissolving powerlessness}

436
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:21,220
You did it, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): All they saw was mud.}

437
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,000
Danny would be proud!

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Is there anyone?

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Everyone listen up!

441
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.
{\ O (rank): So, in order to fulfill that responsibility, shouldn't we think about what we can accomplish with our lives?}

442
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
His name is Dio Brando!
{\ O (rank): I}

443
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,333
Dio Brando?
{\ O (spread): Neither of us have a right answer to this question.}

444
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,666
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?

445
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah! Do it!

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, let’s do it!

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000
-Good!

448
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.
{\ O (spread): Who will be the next to challenge this champion?}

450
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,000
That’s the bell!
{\ O (spread): Everyone, be quiet! A new friend has just asked to join our game!}

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
-Go, JoJo!

452
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Beat him up!
{\ O (spread): How about getting to know your new friends by getting them involved in our games?}

453
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What is this move!
{\ O (rank): Okay! Let's do it!}

454
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I’ve never seen it before!
{\ O (rank): The rule is that if you get hit by the cross section even once, you lose!}

455
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,750
Oi, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): If this is the rule, I'll throw it away if I do it in London!}

456
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,500
That’s a hit to the face!
{\ O (spread): Gong down!}

457
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,250
He lost!
{\ O (spread): Go, Jar Jarz!}

458
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:31,000
Our king! Our king!
{\ O (spread): Yay!}

459
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!
{\ O (rank): What a movement!}

460
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
My eye!
{\ O (spread): I've never seen that before!}

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Guys, guys, guys!

462
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think my finger went in his eye.

463
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,600
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!

464
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,200
-Hey, hey!

465
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

466
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Teach me!

467
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,000
Guys! Ow...

468
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Danny...

469
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

470
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It feels like he’s invading my life.
{\ O (rank): Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Darstand!}

471
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>
{\ O (gap): Everyone, Mina}

472
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>
{\ O (spread): I think my finger got in his eye.}

473
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>

474
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

476
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

477
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

478
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:21,000
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

479
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You’re...
{\ O (spread): Danny}

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My hanky...
{\ O (rank): For some reason, Dio is trying to trap me.}

481
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!
{\ O (rank): I feel like I'm being invaded more and more}

482
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,
{\ O (rank): Hey Danny, my heart hurts}

483
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So stop by again!
{\ O (spread): I'm full of anxiety}

484
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Danny!
{\ O (rank): If I were to die like this}

485
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Has it caught your fancy?
{\ O (spread): Will everyone cry?}

486
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.
{\ O (rank): You're always warm}

487
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,500
It’s alright.
{\ O (spread): Thank you for being by my side}

488
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,000
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.
{\ O (spread): If I had a mother, would it be like this?}

489
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Mexico...
{\ O (gap): Is this how you loved me?}

490
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Mm-hmm.
{\ O (spread): You're a little}

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.
{\ O (rank): My handkerchief}

492
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.
{\ O (rank): Hey, thanks for the handkerchief}

493
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.
{\ O (rank): I'll be here in the morning too}

494
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you interested in it?
{\ O (gap): If you'd like, come too.}

495
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, no. Not especially.
{\ O (spread): Danny}

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Uh...
{\ O (spread): Are you curious?}

497
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?
{\ O (rank): Sorry for touching you without permission.}

498
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.
{\ O (spread): It doesn't matter, the stone mask was apparently excavated from an archaeological site in Mexico.}

499
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Friendship? With a dog?
{\ O (spread): Mexico}

500
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.
{\ O (rank): I bought it at an art gallery in London when Jojo was just born.}

501
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,
{\ O (rank): On the way back, he had a carriage accident.}

502
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.
{\ O (rank): It was when your father helped me.}

503
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.
{\ O (rank): Are you interested?}

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.
{\ O (spread): In particular}

505
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just when JoJo was about to drown...
{\ O (spread): Jojo always goes out with Danny.}

506
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.
{\ O (spread): Danny has a friendship and trust for Jojo.}

507
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It was Danny!
{\ O (spread): Do you have a friend dog?}

508
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.
{\ O (rank): I bought Danny when Jojo was little.}

509
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.
{\ O (spread): At first, I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.}

510
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.
{\ O (rank): It didn't work out with Jojo either.}

511
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,600
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.
{\ O (spread): But one time Jojo drowned in the river.}

512
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
Is that so?
{\ O (gap): My voice is all alone and no one can hear it}

513
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
M’lord.
{\ O (spread): Just as she was about to die, a shadow heard her scream and jumped into the river. It was Danny.}

514
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Eh? Ah, that’s right.
{\ O (rank): Danny jumped into the river and saved Jojo's life.}

515
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:20,480
Friends...
{\ O (spread): Danny's courageous actions, knowing what life is}

516
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,440
Erina!
{\ O (rank): Young Jojo was touched by Danny's courage and courage.}

517
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
JoJo!
{\ O (gap): They are best friends.}

518
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,000
The two met once more!
{\ O (rank): is that so}

519
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,880
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.
{\ O (gap): Husband}

520
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,560
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.
{\ O (spread): Ah, that's right.}

521
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Danny!
{\ O (gap): 親友}

522
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Come boy!
{\ O (rank): Elna}

523
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.
{\ O (spread): Joe John}

524
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?
{\ O (rank): The two were reunited}

525
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Huh? It’s nothing.

526
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
What are you hiding?
{\ O (spread): That wonderful curiosity led Jojo to action.}

527
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
It’s nothing interesting.
{\ O (spread): Immediately the two}

528
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

529
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
You’ll just laugh!
{\ O (spread): Danny}

530
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I won’t laugh.
{\ O (rank): Come on over}

531
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
You’ll tell people!
{\ O (gap): You're so smart}

532
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
I won’t tell, so show me!

533
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
I told you, no!
{\ O (spread): Hey Jo John, what have you been digging up lately?}

534
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
JoJo!
{\ O (rank): No, nothing.}

535
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,920
Oh, my!
{\ O (spread): Why hide it?}

536
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,960
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>
{\ O (spread): It's so boring}

537
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,000
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>
{\ O (spread): If you say so, I really want to see it}

538
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,040
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>
{\ O (spread): People will laugh}

539
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh!
{\ O (spread): I won't laugh}

540
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,880
<i>To be laughing like this</i>
{\ O (rank): I'll tell someone}

541
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,580
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>
{\ O (spread): I won't tell you, so show me}

542
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,280
<i>Erina</i>
{\ O (spread): No.}

543
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>JoJo</i>
{\ O (rank): Joe John}

544
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

545
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,280
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

546
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>JoJo</i>

547
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>Erina</i>

548
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,080
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

549
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,080
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

550
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,446
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

551
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:21,812
<i>That would be so
embarrassing, you—</i>

552
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:28,178
<i>Scoundrel!</i>
{\ O (spread): I'm laughing like that now}

553
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:34,544
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>
{\ O (spread): Vivid River Pool}

554
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:40,910
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>
{\ O (spread): The sky gets higher}

555
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:47,280
<i>Your hand,</i>

556
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,880
<i>My hand,</i>
{\ O (rank): Joe John}

557
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,980
<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>
{\ O (spread): The joy of being there}

558
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:06,080
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

559
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:14,180
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>
{\ O (spread): The wind is a little sweet}

560
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:22,280
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>
{\ O (spread): Joe John}

561
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
It’s already this late!
{\ O (gap): Elna}

562
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,280
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.
{\ O (spread): I'm short of words}

563
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Erina!
{\ O (rank): These feelings are overflowing}

564
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I’ll see you tomorrow!

565
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,530
Yes, JoJo!

566
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,780
Danny!

567
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,030
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>

568
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>

569
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,530
Hey!

570
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,780
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

571
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,030
I heard you were hanging
out with JoJo today.

572
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,280
Umm...

573
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
What do you...

574
00:38:45,280 --> 00:39:45,280
He...

575
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
He did it!

576
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,520
That’s our Dio!
{\ O (spread): My hands}

577
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,760
He does the things we’re too chicken
to, and with such confidence too!

578
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,000
I’ve got goosebumps!
I want to be just like him!

579
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

580
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You haven’t, have you?

581
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...

582
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It was me, Dio!

583
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

584
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Hey!

585
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
She’s—!
{\ O (spread): It's already this late}

586
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You bitch!
{\ O (spread): Because a customer is coming today}

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

588
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,666
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): Elna}

589
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:43,332
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): see you tomorrow}

590
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:51,000
Get up, bitch!

591
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What’re you sleeping for?

592
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!
{\ O (spread): That name of yours}

593
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

594
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hey, now go buy some booze!

595
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,250
Father, mother’s clearly not well!

596
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:02,500
She’s just fakin’ it!

597
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:02,750
Oi, you hear me?

598
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,000
-Stop it, Father!

599
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,250
Mum! Mum!

600
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:03,500
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

601
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:03,750
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

602
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,000
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!
{\ O (spread): I did it}

603
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,250
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

604
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:04,500
Please, you’ve got to get well!

605
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,750
<i>Dio...</i>

606
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

607
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,250
-Mum! Mum!

608
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:05,500
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

609
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,750
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!
{\ O (spread): Not yet}

610
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,000
But our money’s already—
{\ O (spread): My first partner wasn't JoJo.}

611
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Are you talking back?!

612
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?

613
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!

614
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,833
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?

615
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,666
Father!

616
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,499
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!
{\ O (spread): Are you deliberately washing it with mud?}

617
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:11,332
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!
{\ O (spread): Are you stupid?}

618
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:14,165
After all the trouble I went
through to nick that noble’s shit!
{\ O (spread): What are you sleeping for?}

619
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,000
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.
{\ O (spread): Why did they give me alcohol?}

620
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Why don’t I send him a letter...
{\ O (rank): Who do you think is helping you eat?}

621
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
No...

622
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You and I are different!
{\ O (rank): Now buy me some alcohol}

623
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,333

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I feel so miserable!

660

Erina! Did you say goodbye

663

Yes, Father.

664
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I’m sorry for imposing my career

Let’s go.

666
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I’ll make friends over there too.

667

Erina...

668
00:45:45,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I underestimated JoJo.

669
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
His explosive power...

670
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,333
His resilience...

671
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,666
I have to become stronger...

672
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,000
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

673
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I have to control my anger and stay calm...

674
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:46,500
So that I can take everything from him!

675
00:46:46,500 --> 00:47:05,000
However...

676
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What’s that noise?

677
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Could someone be
inside the incinerator?

678
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Are they trying to get out?!

679
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,500

You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

699

The one excavated from Mexico?

700
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
From Mexico, you say?

701
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It was quite a while ago...

A while?! Could you please clarify?

703

Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

704
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Uh-huh.
{\ O (spread): All the way from Italy?}

786
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Dio!
{\ O (spread): I think they said he was a northern aristocrat.}

787
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Can we write about your friendship
with JoJo for the school newspaper?
{\ O (gap): I'm just going to check the ledger,}

788
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,900
Thanks!

789
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,400
Let me get changed first.
{\ O (spread): Gratz.}

790
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,900
Shall we go home together?

791
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah.
{\ O (spread): The sun will soon set.}

792
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:23,400
<i>Time passed like the
endless flow of water</i>
{\ O (rank): You'd better not cross that street.}

793
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,400
<i>Ever since you started
calling him “Father”</i>

794
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,400
<i>I think of that word
which is so familiar to me</i>

795
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:45,400
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

796
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:52,400
<i>You’re... beautiful,
and a true gentleman</i>

797
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,400
<i>My friend, who’s always
pushing me to be better</i>

798
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,400
<i>You’ve repented for the
wrong you did to Erina</i>

799
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:21,400
<i>You’ve offered me a shoulder
to lean on, now that Danny’s gone</i>
{\ O (spread): Something is wrong. People are swaying in the river and being carried away.}

800
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>We walked this path
together for seven years</i>
{\ O (gap): Give me a warmth Kisaki Jack}

801
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>I always followed in your
footsteps, one step behind,</i>
{\ O (spread): Hate the poor, hate the rich,}

802
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:37,400
<i>So why is it that I don’t
feel any friendship for you?</i>
{\ O (rank): Let's all gather here now, Jack.}

803
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,400
How are you feeling?
{\ O (rank): In 1887, the Trafalda pair raised their voices in equality.}

804
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:51,766
Well, I’m old enough now that
a mere cold can last a long time.

805
00:54:51,766 --> 00:55:01,132
Sir, you’re not that old yet!

806
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:10,500
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!

807
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,500
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...

808
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,000
Seem to have won!

809
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Ah, Dio is a proper member
of the Joestar family now!

810
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.

811
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,500
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

812
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,500
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

813
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I...

814
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
I admire you! Back then—

815
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,000
My lord!

816
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,500
Yes?

817
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I’m home!
{\ O (rank): Joe Joe, your pass doesn't look like it.}

818
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,000
Dio! Welcome back!
Ah, and JoJo as well!
{\ O (spread): Try! We won the last game!}

819
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,500
Father!
{\ O (spread): Jo Jo! That was amazing!}

820
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Are you alright?

821
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I can’t get rid of this cough...

822
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Today, the doctor recommended
I be admitted to hospital.
{\ O (rank): Hey! Can I write about your friendship in the school newspaper?}

823
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,000
I object!
{\ O (spread): Thank you. Please go ahead and change and wait for me. Let's go home together.}

824
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,500
These days, hospitals
only care about profits!
{\ O (spread): Time passed like unsolicited water}

825
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
They say it’s a problem in London too.
{\ O (rank): Ever since you started calling me Dad}

826
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,500
It’s true...
{\ O (spread): I think of those words that have become familiar to me}

827
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,500
I feel safer at home.
{\ O (gap): Seven Years of Prefectural Production}

828
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,300
I give in.
{\ O (spread): You were beautiful and sincere}

829
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,100
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.
{\ O (spread): I straighten my collar, thinking of my friend}

830
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,900
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!
{\ O (spread): You regretted your mistake of not wearing your collar.}

831
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,700
What?!
{\ O (spread): In place of Tani, you supported me}

832
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,500
What?!

833
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
You already know?
{\ O (rank): We walked together for seven years}

834
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:33,500
How?
{\ O (spread): But why don't I feel any friendship towards you?}

835
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Inspector Archer here told me.
{\ O (rank): How are you feeling thanks?}

836
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
How rude of you, inspector!
{\ O (gap): Just the wind has come this far}

837
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,000
Huh?
{\ O (spread): If this is taking so long, I'm getting old.}

838
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,500
We...
{\ O (spread): It's still today}

839
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,500
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...

840
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,500
So we rushed home!
{\ O (spread): Jojo and Dio Plant, they won.}

841
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Oh no, silly me!
{\ O (spread): Dio is already a member of the Joestar family.}

842
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,500
I truly am proud.
{\ O (spread): Jojo has become a fine gentleman.}

843
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,500
I have such wonderful sons.
{\ O (gap): He submitted a brilliant thesis in the field of high school studies.}

844
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Especially you, Dio.
{\ O (gap): Dio graduated with the highest grades in law.}

845
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
You’ve worked so very hard.
{\ O (spread): I respect you}

846
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,500
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.
{\ O (spread): Back then...}

847
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,000
I was born poor...
{\ O (spread): Husband}

848
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,500
But you gave me a chance.
{\ O (spread): I just got home}

849
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Thank you.
{\ O (rank): Dio, welcome home}

850
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Well then, I’ll be off.
{\ O (spread): And Jojo too}

851
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.
{\ O (rank): Dad, are you okay?}

852
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,500
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.
{\ O (spread): The seats don't stop}

853
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,500
But this is Liverpool!
{\ O (rank): Today the doctor recommended I be admitted to hospital.}

854
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:49,500
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.
{\ O (spread): I'm against it.}

855
00:57:49,500 --> 00:58:01,500
Now, if you’ll pardon me.
{\ O (spread): Hospitals these days are all about making money.}

856
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:13,500
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...
{\ O (spread): Apparently it's a problem in London too.}

857
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Who on earth made this...
{\ O (rank): It's certainly safer at home}

858
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
And for what reason?

859
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,500
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

860
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,500
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

861
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:39,500
This is...
{\ O (spread): Oh, you already know that?}

862
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Dario Brando?
{\ O (rank): Inspector Archer there told me.}

863
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,750
Thank you again, Master Dio—
{\ O (spread): That's terrible, Inspector.}

864
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, it’s the least I could do.
{\ O (spread): We want to see our father's happy face}

865
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,250
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.
{\ O (spread): Even though he came flying}

866
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,500
“Right now... I’m sick.”
{\ O (spread): Damn}

867
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
“I’ll probably die.”
{\ O (gap): Really big nose}

868
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,700
“My heart hurts,”
{\ O (spread): They are wonderful sons.}

869
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,900
“My hands shake,”
{\ O (spread): Especially D.O., you did really well.}

870
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,100
“And I can’t stop coughing.”
{\ O (spread): When you graduate, you can be whatever you want to be.}

871
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,300
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): He gave me a chance even though I was born poor.}

872
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,500
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): thank you}

873
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,500
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

874
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,500
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>
{\ O (rank): Thank you for always coming, Inspector.}

875
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>
{\ O (spread): With the appearance of Jack the Ripper, the world has become a dangerous place.}

876
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,500
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>
{\ O (spread): No, this is Liverpool.}

877
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,500
<i>I endured no matter what</i>
{\ O (spread): There are people everywhere who lack the sense of right and wrong like him.}

878
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,500
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>
{\ O (gap): Well then, excuse me.}

879
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,540
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!
{\ O (spread): …}

880
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,580
I know!

881
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,620
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!
{\ O (spread): Who on earth did this and for what purpose?}

882
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,660
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>
{\ O (spread): If we can solve this mystery, it might spark something new in the Japanese Language Society.}

883
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,700
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>
{\ O (spread): If that happens, then there must be some destiny for this stone that my mother bought.}

884
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,000
I don’t bloody need it anymore!
{\ O (rank): This is Dario Pland}

885
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

886
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>

887
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

888
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

889
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,454
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

890
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:33,908
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>
{\ O (spread): You'll probably die.}

891
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:39,362
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

892
01:00:39,362 --> 01:00:44,816
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>
{\ O (spread): Can't you hear me?}

893
01:00:44,816 --> 01:00:50,270
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>
{\ O (spread): A voice calling you}

894
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:55,724
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>
{\ O (spread): My mother died, and my father and I}

895
01:00:55,724 --> 01:01:01,178
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>
{\ O (spread): Yes, whatever happens with that scum}

896
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:06,632
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>
{\ O (spread): I have endured}

897
01:01:06,632 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): Yes, until that day}

898
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:17,540
Dio!

899
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:23,000
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

900
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What’s the matter, JoJo?

901
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

902
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.
{\ O (spread): I don't need it anymore}

903
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Huh?
{\ O (spread): My mother was killed by him, and everything was taken from her.}

904
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Show me that.
{\ O (spread): Can you endure it, Tia?}

905
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.
{\ O (spread): Your blood flows through my body in this hell}

906
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

907
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What is this non—

908
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Answer me!

909
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

910
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

911
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
JoJo...

912
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,

913
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then you doubt our very friendship.

914
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Dio,

915
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
As a gentleman,

916
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.
{\ O (spread): What's wrong Jojo?}

917
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
If you can swear on your father’s honour,
{\ O (spread): A letter from your father seven years ago.}

918
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I’ll never speak of this again.

919
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Swear on that guy?

920
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Dio,

921
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Swear on it.

922
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,500
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!

923
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,000
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!

924
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,500
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!
{\ O (spread): Answer me}

925
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,000
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!
{\ O (spread): What on earth are you trying to say?}

926
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Give me the medicine back!
{\ O (gap): Let me check this medicine}

927
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

928
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I’m convinced now...
{\ O (spread): To examine this drug}

929
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!
{\ O (spread): to doubt our friendship}

930
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I’ll protect the Joestar family.
{\ O (gap): Tia}

931
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!
{\ O (gap): I swear to you in all sincerity and on the honor of your father, Mr. Brand.}

932
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Just a misunderstanding...
{\ O (gap): My own innocence}

933
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,666
Besides...
{\ O (spread): I swear to my father I'll never talk about this again}

934
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,332
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?
{\ O (spread): I swear to him}

935
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:08,000
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

936
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes,

937
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,666
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

938
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,332
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

939
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:18,000
JoJo! JoJo!!

940
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
JoJo...

941
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is something the matter, Master Dio?

942
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
No...

943
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,600
I’m alright...
{\ O (spread): Give me back that medicine}

944
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,200
<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

945
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,800
It’s too late to turn back now.
{\ O (spread): I won't let you near my father anymore.}

946
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,400
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>
{\ O (spread): Changed to the core}

947
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,000
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): We never had a friendship from the start}

948
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Father!
{\ O (rank): I will protect JoJo}

949
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!
{\ O (rank): It's a misunderstanding, JoJo}

950
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-Father!
{\ O (rank): It's a misunderstanding}

951
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
What’s all this ruckus for?
{\ O (spread): And}

952
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Father...
{\ O (spread): There's no evidence.}

953
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I’m going to London
for two or three days.
{\ O (gap): It's just a guess}

954
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.
{\ O (spread): yes}

955
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Please don’t accept any care
or medicine from anyone else.
{\ O (gap): I hated my father}

956
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,500
Excuse me, but—
{\ O (spread): Above all, I was suspicious}

957
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,000
We’ll do as he says.

958
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don’t know what’s going on...
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

959
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But I trust my son!
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

960
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Thank you, Father.

961
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Seven years ago, this thing...
{\ O (spread): What did you do, Tia?}

962
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It moved in reaction to my blood.
{\ O (rank): no}

963
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,857
With this...

964
01:04:44,857 --> 01:04:54,714
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

965
01:04:54,714 --> 01:05:04,571
JoJo...

966
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:14,428
Your own research...

967
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:24,285
Will be the death of you!

968
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:34,142
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>
{\ O (spread): father}

969
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:44,000
<i>Turning my eyes to the stars
and praying for an antidote</i>
{\ O (spread): What's going on, JoJo?}

970
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
<i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>

971
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
<i>Now I’ve arrived here
in this town steeped in mud</i>
{\ O (spread): father}

972
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
<i>Ogre Street, the place
where plagues are born</i>
{\ O (spread): I'm going to London for a couple of days.}

973
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>
{\ O (spread): Meanwhile, the doctors I hired}

974
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>

975
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
<i>Even if I were to lose
this right hand of mine</i>
{\ O (gap): Except from them}

976
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,200
<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>
{\ O (spread): Please do not take this as medicine or tia.}

977
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:08,400
<i>At long last our meeting takes place</i>

978
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:08,600
<i>There’s a scent in the air
and it smells like prey</i>
{\ O (spread): Let me do what I want}

979
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:08,800
<i>Sniffing you out through the
storm someone’s making his way</i>
{\ O (spread): I don't know why}

980
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,000
<i>It’s time for your
leader to take the stage</i>
{\ O (spread): I}

981
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,200
<i>(Ogre Street, we devour anything we can)</i>

982
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,400
<i>(Ogre Street, here everything meets its end)</i>
{\ O (spread): father}

983
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:09,600
<i>Dunno what the hell
you came here for</i>
{\ O (spread): thank you}

984
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:09,800
<i>Bet you thought you
stood a good chance, huh?</i>

985
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,000
<i>In a moment we’ll
devour all that hope</i>

986
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
<i>This is Ogre Street and
we’re the ogres, duh!</i>
{\ O (rank): It reacted to my blood and activated}

987
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
<i>Got no problem with you bein’ naïve,
I’m just showin’ you the simple reality</i>

988
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
<i>Hey hey hey,
how about it, rich boy?</i>

989
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
<i>Want a taste of the
edge of this knife?</i>

990
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,000
<i>We’re gonna strip you of all that you got
Put up a fight and your life will be lost</i>

991
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
<i>This is Ogre Street!
Ain’t it obvious that we’d cheat?</i>

992
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
<i>Us have-nots are gonna
steal your riches away!</i>
{\ O (spread): Aiming for the end of the world, East End of London}

993
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
<i>From your life to that foolish
heart—we’ll steal ‘em away!</i>
{\ O (spread): This place I followed is in the mud}

994
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
<i>Tail between your legs, you can
save your own skin by runnin’ away!</i>
{\ O (spread): Augustus Golito, where the plague comes}

995
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
{\an8}Is this guy insane?!
{\ O (spread): This place in front of me is the other side of the world}

996
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
<i>(Ogre Street, go on and leave it all behind)</i>
{\ O (spread): There's a reason we need to move forward}

997
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
{\an8}<i>I don’t care if I lose four fingers!</i>
{\ O (rank): Even if you lose this right hand, look at the stars}

998
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,615
<i>(Ogre Street, we’ll even fill
our stomachs with your life)</i>

999
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:25,230
<i>I came here for a reason!</i>
{\ O (spread): This is me and the smell}

1000
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:30,845
<i>You said you’re fine with
losing four fingers, hah?</i>

1001
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:36,460
<i>(Ogre Street, why don’t we
put that resolve to the test?)</i>

1002
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:42,075
Hold on! I only came here
looking for a poison seller!

1003
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:47,690
Quit bluffin’! Let me have a
go at this soft little rich boy!

1004
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:53,305
That’s the sound of blade hitting bone!

1005
01:07:53,305 --> 01:07:58,920
<i>Made the mistake of my life, pickin’
a fight with this fearless tough guy</i>

1006
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,535
<i>Countdown to my final breath—</i>

1007
01:08:04,535 --> 01:08:10,150
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1008
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,765
Stop, everyone!

1009
01:08:15,765 --> 01:08:21,380
I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!

1010
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:27,000
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?

1011
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I came here for the sake of my father.

1012
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So in the moment I kicked,

1013
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.

1014
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.

1015
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Tell me your name!

1016
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Jonathan Joestar.

1017
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,333
Mr. Joestar, if you’re looking
for poison, that’d be Wang Chan.

1018
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,666
Be careful, he’s a crafty one!

1019
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,000
Someone bandage his wound.

1020
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I, Speedwagon, will lead you to his shop!

1021
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why?!

1022
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
‘Cause I’ve taken a liking to ya!

1023
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
<i>(Ogre Street)</i>

1024
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,333
<i>With your determination to fight</i>
{\ O (spread): I don't mind losing this finger}

1025
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:24,666
<i>(Ogre Street, you’ve lit in
us a glowing guiding light)</i>

1026
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:29,000
<i>(You, who have the courage)</i>

1027
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
<i>(To see the stars down here in the mud)</i>

1028
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
<i>(Light up the darkness with
your unwavering heart!)</i>

1029
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,846
<i>Your refreshing sunlight</i>

1030
01:09:49,846 --> 01:09:55,692
<i>Brought me completely to my knees</i>

1031
01:09:55,692 --> 01:10:01,538
<i>This must be some
strange twist of fate!</i>

1032
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:07,384
<i>Let’s toast—to our meeting!</i>

1033
01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:13,230
JoJo...

1034
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:19,076
JoJo...!

<i>Dio...</i>

1036
01:10:24,922 --> 01:10:30,768
JoJo has gone off to London...

1037
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:36,614
Could he have died a dog’s death already?

1038
01:10:36,614 --> 01:10:42,460
<i>Dio...</i>

1039
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:48,306
Or could he have found
evidence of the medicine?

1040
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:54,152
Which is it?!

1041
01:10:54,152 --> 01:11:00,000
<i>Dio...</i>

1042
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Booze! I can’t help but drink!

1043
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>
{\ O (rank): I came here for my father.}

1044
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>
{\ O (rank): That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.}

1045
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
-Shut up, get out of my head!

1046
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
<i>You’re the only one I care about</i>

1047
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
<i>Become the richest man!</i>

1048
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,500
-You piece of shit, we’re not the same!

1049
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,000
Watch where you’re going, twat!
{\ O (spread): That's why Kelsion doesn't want to do anything that would cause your father grief.}

1050
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Oi, are you listening, you stupid brat?
{\ O (rank): Tell me your name.}

1051
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,133
You should ask yer mum to hold
you by the hand next time!
{\ O (spread): Jora, Joestar.}

1052
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:27,266

{\ O (spread): Joestar-san, please name the person playing the German role.}

1053
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:27,399
Didn’t you hear me?
{\ O (spread): Be careful. They're tricky. Hey, treat your wounds.}

1054
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:27,532
Oi! You piece of shit—
{\ O (spread): This Speed ​​Burgon will guide you to Minsei.}

{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:28,197
How dare you! You bastard!
{\ O (spread): Foca Street}

1060
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:28,330
What did you do to my mate?!
{\ O (spread): Continue taking a look}

1061

{\an8}<i>One man’s misfortune...</i>
{\ O (spread): You who see the stars in your heart}

01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:28,729
{\an8}<i>Is another man’s fortune!</i>

1064
01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:28,862
Interesting, this is a good
opportunity to try it out!
{\ O (spread): Light up the darkness}

01:11:28,862 --> 01:11:29,000
{\an8}<i>You’re my clever boy!</i>

1066
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
What’re you mumbling about?!

1067
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It’s a live human experiment!

{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
What—

1074
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,000
{\an8}<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

1075
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What is this light?

1076
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Was I hallucinating?

1077
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
He’s dead...

1078
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,500
The spikes pierced so deep into his skull,
it must have killed him instantly.

1079
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,000
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.
{\ O (spread): I can't help but drink alcohol}

1080
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
He’s not dead!

Fangs?! What is he?!

01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,250
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>
{\ O (spread): Shut up and don't come out}

1083
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:09,500
He’s sucking my blood!
{\ O (spread): You are the only one who can see the sun}

1084
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:17,750
His face is...
{\ O (spread): Become the richest}

1085
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:26,000
Becoming younger?!
{\ O (spread): The case is different between you and me}

1086
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,860
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!
{\ O (gap): Where am I looking, Tanchiki?}

1087
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:43,930
I was saved...
{\ O (spread): Nyahaha are you listening to this?}

1088
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:56,000
By the sunlight...

1089
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
He turned into ash...
{\ O (rank): When you go out,}

1090
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,500
Ow!

1091
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:24,000
So this...

1092
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1093
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,333
So, where is Dio?

1094
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:32,666
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1095
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:36,000
I’ll call for reinforcements right away.

1096
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Please use the foyer.

1097
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Thank you.

1098
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
-You there!
-Sir!

1099
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1100
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yes sir!

1101
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,333
Oi, come on!

1102
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,666
JoJo...

1103
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:53,000
I apologise.
{\ O (spread): Human experimentation}

1104
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This is my cross to bear.
{\ O (rank): JoeJoe}

1105
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,066
What?
{\ O (spread): I'll solve your research}

1106
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:55,132
If only I had made sure
that man was exiled...
{\ O (spread): What}

1107
01:14:55,132 --> 01:14:55,198
Dio’s father...
{\ O (spread): What}

1108
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:55,264
Dario Brando.

1109
01:14:55,264 --> 01:14:55,330
What do you mean?
{\ O (spread): Hallucination?}

1110
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:55,396
I’ll tell you about it.
{\ O (spread): Dead}

1111
01:14:55,396 --> 01:14:55,462
This happened when you were a baby.
{\ O (spread): If you get stabbed in the head with this much force, it's only natural that you'll die instantly.}

1112
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:55,528
This is certainly my ring,
{\ O (spread): It's an ancient instrument of torture and murder.}

1113
01:14:55,528 --> 01:14:55,594
But I never reported a theft.
{\ O (spread): Not dead}

1114
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:55,660
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.
{\ O (spread): Hiba, what is this guy?}

1115
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:55,726
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1116
01:14:55,726 --> 01:14:55,792
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1117
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:55,858
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1118
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:55,924
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,

1119
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,000
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1120
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I...
{\ O (rank): I hate that the sun I see is the last one I see!}

1121
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,660
I arrested the criminal!
{\ O (spread): Thank goodness...}

1122
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:58,320
Would you like to see for yourself?
{\ O (spread): Did the sunlight turn it to ash?}

1123
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,980
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1124
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,640
He’s certain to be exiled!

1125
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,300
I see.

1126
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:00,960
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1127
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:01,620
Brando?!

1128
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,280
Oh, bollocks.

1129
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:02,940
Then that means—
{\ O (spread): The power of the Stone Mask...}

1130
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,600
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,
{\ O (spread): So Dio...}

1131
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,260
But a thief!
{\ O (spread): He hasn't returned from the liquor store yet.}

1132
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:04,920
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.
{\ O (spread): Quickly chase after them...}

1133
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,580
Why?
{\ O (spread): Please use the room}

1134
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:06,240
I...
{\ O (spread): thank you}

1135
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:06,900
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.
{\ O (spread): Hey!}

1136
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,500
Did he tell you...
{\ O (gap): Ah...}

1137
01:15:09,500 --> 01:16:40,900
That I gave him this ring?

1138
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,700
Yes, he said that. A lie!
{\ O (rank): yes!}

1139
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,800
It’s not a lie.
{\ O (gap): Hahahaha...}

1140
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,100
This is what I gave him.
{\ O (gap): Hahahaha...}

1141
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,500
He is innocent.
{\ O (gap): long…}

1142
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,300
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1143
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,400
Mr. Brando,
{\ O (rank): This is my fault...}

1144
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,800
This is yours.

1145
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,100
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.
{\ O (rank): I…}

1146
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1147
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1148
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,700
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>

1149
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,700
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>
{\ O (rank): I'll tell you}

1150
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,200
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>

1151
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
Thank you, sir!

1152
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,000
You are too good-natured!

1153
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,900
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!

1154
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,800
That may be true,

1155
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
But think about it the other way around.

1156
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:26,800
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>

1157
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,800
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>

1158
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,800
<i>That pain</i>

1159
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:46,800
<i>Everything is connected</i>

1160
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:55,300
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1161
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:03,800
<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>

1162
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:12,300
I can’t see stars or nothin’!
That’s bollocks!

1163
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:20,800
That’s why...

1164
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:29,800
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1165
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:35,000
<i>That this gold I’ve passed on</i>

1166
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,200
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1167
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:45,400
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>

1168
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,600
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1169
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,800
Inspector.

1170
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
I’ll wait for Dio.

1171
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
He can still be stopped.

1172
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1173
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.

1174
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then...

1175
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.

1176
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...
{\ O (rank): Yes, I said}

1177
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:54,000
<i>It’s a wedge driven into
the wasteland of my memory</i>

1178
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>
{\ O (rank): It's not a lie}

1179
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:17,000
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>
{\ O (spread): This is what I gave to him}

1180
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>
{\ O (rank): He is innocent}

1181
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,076
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>
{\ O (spread): It's one half of your wife.}

1182
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:21,152
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>
{\ O (spread): Brand-san}

1183
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,228
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1184
01:21:21,228 --> 01:21:21,304
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>
{\ O (spread): This is yours}

1185
01:21:21,304 --> 01:21:21,380
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>
{\ O (spread): Please give this ring to me and buy something for your family.}

1186
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:21,456
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”
{\ O (spread): Lord Joster, why did you do that?}

1187
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:21,532
There’s a saying that goes like that.
{\ O (spread): If I were suffering in poverty}

1188
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:21,608
The Stone Mask...
{\ O (spread): I would have done the same}

1189
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:21,684
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1190
01:21:21,684 --> 01:21:21,760
I, Dio, was...

1191
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:21,836
Shit...
{\ O (spread): The stars in the sky are attracted to each other}

1192
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:21,912
JoJo...

1193
01:21:21,912 --> 01:21:22,000
I see you’ve returned from London—
{\ O (spread): This light will clear the darkness}

1194
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I have the antidote now.

1195
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:50,500
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.
{\ O (spread): thank you}

1196
01:21:50,500 --> 01:22:15,000
It truly hurts me.
{\ O (spread): You are too kind}

1197
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:39,500
Although you might not believe me,
{\ O (spread): This villain is laughing inside}

1198
01:22:39,500 --> 01:23:04,000
Those are my true feelings.
{\ O (spread): Maybe so}

1199
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I understand, JoJo.
{\ O (rank): But think the other way around.}

1200
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:14,000
You’re honest like that.
{\ O (spread): From the music of destiny, people reach out to the stars}

1201
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—
{\ O (rank): Let's embrace that courage, that loneliness}

1202
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
The final one
I will ask of you.
{\ O (spread): Pain is all connected}

1203
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Can you give me more time?

1204
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Time—

1205
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
To turn myself in to the police.

1206
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Eh?

1207
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I...

1208
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,400
R-Regret the choices I’ve
made throughout my life.

1209
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:48,800
Because I was born into squalor...
{\ O (spread): I'm ready to keep believing}

1210
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:55,200
My ambition was relentless.

1211
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:01,600
What I did was terrible!
{\ O (spread): I'm waiting for D.}

1212
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:08,000
I want to repent for my sins!
{\ O (spread): It can still be stopped}

1213
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Don’t believe a word he says!

1214
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1215
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Allow me to introduce myself!
{\ O (rank): - I heard a strange rumor.}

1216
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I’m Speedwagon, the meddler!

1217
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,400
Growing up in the darkest slums,
{\ O (spread): - He reportedly broke the wall with his bare hands.}

1218
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,800
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.
{\ O (spread): - And then the man, in the morning sun,}

1219
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,200
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.
{\ O (spread): - It won't fit.}

1220
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,600
This guy reeks!

1221
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,000
Worse than vomit!
{\ O (spread): - It's the same as 30 years ago.}

1222
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
He was born evil!
{\ O (gap): - Just like back then.}

1223
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,782
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1224
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:54,564
This man has confessed already.
{\ O (spread): - A smashed grass fire.}

1225
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:57,346
Father...
{\ O (spread): - That sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean}

1226
01:24:57,346 --> 01:25:00,128
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1227
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,910
I will return to my bed to rest.

1228
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,692
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.
{\ O (spread): - I'm fascinated by the world of roads.}

1229
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:08,474
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...
{\ O (spread): - My respected father,}

1230
01:25:08,474 --> 01:25:11,256
He was born with an innate destiny.
{\ O (spread): - Crossed the seven seas.}

1231
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:14,040
Silence!
{\ O (spread): - Dear Father and Mother,}

1232
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,880
Come on—

1233
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,512
JoJo, I understand!

1234
01:25:22,512 --> 01:25:28,144
Arrest me.

1235
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:33,776
But, if it’s not too much to ask;

1236
01:25:33,776 --> 01:25:39,408
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1237
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:45,040
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1238
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,720
Be careful!

1239
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,040
Agreed.

1240
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,240
I will handcuff you.

1241
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,640
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1242
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:08,140
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1243
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:13,640
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1244
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,640
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1245
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,473
What’re you talking about?

1246
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:28,306
<i>You know, JoJo...</i>

1247
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:33,139
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1248
01:26:33,139 --> 01:26:37,972
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1249
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:42,805
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1250
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:47,640
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1251
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>
{\ O (rank): - I understand, girl.}

1252
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,140
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>
{\ O (spread): - That's the kind of guy you are.}

1253
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,640
<i>That murky sky up there,</i>
{\ O (spread): - I know this is selfish, but I have a favor to ask.}

1254
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,640
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>
{\ O (gap): - This is the last one.}

1255
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,640
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>
{\ O (spread): - Can you give me some time?}

1256
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,640
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>
{\ O (spread): - To the police,}

1257
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,640
<i>That’s why, now is the time</i>
{\ O (spread): - Time for independence.}

1258
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:16,640
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>
{\ O (rank): - I,}

1259
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:16,640
<i>And seize...</i>

1260
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,640
<i>The stars!</i>

1261
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,230
The Stone Mask?

1262
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:22,820
<i>I...</i>

1263
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,410
<i>I...</i>

1264
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,000
<i>Reject...</i>

1265
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:24,590
<i>My humanity!</i>
{\ O (spread): - Don't believe it.}

1266
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:25,180
<i>JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread): - His words.}

1267
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:25,770
Stop!

1268
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:26,360
-JoJo!
-Father!

1269
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:26,950
Dio!
{\ O (spread): - Let me introduce myself.}

1270
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:27,540
Dio!
{\ O (spread): - I'm Speed ​​Oagon, the busybody.}

1271
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:28,130
Shoot him!

1272
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:28,720
Shoot him!

1273
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:29,310
Lord Joestar!

1274
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:29,900
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

1275
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:30,490
Father! Father!

1276
01:27:30,490 --> 01:27:31,080
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): - This guy is born evil.}

1277
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:31,670
This is...

1278
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:32,260
Your late mother’s ring.

1279
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:32,850
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1280
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:33,440
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

1281
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,030
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...
{\ O (spread): My son}

1282
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:34,640
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.

1283
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Father...

1284
01:27:36,640 --> 01:28:18,640
It’s not so bad...

1285
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,640
JoJo...

1286
01:28:20,640 --> 01:29:22,640
To die...
{\ O (spread): Be careful why}

1287
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:47,640
In my son’s arms.
{\ O (gap): Got it}

1288
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,140
Father?
{\ O (spread): I'll put the handcuffs on}

1289
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,640
How could this be...
{\ O (spread): Humans have limitations}

1290
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,640
I knew I made a mistake, back then.
{\ O (gap): I've figured it out}

1291
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,000
Now he’s dead and there’s
no bringing him back.
{\ O (spread): The more Oro blooms, the more}

1292
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Mr. Joestar...
{\ O (rank): The limits of life}

1293
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1294
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:19,000
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1295
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1296
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,333
<i>Even though you said you believed me!</i>

1297
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:37,666
<i>I couldn’t protect you—
How could I be so powerless?</i>

1298
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:44,000
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>
{\ O (spread): My eyes are closed}

1299
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
<i>Father, open your eyes!</i>
{\ O (gap): Do you understand that murky sky?}

1300
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
<i>What’s pride worth now?</i>
{\ O (spread): These hands are crushing me, they can't reach me}

1301
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>
{\ O (gap): This beautiful blood that has been JoJo}

1302
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body?</i>
{\ O (gap): Even after vomiting, this blood won't go away}

1303
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:10,000
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>
{\ O (spread): So now is the time to break this cage}

1304
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,000
<i>Carrying yourself with
discipline and pride</i>
{\ O (spread): Catch the Stars}

1305
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1306
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:33,000
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>
{\ O (spread): Mother}

1307
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1308
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:46,000
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1309
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
<i>It will become the future,
sent up to the stars</i>

1310
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1311
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
<i>Everything is connected,
there’s a meaning to it all</i>

1312
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:15,000
<i>I’ll fight against this fate,
keep sorrow at bay</i>

1313
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1314
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1315
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What’s wrong?
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

1316
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
The body... Dio’s body is gone!

1317
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What?!

1318
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What did you say?!

1319
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Oi copper, get away from the window!

1320
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Inspector!

1321
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1322
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1323
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!
{\ O (spread): Gradually, the end came in my son's arms.}

1324
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Dio!
{\ O (spread): Oh my god}

1325
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Stop!
{\ O (spread): It was definitely a mistake back then}

1326
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!
{\ O (spread): When you die, everything}

1327
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads
or tails of what’s happening!
{\ O (spread): Damn it, Mr. Joestar}

1328
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I was always told to be sincere.}

1329
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Can you hear my voice?
{\ O (spread): Always proudly}

1330
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
H-He’s sucking his blood!
{\ O (spread): I said I'd save you}

1331
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You’re—
{\ O (spread): I was told I believed}

1332
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you}

1333
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I’ve gained such incredible power!
{\ O (spread): What is sincerity?}

1334
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
From the Stone Mask...
{\ O (spread): Dad, open your chest}

1335
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
From your father’s blood!
{\ O (spread): What are you proud of?}

1336
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Dio!
{\ O (spread): What's the purpose}

1337
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
These monsters are
making <i>more</i> monsters?!
{\ O (spread): The Joestar blood that flows through my body}

1338
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!
{\ O (spread): Always remained sincere}

1339
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That monster is too bloody strong!
{\ O (spread): Be proud and understand yourself}

1340
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
The brain!
{\ O (spread): Ready to cut through the dark wilderness}

1341
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!
{\ O (spread): Look up at the stars and accept it all}

1342
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
If that’s the case...
{\ O (rank): Engrave this will in your mind}

1343
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,125
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!
{\ O (spread): Be proud of your heart and shine golden}

1344
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:44,250
Stop!
{\ O (spread): Let's become the future and send it to the stars}

1345
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:48,375
Speedwagon!
{\ O (spread): The Joestar blood that flows through my body}

1346
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:52,500
I must...
{\ O (spread): Everything is connected and everything has meaning}

1347
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,625
I must make my will stronger!
{\ O (spread): Resisting this fate and sadness}

1348
01:32:56,625 --> 01:33:00,750
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): A single drop of courage}

1349
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:04,875
Weak! So weak!
{\ O (spread): Police work is tough}

1350
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:09,000
Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread): what up}

1351
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Let me...
{\ O (rank): That's the corpse}

1352
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,466
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1353
01:33:14,466 --> 01:33:18,932
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1354
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:23,398
JoJo...

1355
01:33:23,398 --> 01:33:27,864
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1356
01:33:27,864 --> 01:33:32,330
I told you, didn’t I?

1357
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,796
No matter how many
tricks you come up with,

1358
01:33:36,796 --> 01:33:41,262
Humans have limits!

1359
01:33:41,262 --> 01:33:45,728
Quit hiding behind that
curtain! Come out here!

1360
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:50,194
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1361
01:33:50,194 --> 01:33:54,660
Dio!

1362
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:59,126
This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!

1363
01:33:59,126 --> 01:34:03,592
It’s courage!
{\ O (spread): Shoot me}

1364
01:34:03,592 --> 01:34:08,058
This fire won’t kill him.

1365
01:34:08,058 --> 01:34:12,524
Speedwagon, escape from the mansion.

1366
01:34:12,524 --> 01:34:17,000
What?

1367
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Mr. Joestar!

1368
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,022
Don’t run upstairs!

1369
01:34:23,022 --> 01:34:28,044
<i>(The flash of flames,
illuminating the dark)</i>

<i>Come, Dio.</i>

01:34:33,066 --> 01:34:38,088
<i>I’m up here.</i>

1372
01:34:38,088 --> 01:34:43,110
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1373
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:48,132
<i>Very well, I’ll take care of you first</i>

1374
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:53,154
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1375
01:34:53,154 --> 01:34:58,176
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>

1376
01:34:58,176 --> 01:35:03,198
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1377
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:08,220
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>
{\ O (spread): Run, Mr. Josser.}

<i>(The flames are pulsing)</i>

1379
01:35:13,242 --> 01:35:18,264
<i>JOJO: Father! I’ll mourn you

<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:38,352
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

<i>My youth was with you</i>

<i>It’s time for us to say goodbye to it</i>

<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

<i>I’ll let that burn to ash too.
I’ll stop you, Dio!</i>

1391
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

1392
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,400
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

1393
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,400
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

1394
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:49,400
The fire had already engulfed the
mansion, even overtaking the roof.

1395
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (rank): Oh, JoJo}

1396
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:33,400
This body is immortal.

1397
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:33,400
The only one dying will be you!

1398
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:45,400
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1399
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,650
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1400
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:47,900
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1401
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,150
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1402
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,400
-JoJo!

1403
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,400
<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

1404
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,400
The knife you stabbed Father with!

1405
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
It’s useless! I’m immortal!

1406
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,046
<i>With this final bit of strength</i>

1407
01:40:01,046 --> 01:40:03,692
{\an8}<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1408
01:40:03,692 --> 01:40:06,340
{\an8}<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1409
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:11,220
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1410
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:37,813
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1411
01:40:37,813 --> 01:41:04,406
<i>This can’t be how my life ends—</i>

1412
01:41:04,406 --> 01:41:31,000
JoJo!!

1413
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Can you hear me?

1414
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,060
You can hear me.

1415
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,120
Good.

1416
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:33,180
I hope you had a nice intermission.

1417
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:33,240
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,
{\ O (spread): Jojo, the Joestar mansion burns down}

1418
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:33,300
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.
{\ O (spread): Under the map, everything is lost}

1419
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:33,360
And so that we can continue our
<i>show</i> of love for these characters.
{\ O (spread): Burn everything except this life}

1420
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:33,420
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.
{\ O (spread): I'll finish you}

1421
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:33,480
Just a few more until it’s complete!
{\ O (spread): This is what Joestar must be thinking}

1422
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:33,540
I hope you get the merch
you’re looking for too.
{\ O (spread): The stronger the firepower, the more the monster's recovery power can't keep up.}

1423
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:33,600
Well, let’s continue where we left off.
{\ O (spread): More, more firepower}

1424
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:33,660
The story up to this point
seems like a bit of a fairytale, but...
{\ O (spread): But the flames have reached the roof}

1425
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:33,720
Make no mistake, it’s the truth.
{\ O (spread): Damn it, Mr. Joestar}

1426
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:33,780
Things are going to get more
and more bizarre from here on out.

1427
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:33,840
Yes.

1428
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:33,900
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.
{\ O (spread): This body is immortal, you are the only one who will die.}

1429
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:33,960
Previously, the mansion was
shrouded in flames and burnt down...
{\ O (spread): How the goddess of Jillary shines}

1430
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,020
But Mr. Joestar survived.
{\ O (spread): Give me loving judgment in your heart}

1431
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,080
He beat Dio,
{\ O (spread): I won't let go of this knife}

1432
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,140
But lost everything.
{\ O (spread): You're closed off, it's a knife.}

1433
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:34,200
Three days later...
{\ O (spread): It's no use, I'm immortal}

1434
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:34,260
I found it!
{\ O (spread): Jillary}

1435
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:34,320
The mask that man wore!
{\ O (spread): The power of hell}

1436
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:34,380
If I have this mask—
{\ O (spread): The Goddess of Giving Love Sways in Flames}

1437
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:34,440
<i>JoJo...</i>

1438
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:34,500
<i>JoJo...</i>

1439
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:34,560
<i>JoJo...</i>

1440
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:34,620
<i>JoJo...</i>

1441
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:34,680
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

1442
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:34,740
<i>My voice calling for you?</i>

1443
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:34,800
After carrying the unconscious Mr. Joestar
to the hospital, I came back to visit him!

1444
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:34,860
I’m not much,
{\ O (spread): I can hear you}

1445
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:34,920
But I want to do what I can at least,

1446
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:35,000
To give him some small
hope to keep on living!

1447
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Can I help you?

1448
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:43,833
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

1449
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:50,666
But that’s why I’m here!

1450
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:57,499
I’m doing enough for him as his nurse.

1451
01:41:57,499 --> 01:42:04,332
Please come back some other day.

1452
01:42:04,332 --> 01:42:11,165
Is he alright?! Oi, hold it—

1453
01:42:11,165 --> 01:42:17,998
<i>JoJo...</i>

1454
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:24,831
<i>JoJo...</i>

1455
01:42:24,831 --> 01:42:31,664
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1456
01:42:31,664 --> 01:42:38,497
<i>My voice,</i>

1457
01:42:38,497 --> 01:42:45,330
<i>You recognise it, right?</i>

1458
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:52,163
<i>From that bright, fleeting moment
when we were drawn together</i>

1459
01:42:52,163 --> 01:42:58,996
<i>I want to hear your voice again too</i>

1460
01:42:58,996 --> 01:43:05,829
Where am I...?

1461
01:43:05,829 --> 01:43:12,662
You slept for three whole days!

1462
01:43:12,662 --> 01:43:19,495
The mansion! Everyone is—

1463
01:43:19,495 --> 01:43:26,328
Please, just relax for now!

1464
01:43:26,328 --> 01:43:33,161
You’ve made it through the worst
of it, but you’re still in bad shape!

1465
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:39,994
I’m so glad you’re alive!

1466
01:43:39,994 --> 01:43:46,827
Have you been caring
for me this whole—

1467
01:43:46,827 --> 01:43:53,660
You’re—

1468
01:43:53,660 --> 01:44:00,493
No, it couldn’t be.

1469
01:44:00,493 --> 01:44:07,326
But you look like...

1470
01:44:07,326 --> 01:44:14,159
Look like who?

1471
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:20,992
Like Erina Pendleton?

1472
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:27,825
It’s been a while, Jonathan Joestar.

1473
01:44:27,825 --> 01:44:34,658
How?

1474
01:44:34,658 --> 01:44:41,491
This is my father’s hospital.

1475
01:44:41,491 --> 01:44:48,324
We moved to India seven years
ago, and just recently returned.

1476
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:55,157
It’s really been too long.

1477
01:44:55,157 --> 01:45:01,990
<i>I was weak back then,
I couldn’t run to your side</i>

1478
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:08,823
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

1479
01:45:08,823 --> 01:45:15,656
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

1480
01:45:15,656 --> 01:45:22,489
<i>My feelings are still the same</i>

1481
01:45:22,489 --> 01:45:29,322
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

1482
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:36,155
<i>Erina</i>

1483
01:45:36,155 --> 01:45:42,988
<i>JoJo</i>

1484
01:45:42,988 --> 01:45:49,821
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

1485
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:56,654
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

1486
01:45:56,654 --> 01:46:03,487
Erina!

1487
01:46:03,487 --> 01:46:10,320
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

1488
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:17,153
My goodness, you caught
me with your broken arm!

1489
01:46:17,153 --> 01:46:23,986
I’ll always be there to catch you.

1490
01:46:23,986 --> 01:46:30,819
<i>When our</i>

1491
01:46:30,819 --> 01:46:37,652
<i>Eyes meet</i>

1492
01:46:37,652 --> 01:46:44,485
<i>I can see it there</i>

1493
01:46:44,485 --> 01:46:51,318
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

1494
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:58,151
<i>Your hand</i>

1495
01:46:58,151 --> 01:47:05,000
<i>Meets mine</i>

1496
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
<i>I can feel you there</i>

1497
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,971
<i>Our fates entwined forever</i>

1498
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:13,942
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

1499
01:47:13,942 --> 01:47:15,913
<i>Drawn together on that fleeting day</i>

1500
01:47:15,913 --> 01:47:17,884
<i>We’ll continue from there</i>

1501
01:47:17,884 --> 01:47:19,855
<i>Just the two of us</i>

1502
01:47:19,855 --> 01:47:21,826
Fate? That’s right.

1503
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:23,797
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

1504
01:47:23,797 --> 01:47:25,768
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

1505
01:47:25,768 --> 01:47:27,739
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1506
01:47:27,739 --> 01:47:29,710
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

1507
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:31,681
<i>It was the same method, another woman—</i>

1508
01:47:31,681 --> 01:47:33,652
<i>Her throat was slit</i>

1509
01:47:33,652 --> 01:47:35,623
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

1510
01:47:35,623 --> 01:47:37,594
<i>The utmost cruelty!</i>

1511
01:47:37,594 --> 01:47:39,565
<i>No known motive at all!</i>

1512
01:47:39,565 --> 01:47:41,536
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

1513
01:47:41,536 --> 01:47:43,507
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

1514
01:47:43,507 --> 01:47:45,478
<i>(Don’t go out walking at night!)</i>

1515
01:47:45,478 --> 01:47:47,449
<i>(You’ll be killed! He’ll find you!)</i>

1516
01:47:47,449 --> 01:47:49,420
<i>(The plague of London,
that bloodthirsty killer!)</i>

1517
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:51,391
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

1518
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:53,362
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

1519
01:47:53,362 --> 01:47:55,333
<i>Jack the Ripper!</i>

1520
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:57,304
You’re kidding!

1521
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,275
Oh, it’s already so late!

1522
01:47:59,275 --> 01:48:01,246
I have to return home soon...

1523
01:48:01,246 --> 01:48:03,217
It’s not late at all!

1524
01:48:03,217 --> 01:48:05,188
But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!

1525
01:48:05,188 --> 01:48:07,159
It’s a terrifying thought!

1526
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:09,130
Terrifying, is it?

1527
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,101
It is!

1528
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:13,072
Well, as a matter of fact...

1529
01:48:13,072 --> 01:48:15,043
You’re talking with him right now!

1530
01:48:15,043 --> 01:48:17,014
You’re out playing too late,

1531
01:48:17,014 --> 01:48:19,000
You dirty harlot!

1532
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Who goes there?

1533
01:48:22,000 --> 01:49:51,000
You...

1534
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I like you.

1535
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,148
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

1536
01:49:55,148 --> 01:49:55,296
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

1537
01:49:55,296 --> 01:49:55,444
<i>I’ve been reborn, now’s the
time for my life to start!</i>

1538
01:49:55,444 --> 01:49:55,592
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

1539
01:49:55,592 --> 01:49:55,740
<i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>

1540
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:55,888
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

1541
01:49:55,888 --> 01:49:56,036
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1542
01:49:56,036 --> 01:49:56,184
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

1543
01:49:56,184 --> 01:49:56,332
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1544
01:49:56,332 --> 01:49:56,480
Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

1545
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:56,628
They fear that which is spectacularly evil.

1546
01:49:56,628 --> 01:49:56,776
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

1547
01:49:56,776 --> 01:49:56,924
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

1548
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:57,072
How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?

1549
01:49:57,072 --> 01:49:57,220
What do you know about me?!

1550
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:57,368
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

1551
01:49:57,368 --> 01:49:57,516
<i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>

1552
01:49:57,516 --> 01:49:57,664
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

1553
01:49:57,664 --> 01:49:57,812
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

1554
01:49:57,812 --> 01:49:57,960
Me, afraid?!

1555
01:49:57,960 --> 01:49:58,108
{\an8}<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>
{\ O (spread): I couldn't face you}

1556
01:49:58,108 --> 01:49:58,256
That’s right!

1557
01:49:58,256 --> 01:49:58,404
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1558
01:49:58,404 --> 01:49:58,552
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

1559
01:49:58,552 --> 01:49:58,700
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

1560
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:58,848
<i>I’m not scared of anything!</i>

1561
01:49:58,848 --> 01:49:59,000
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

1562
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
<i>You—</i>

1563
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,818
<i>Come to my side, Jack the Ripper!</i>

1564
01:50:03,818 --> 01:50:07,636
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1565
01:50:07,636 --> 01:50:11,454
<i>Who are you?</i>

1566
01:50:11,454 --> 01:50:15,272
<i>Seeing stars, or seeing mud?</i>

1567
01:50:15,272 --> 01:50:19,090
<i>We’ll change the tune of
that tired old philosophy!</i>

1568
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:22,908
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

1569
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:26,726
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

1570
01:50:26,726 --> 01:50:30,544
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1571
01:50:30,544 --> 01:50:34,362
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

{\ O (spread): Touch and there}

1575
01:50:45,816 --> 01:50:49,634
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1576
01:50:49,634 --> 01:50:53,452
The Stone Mask...

1577
01:50:53,452 --> 01:50:57,270
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

1578
01:50:57,270 --> 01:51:01,088
Yes.

1579
01:51:01,088 --> 01:51:04,906
It has to have been.

1580
01:51:04,906 --> 01:51:08,724
It’s alright.

1581
01:51:08,724 --> 01:51:12,542
I’m alright.

1582
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:16,360
Let’s go.

1583
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:20,178
Eh?

1584
01:51:20,178 --> 01:51:24,000
What’s wrong?

1585
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Who’s that?

1586
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,619
Has he been here
this whole time?

1587
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:30,238
Jonathan Joestar!

1588
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:32,857
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

1589
01:51:32,857 --> 01:51:35,476
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

1590
01:51:35,476 --> 01:51:38,095
The Stone Mask?!

1591
01:51:38,095 --> 01:51:40,714
JoJo!

1592
01:51:40,714 --> 01:51:43,333
<i>(Pow!)</i>

1593
01:51:43,333 --> 01:51:45,952
<i>Squeeze out</i>

1594
01:51:45,952 --> 01:51:48,571
<i>Every last ounce</i>

1595
01:51:48,571 --> 01:51:51,190
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

1596
01:51:51,190 --> 01:51:53,809
How could you, he’s injured!

1597
01:51:53,809 --> 01:51:56,428
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

1598
01:51:56,428 --> 01:51:59,047
<i>I am Baron Zeppeli!</i>
{\ O (spread): Like you}

1599
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:01,666
<i>Courage alone won’t defeat
the power of the Stone Mask</i>

1600
01:52:01,666 --> 01:52:04,285
<i>I am on your side!</i>
{\ O (spread): Like you}

1601
01:52:04,285 --> 01:52:06,904
<i>I manipulated your breath, your
breath made the pain go away</i>

1602
01:52:06,904 --> 01:52:09,523
<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

1603
01:52:09,523 --> 01:52:12,142
Who are you?

1604
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:14,761
What did you do to me?!

1605
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,380
How do you know my name!

1606
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:20,000
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

1607
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

1608
01:52:25,000 --> 01:53:12,666
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

1609
01:53:12,666 --> 01:54:00,332
<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>

1610
01:54:00,332 --> 01:54:48,000
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>
{\ O (spread): Who is it?}

1611
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
What will happen now?

1612
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,022
<i>Let me demonstrate for you</i>

1613
01:54:49,022 --> 01:54:49,044
<i>The power that this breathing awakens!</i>

1614
01:54:49,044 --> 01:54:49,066
<i>(Breathe in, breathe out)</i>

1615
01:54:49,066 --> 01:54:49,088
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1616
01:54:49,088 --> 01:54:49,110
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1619
01:54:49,154 --> 01:54:49,176
<i>With this special breathing</i>

1620
01:54:49,176 --> 01:54:49,198
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1621
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:49,220
<i>You carry special oxygen</i>
{\ O (spread): Me, you, how about you come with me, Dio?}

1622
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:49,242
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1623
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:49,264
<i>In the blood it sends racing</i>

1624
01:54:49,264 --> 01:54:49,286
<i>All throughout your body!</i>

1625
01:54:49,286 --> 01:54:49,308
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1626
01:54:49,308 --> 01:54:49,330
<i>And energy is born!</i>

1627
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:49,352
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1628
01:54:49,352 --> 01:54:49,374
<i>Its name is—</i>

1629

{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1630
01:54:49,396 --> 01:54:49,418
<i>Ripple Energy!</i>

1631
01:54:49,418 --> 01:54:49,440
<i>(Memetaa!)</i>

1632
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:49,462
{\an8}[TN: Sound of a frog being punched]

1633
01:54:49,462 --> 01:54:49,484
<i>The ripple’s power
passes through the frog</i>

1634
01:54:49,484 --> 01:54:49,506
<i>Making this miracle happen—</i>

1635
01:54:49,506 --> 01:54:49,528
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

1636
01:54:49,528 --> 01:54:49,550
<i>The power this breathing
infuses into your blood!</i>

1637
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:49,572
<i>(In, out)</i>

1638
01:54:49,572 --> 01:54:49,594
<i>(In, out)</i>

1639
01:54:49,594 --> 01:54:49,616
Breathing?

1640
01:54:49,616 --> 01:54:49,638
Everyone has a little bit of energy
flowing through their bloodstream.

1641
01:54:49,638 --> 01:54:49,660
It does things like carry nutrients
and regulate your body temperature.

1642
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:49,682
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.

1643
01:54:49,682 --> 01:54:49,704
This is made possible by the rhythm
of a particular breathing technique.
{\ O (spread): what happened?}

1644
01:54:49,704 --> 01:54:49,726
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!
{\ O (spread): Who is it?}

1645
01:54:49,726 --> 01:54:49,748
Yes! The power of breathing!

1646
01:54:49,748 --> 01:54:49,770
In, out!

1647
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:49,792
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

1648
01:54:49,792 --> 01:54:49,814
<i>They’re two sides of the same coin,
this breathing and the Stone Mask</i>

1649
01:54:49,814 --> 01:54:49,836
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

1650
01:54:49,836 --> 01:54:49,858
Dio!

1651
01:54:49,858 --> 01:54:49,880
Yes!

1652
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:49,902
<i>The mask is not broken—he has it!</i>

1653
01:54:49,902 --> 01:54:49,924
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

1654
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:49,946
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

1655
01:54:49,946 --> 01:54:49,968
<i>Pursuing the mask</i>

1656
01:54:49,968 --> 01:54:50,000
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

1657
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Dio is alive?!

1658
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,081
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1659
01:54:55,081 --> 01:54:59,162
<i>We must fight!</i>

1660
01:54:59,162 --> 01:55:03,243
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1661
01:55:03,243 --> 01:55:07,324
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

1662
01:55:07,324 --> 01:55:11,405
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1663
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:15,486
<i>And you must wield this
ripple energy, or you will die! </i>

1664
01:55:15,486 --> 01:55:19,567
<i>That’s right, your fate,
and the fate of the world</i>

1665
01:55:19,567 --> 01:55:23,648
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1666
01:55:23,648 --> 01:55:27,729
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

1667
01:55:27,729 --> 01:55:31,810
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1668
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:35,891
<i>I finally found it!</i>

1669
01:55:35,891 --> 01:55:39,972
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

1670
01:55:39,972 --> 01:55:44,053
<i>Are all tied together. This is—</i>

1671
01:55:44,053 --> 01:55:48,134
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1672
01:55:48,134 --> 01:55:52,215
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1673
01:55:52,215 --> 01:55:56,296
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1674
01:55:56,296 --> 01:56:00,377
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1675
01:56:00,377 --> 01:56:04,458
<i>Destiny!</i>

1676
01:56:04,458 --> 01:56:08,539
To fight... That is my destiny!

1677
01:56:08,539 --> 01:56:12,620
Mine and Dio’s!

1678
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:16,701
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

1679
01:56:16,701 --> 01:56:20,782
That turns humans into vampires.

1680
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:24,863
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

1681
01:56:24,863 --> 01:56:28,944
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

1682
01:56:28,944 --> 01:56:33,025
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

1683
01:56:33,025 --> 01:56:37,106
Ah, let’s put it this way.

1684
01:56:37,106 --> 01:56:41,187
What must you do to stop that ripple?

1685
01:56:41,187 --> 01:56:45,268
I think I’ve got it!

1686
01:56:45,268 --> 01:56:49,349
Use a ripple!

1687
01:56:49,349 --> 01:56:53,440
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

1688
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,440
And that wave of energy

1689
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,143
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

1690
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:58,846
You see?

1691
01:56:58,846 --> 01:57:00,549
The power to defeat Dio!

1692
01:57:00,549 --> 01:57:02,252
We’re already out of time.

1693
01:57:02,252 --> 01:57:03,955
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

1694
01:57:03,955 --> 01:57:05,658
JoJo?

1695
01:57:05,658 --> 01:57:07,361
What do you mean, Dio?

1696
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:09,064
Erina...

1697
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:10,767
I can’t get you involved in this!
{\ O (spread): Hamon Energy}

1698
01:57:10,767 --> 01:57:12,470
For now, please just go along with it!

1699
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:14,173
I swear I’ll come back here again.

1700
01:57:14,173 --> 01:57:15,880
How...?
{\ O (spread): This is the power of Hamon}

1701
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,640
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

1702
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:27,525
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>

1703
01:57:27,525 --> 01:57:35,410
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>

1704
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:43,295
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

1706
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:59,065
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

01:57:59,065 --> 01:58:06,950
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1708
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:14,835
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>

1709
01:58:14,835 --> 01:58:22,720
<i>I am left behind</i>

1710
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:30,605
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

1711
01:58:30,605 --> 01:58:38,490
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

1712
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:46,375
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

1713
01:58:46,375 --> 01:58:54,260
<i>I want to scream!</i>

1714
01:58:54,260 --> 01:59:02,145
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

1715
01:59:02,145 --> 01:59:10,030
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

1716
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:17,915
<i>Forever guided by fate</i>

1717
01:59:17,915 --> 01:59:25,800
<i>I’ll live my days, spinning its thread</i>

1718
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:33,685
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>

1719
01:59:33,685 --> 01:59:41,570
<i>Waiting right here</i>

1720
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:49,455
<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>

1721
01:59:49,455 --> 01:59:57,340
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>

1722
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:05,225
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>

1723
02:00:05,225 --> 02:00:13,110
<i>So that I can call this
destiny one of love</i>

1724
02:00:13,110 --> 02:00:21,000
<i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>

1725

02:02:00,927 --> 02:02:05,854
<i>No matter where you are, I will, I will,</i>

1730
02:02:05,854 --> 02:02:10,781
<i>I will live on!</i>

1731
02:02:10,781 --> 02:02:15,708
<i>I will live on!</i>

1732
02:02:15,708 --> 02:02:20,635
<i>I will live on!</i>

1733
02:02:20,635 --> 02:02:25,562
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

1734
02:02:25,562 --> 02:02:30,489
Yep!

1735
02:02:30,489 --> 02:02:35,416
C’mere!

1736
02:02:35,416 --> 02:02:40,343
Why are you so strong?!

1737
02:02:40,343 --> 02:02:45,270
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!

1738
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:50,197
Speeeedwagon!

1739
02:02:50,197 --> 02:02:55,124
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

1740
02:02:55,124 --> 02:03:00,051
JOJO: Stop right there!

1741
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:04,978
Mr. Joestar!

1742
02:03:04,978 --> 02:03:09,905
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

1743
02:03:09,905 --> 02:03:14,832
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

1744
02:03:14,832 --> 02:03:19,759
Licky licky? Licky licky!

1745
02:03:19,759 --> 02:03:24,686
Licky licky! Licky licky!

1746
02:03:24,686 --> 02:03:29,613
Lickithan Joestar.

1747
02:03:29,613 --> 02:03:34,540
JoJo, be careful.

1748
02:03:34,540 --> 02:03:39,467
He’s strong enough to rival you.

1749
02:03:39,467 --> 02:03:44,394
What was that, you old fart?

1750
02:03:44,394 --> 02:03:49,321
<i>Old fart?</i>

1751
02:03:49,321 --> 02:03:54,248
Time for a taste!

1752
02:03:54,248 --> 02:03:59,175
His arm... got longer!

1753
02:03:59,175 --> 02:04:04,102
It’s useless.

1754
02:04:04,102 --> 02:04:09,029
I’ve been given new life!

1755
02:04:09,029 --> 02:04:13,956
And a body that transcends humanit—

1756
02:04:13,956 --> 02:04:18,883
That’s not what’s important here.

1757
02:04:18,883 --> 02:04:23,810
M-My body...

1758
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:28,737
It’s hot!

1759
02:04:28,737 --> 02:04:33,664
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!

1760
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:38,591
Ah! Wait!

1761
02:04:38,591 --> 02:04:43,518
It’s amazing!

1762
02:04:43,518 --> 02:04:48,445
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.
{\ O (spread): Jojo, Dio.}

1763
02:04:48,445 --> 02:04:53,372
What’s wrong, JoJo?

1764
02:04:53,372 --> 02:04:58,299
I lost so much...

1765
02:04:58,299 --> 02:05:03,226
That’s why I wanted power.

1766
02:05:03,226 --> 02:05:08,153
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

1767
02:05:08,153 --> 02:05:13,100
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!

1768
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,500
But it’s the same power!

1769
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,277
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:

1770
02:05:16,277 --> 02:05:18,054
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”

1771
02:05:18,054 --> 02:05:19,831
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

1772
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:21,608
They became vikings with backbone!

1773
02:05:21,608 --> 02:05:23,385
You are different from Dio and his ilk!
{\ O (spread): The stars are attracted to each other}

1774
02:05:23,385 --> 02:05:25,162
Because you feel the pain.
{\ O (spread): Guided by the destiny I love}

1775
02:05:25,162 --> 02:05:26,939
Pain...

1776
02:05:26,939 --> 02:05:28,716
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>

1777
02:05:28,716 --> 02:05:30,493
<i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>

1778
02:05:30,493 --> 02:05:32,270
<i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>

1779
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:34,047
<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

1780
02:05:34,047 --> 02:05:35,824
You need to listen to that pain!

1781
02:05:35,824 --> 02:05:37,601
<i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>

1782
02:05:37,601 --> 02:05:39,378
<i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>

1783
02:05:39,378 --> 02:05:41,155
<i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>

1784
02:05:41,155 --> 02:05:42,932
<i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>

1785
02:05:42,932 --> 02:05:44,709
<i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>

1786
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:46,486
<i>Staining the darkness red</i>

1787
02:05:46,486 --> 02:05:48,263
<i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>

1788
02:05:48,263 --> 02:05:50,040
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1789
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:51,817
It was pure coincidence!

1790
02:05:51,817 --> 02:05:53,600
I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

1791
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
What was that?!

1792
02:05:55,600 --> 02:06:00,188
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>

1793
02:06:00,188 --> 02:06:04,776
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>

1794
02:06:04,776 --> 02:06:09,364
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>

1795
02:06:09,364 --> 02:06:13,952
<i>The mask burst with light</i>

1796
02:06:13,952 --> 02:06:18,540
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>

1797
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:23,128
Mr. Zeppeli!

1798
02:06:23,128 --> 02:06:27,716
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>

1799
02:06:27,716 --> 02:06:32,304
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>

1800
02:06:32,304 --> 02:06:36,892
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>

1801
02:06:36,892 --> 02:06:41,480
It was my father!

1802
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:46,068
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>

1803
02:06:46,068 --> 02:06:50,656
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>

1804
02:06:50,656 --> 02:06:55,244
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1805
02:06:55,244 --> 02:06:59,832
<i>ZEP: I’ve been chasing after it
JOJO: So that it won’t repeat</i>

1806
02:06:59,832 --> 02:07:04,420
<i>ZEP: I swore to take revenge
JOJO: I won’t let you down!</i>

1807
02:07:04,420 --> 02:07:09,008
<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be
JOJO: Shining bright</i>

1808
02:07:09,008 --> 02:07:13,596
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>

1809
02:07:13,596 --> 02:07:18,184
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!

1810
02:07:18,184 --> 02:07:22,780
And the resolve to face the consequences.

1811
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,420
JoJo!

1812
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:27,157
Hey JoJo.

1813
02:07:27,157 --> 02:07:30,894
JoJo JoJo JoJo.

1814
02:07:30,894 --> 02:07:34,631
Ha-hey JoJo.

1815
02:07:34,631 --> 02:07:38,368
Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.

1816
02:07:38,368 --> 02:07:42,105
Don’t forget this goal.

1817
02:07:42,105 --> 02:07:45,842
Yes, sir.

1818
02:07:45,842 --> 02:07:49,579
I believe in the power of the ripple.

1819
02:07:49,579 --> 02:07:53,316
Yep.

1820
02:07:53,316 --> 02:07:57,053
I like your fringe.
{\ O (spread): What is that power?}

1821
02:07:57,053 --> 02:08:00,790

1822
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:04,527
Hey JoJo, JoJo!

1823
02:08:04,527 --> 02:08:08,264
Why, why?!

1824
02:08:08,264 --> 02:08:12,001
Jonathan Joestar!

1825
02:08:12,001 --> 02:08:15,738
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

1826
02:08:15,738 --> 02:08:19,475
Are you angry?

1827
02:08:19,475 --> 02:08:23,212
You’re good company, huh?

1828
02:08:23,212 --> 02:08:26,949
Oh! It burns! It burns!

1829
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:30,686
My body, it—

1830
02:08:30,686 --> 02:08:34,423
Is that Mr. Horse?

1831
02:08:34,423 --> 02:08:38,160
Look Wang Chan!
Your, your ancestors—

1832
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:41,897
Clippity clop, clippity clop!

1833
02:08:41,897 --> 02:08:45,634
There he is.

1834
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:49,371
<i>The lovable sweetheart, Mr. Joestar,
has finally got a handle on the ripple</i>

02:08:53,108 --> 02:08:56,845
<i>These bills been piling piling up</i>

02:08:56,845 --> 02:09:00,582
<i>Your underworld rep, AKA
Speedwagon, is here to give a full report</i>

1838
02:09:00,582 --> 02:09:04,319
<i>Who else would be your guide</i>

1839
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,056
<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>

1840
02:09:08,056 --> 02:09:11,793
<i>South of London, in total daylight,</i>

1841
02:09:11,793 --> 02:09:15,530
<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

1842
02:09:15,530 --> 02:09:19,267
<i>When we pass through this
tunnel, you’ll see the sights</i>

1843
02:09:19,267 --> 02:09:23,004
<i>That famous city of knights</i>

1844
02:09:23,004 --> 02:09:26,741
<i>This is Windknight’s Lot</i>

1845
02:09:26,741 --> 02:09:30,478
<i>A natural fortress like an augite rock</i>

1846
02:09:30,478 --> 02:09:34,215
<i>Windknight’s Lot</i>

1847
02:09:34,215 --> 02:09:37,952
<i>Fate’ll have it—Dio’s hideout</i>

1848
02:09:37,952 --> 02:09:41,689
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1849
02:09:41,689 --> 02:09:45,426
<i>We’ll knock it out</i>

1850
02:09:45,426 --> 02:09:49,163
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1851
02:09:49,163 --> 02:09:52,900
<i>Clean this vampire nest out</i>

1852
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:56,637
<i>Ay, Dio, dick, you make me sick</i>

1853
02:09:56,637 --> 02:10:00,374
<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>

1854
02:10:00,374 --> 02:10:04,111
<i>No more tomorrows Dio, that’s it</i>

1855
02:10:04,111 --> 02:10:07,848
<i>Now’s the end, ya gonna get hit!</i>

1856
02:10:07,848 --> 02:10:11,585
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.

1857
02:10:11,585 --> 02:10:15,322
My underground sources say that
Wang Chan definitely fled here.

1858
02:10:15,322 --> 02:10:19,059
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

1859
02:10:19,059 --> 02:10:22,796
It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.

1860
02:10:22,796 --> 02:10:26,533
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

1861
02:10:26,533 --> 02:10:30,270
Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.

1862
02:10:30,270 --> 02:10:34,007
Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?

1863
02:10:34,007 --> 02:10:37,744
Whaaat?!

1864
02:10:37,744 --> 02:10:41,481
Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.

1865
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:45,218
L-Look!

1866
02:10:45,218 --> 02:10:49,000
T-The horse!!

1867
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
What is he...
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

1868
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:21,000
He’s inside the horse’s body!

1869
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!

1870
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Mr. Joestar!

1871
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,631
Stand down, you two.

1872
02:11:55,631 --> 02:11:58,262
I will fight!

1873
02:11:58,262 --> 02:12:00,893
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!

1874
02:12:00,893 --> 02:12:03,524
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

1875
02:12:03,524 --> 02:12:06,155
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

1876
02:12:06,155 --> 02:12:08,786
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

1877
02:12:08,786 --> 02:12:11,417
What are you yammering on about!

1878
02:12:11,417 --> 02:12:14,048
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

1879
02:12:14,048 --> 02:12:16,679
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

1880
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:19,310
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

1881
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:21,941
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!

1882
02:12:21,941 --> 02:12:24,572
The hymn of humanity
is a song of courage!

1883
02:12:24,572 --> 02:12:27,203
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

1884
02:12:27,203 --> 02:12:29,834
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

1885
02:12:29,834 --> 02:12:32,465
They’re just like fleas!

1886
02:12:32,465 --> 02:12:35,096
Hot, so hot!

1887
02:12:35,096 --> 02:12:37,727
How dare you! I’ll kill you!

1888
02:12:37,727 --> 02:12:40,358
Yes... I’ll eat every
shred of you in one bite!

1889
02:12:40,358 --> 02:12:43,000
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!

1890
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Windknight’s Lot...

1891
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,339
I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.

1892
02:12:51,339 --> 02:12:55,678
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

1893
02:12:55,678 --> 02:13:00,017
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

1894
02:13:00,017 --> 02:13:04,356
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

1895
02:13:04,356 --> 02:13:08,695
Can you hear me?

1896
02:13:08,695 --> 02:13:13,034
Sleeping knights...

1897
02:13:13,034 --> 02:13:17,373
<i>Follow me, serve royalty once again</i>

1898
02:13:17,373 --> 02:13:21,712
<i>Get your revenge on the past,
let’s rewrite history</i>

1899

But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,

<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2067
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:49,415
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2068
02:25:49,415 --> 02:25:50,700
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2069
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:51,985
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2070
02:25:51,985 --> 02:25:53,270
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2071
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:54,555
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2072
02:25:54,555 --> 02:25:55,840
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2073
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,125
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!

2074
02:25:57,125 --> 02:25:58,410
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2075
02:25:58,410 --> 02:25:59,695
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2076
02:25:59,695 --> 02:26:00,980
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2077
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,265
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2078
02:26:02,265 --> 02:26:03,550
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2079
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:04,835
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2080
02:26:04,835 --> 02:26:06,120
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2081
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:07,405
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>

2082
02:26:07,405 --> 02:26:08,690
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2083
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:09,975
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2084
02:26:09,975 --> 02:26:11,260
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2085
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,545
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2086
02:26:12,545 --> 02:26:13,830
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2087
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:15,115
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2088
02:26:15,115 --> 02:26:16,400
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!

2089
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:17,685
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2090
02:26:17,685 --> 02:26:18,970
But those two should
have done a better job!

2091
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,255
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2092
02:26:20,255 --> 02:26:21,540
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2093
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:22,825
It might be as you say, however—

2094
02:26:22,825 --> 02:26:24,110
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2095
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:25,395
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2096
02:26:25,395 --> 02:26:26,680
Everything is connected!

2097
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:27,965
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2098
02:26:27,965 --> 02:26:29,250
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2099
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:30,535
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2100
02:26:30,535 --> 02:26:31,820
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2101
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:33,105
<i>Either one—</i>

2102
02:26:33,105 --> 02:26:34,390
<i>JoJo</i>

2103
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:35,675
<i>Dio</i>

2104
02:26:35,675 --> 02:26:37,000
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2105
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I turned those two
{\ O (rank): Don't do it}

2106
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,333
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!

2107
02:26:42,333 --> 02:26:45,666
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (spread): Wave Gate of the Sun}

2108
02:26:45,666 --> 02:26:48,999
It can’t be!

2109
02:26:48,999 --> 02:26:52,332
Such grotesque forms!

2110
02:26:52,332 --> 02:26:55,665
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2111
02:26:55,665 --> 02:26:58,998
Don’t you think so?

2112
02:26:58,998 --> 02:27:02,331
Kill them all!

2113
02:27:02,331 --> 02:27:05,664
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2114
02:27:05,664 --> 02:27:08,997
Tarkus!

2115
02:27:08,997 --> 02:27:12,330
Bruford!

2116
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:15,663
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2117
02:27:15,663 --> 02:27:18,996
Our grudge!

2118
02:27:18,996 --> 02:27:22,329
Our pride!

2119
02:27:22,329 --> 02:27:25,662
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2120
02:27:25,662 --> 02:27:29,000
And you, Tarkus!

2121
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The way you feel—
{\ O (rank): JoeJoe}

2122
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Your pride, your resentment.

2123
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I can’t even imagine it!

2124
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
But I also bear my own burdens!

2125
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2126
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2127
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
That man’s pride...

2128
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2129
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
My master—I, Bruford,

2130
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,947
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2131
02:27:57,947 --> 02:28:01,894
Alright, go ahead!

2132
02:28:01,894 --> 02:28:05,841
We’ll duel as knights!

2133
02:28:05,841 --> 02:28:09,788
Run away, you two!

2134
02:28:09,788 --> 02:28:13,735
Mr. Joestar!

2135
02:28:13,735 --> 02:28:17,682
Tarkus!

2136
02:28:17,682 --> 02:28:21,629
I won’t let you interfere!

2137
02:28:21,629 --> 02:28:25,576
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2138
02:28:25,576 --> 02:28:29,523
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2139
02:28:29,523 --> 02:28:33,470
Old man!

2140
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:37,417
Don’t come any closer!

2141
02:28:37,417 --> 02:28:41,364
Damn it...

2142
02:28:41,364 --> 02:28:45,311
Fucking hell!

2143
02:28:45,311 --> 02:28:49,258
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2144
02:28:49,258 --> 02:28:53,205
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2145
02:28:53,205 --> 02:28:57,152
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2146
02:28:57,152 --> 02:29:01,099
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2147
02:29:01,099 --> 02:29:05,046
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2148
02:29:05,046 --> 02:29:09,000
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2149
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Honourable knight,

2150
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,611
Is revenge your answer?

2151
02:29:15,611 --> 02:29:20,222
Is that what you take pride in?

2152
02:29:20,222 --> 02:29:24,833
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2153
02:29:24,833 --> 02:29:29,444
You can lecture me after you win!

2154
02:29:29,444 --> 02:29:34,055
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2155
02:29:34,055 --> 02:29:38,666
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2156
02:29:38,666 --> 02:29:43,277
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2157
02:29:43,277 --> 02:29:47,888
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

2158
02:29:47,888 --> 02:29:52,499
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2159
02:29:52,499 --> 02:29:57,110
Old man!

2160
02:29:57,110 --> 02:30:01,721
Melt!

2161
02:30:01,721 --> 02:30:06,332
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2162
02:30:06,332 --> 02:30:10,943
Speedwagon...

2163
02:30:10,943 --> 02:30:15,554
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2164
02:30:15,554 --> 02:30:20,165
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2165
02:30:20,165 --> 02:30:24,776
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2166
02:30:24,776 --> 02:30:29,387
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>
{\ O (spread): It's the story of a proud knight.}

2167
02:30:29,387 --> 02:30:33,998
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2168
02:30:33,998 --> 02:30:38,609
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2169
02:30:38,609 --> 02:30:43,220
JoJo!

2170
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:47,831
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2171
02:30:47,831 --> 02:30:52,442
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2172
02:30:52,442 --> 02:30:57,060
Let it somehow be restored!

2173
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2174
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:03,691
This pain means nothing to me!

2175
02:31:03,691 --> 02:31:08,322
Why aren’t you moving?

2176
02:31:08,322 --> 02:31:12,953
Just now,

2177
02:31:12,953 --> 02:31:17,584
You said “pain”.

2178
02:31:17,584 --> 02:31:22,215
That means that now,

2179
02:31:22,215 --> 02:31:26,846
You can feel pain!

2180
02:31:26,846 --> 02:31:31,477
Pain?

2181
02:31:31,477 --> 02:31:36,108
That’s why...

2182
02:31:36,108 --> 02:31:40,739
I stopped fighting you.

2183
02:31:40,739 --> 02:31:45,370
That’s why you stopped your sword.

2184
02:31:45,370 --> 02:31:50,001
You are a great knight.

2185
02:31:50,001 --> 02:31:54,632
You are human!

2186
02:31:54,632 --> 02:31:59,263
Pain...

2187
02:31:59,263 --> 02:32:03,894
Is proof of life!

2188
02:32:03,894 --> 02:32:08,525
So this is what it means to be human?
{\ O (spread): I trained that strength}

2189
02:32:08,525 --> 02:32:13,156
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

2190
02:32:13,156 --> 02:32:17,787
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

2191
02:32:17,787 --> 02:32:22,418
Bruford...

2192
02:32:22,418 --> 02:32:27,060
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

2193
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Luck!

2194
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:29,060
And also...

2195
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
Pluck!

2196
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:35,060
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

2197
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:39,060
Damn you!

2198
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:43,060
JoJo!

2199
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:47,060
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

2200
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:51,060
Just as I thought...

2201
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:55,060
I, Dio, will—

2202
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:59,060
Hey baby!

2203
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:03,060
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!
{\ O (spread): There's no way we could refuse}

2204
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
What the...

2205
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:15,726
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

2206
02:33:15,726 --> 02:33:26,392
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

2207
02:33:26,392 --> 02:33:37,058
What an embarrassment of a knight!

2208
02:33:37,058 --> 02:33:47,724
He never got his revenge!
{\ O (spread): Your master is not imprisoned.}

2209
02:33:47,724 --> 02:33:58,390
What did he have to be joyful about!

2210
02:33:58,390 --> 02:34:09,060
JoJo!

2211
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
No!

2212
02:34:11,060 --> 02:34:17,417
How could you!

2213
02:34:17,417 --> 02:34:23,774
For victory!

2214
02:34:23,774 --> 02:34:30,131
I take pride in victory!

2215
02:34:30,131 --> 02:34:36,488
Fuck!

2216
02:34:36,488 --> 02:34:42,845
I’ll get you!

2217
02:34:42,845 --> 02:34:49,202
I’ll get you for this!

2218
02:34:49,202 --> 02:34:55,559
JoJo...

2219
02:34:55,559 --> 02:35:01,916
JoJo!

2220
02:35:01,916 --> 02:35:08,273
My final ripple...

2221
02:35:08,273 --> 02:35:14,630
My... dying wish is...

2222
02:35:14,630 --> 02:35:20,987
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

2223
02:35:20,987 --> 02:35:27,344
He collapsed.

2224
02:35:27,344 --> 02:35:33,701
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

2225
02:35:33,701 --> 02:35:40,058
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

2226
02:35:40,058 --> 02:35:46,415
Old man!

2227
02:35:46,415 --> 02:35:52,772
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread): You may be right.}

2228
02:35:52,772 --> 02:35:59,129
If we lose you—

2229
02:35:59,129 --> 02:36:05,486
There’s no time to be sad.

2230
02:36:05,486 --> 02:36:11,843
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

2231
02:36:11,843 --> 02:36:18,200
Old man!

2232
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:24,557
I...

2233
02:36:24,557 --> 02:36:30,914
I lived my own life to the fullest.

2234
02:36:30,914 --> 02:36:37,271
In the end,

2235
02:36:37,271 --> 02:36:43,628
I leave everything I have to you.

2236
02:36:43,628 --> 02:36:50,000
JoJo,

2237
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You are my hope.

2238
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

2239
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:14,500
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

2240
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:21,000
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

2241
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:32,000
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

2242
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

2243
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,000
<i>Into my spirit</i>

2244
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
It felt like...

2245
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.

2246
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:52,352
From here on...

2247
02:40:52,352 --> 02:40:52,704
I live within you.

2248
02:40:52,704 --> 02:40:53,056
JoJo.

2249
02:40:53,056 --> 02:40:53,408
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2250
02:40:53,408 --> 02:40:53,760
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

2251
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,112
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

2252
02:40:54,112 --> 02:40:54,464
<i>Even this pain...</i>

2253
02:40:54,464 --> 02:40:54,816
<i>Even this pain</i>

2254
02:40:54,816 --> 02:40:55,168
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

2255
02:40:55,168 --> 02:40:55,520
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

2256
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:55,872
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

2257
02:40:55,872 --> 02:40:56,224
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

2258
02:40:56,224 --> 02:40:56,576
<i>And from this prison...</i>

2259
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:56,928
<i>I see the stars</i>

2260
02:40:56,928 --> 02:40:57,280
<i>A golden spirit</i>
{\ O (spread): Pride, the great wrestler Bruford}

2261
02:40:57,280 --> 02:40:57,632
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

2262
02:40:57,632 --> 02:40:58,000
<i>Will light up</i>

2263
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
<i>The way to you...</i>

2264
02:41:00,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Dio!

2265
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:43,000
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

2266
02:42:43,000 --> 02:43:00,000
JoJo...!

2267
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:17,000
<i>Dio...</i>

2268
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:34,000
<i>Dio...</i>

2269

<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

2270
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:41,333
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

2271
02:43:41,333 --> 02:43:41,666
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

2273
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:50,000

02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:59,000
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

2276
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:02,607
<i>You and I are different</i>

2277
02:44:02,607 --> 02:44:06,214
<i>We’re not so different, you’re my son</i>

2278
02:44:06,214 --> 02:44:09,821
<i>I have changed into something new</i>

2279
02:44:09,821 --> 02:44:13,428
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

2280
02:44:13,428 --> 02:44:17,035
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

2281
02:44:17,035 --> 02:44:20,642
<i>DIO: I’ll steal it all

2283
02:44:24,249 --> 02:44:27,856
<i>DARIO: You’re my clever boy!</i>

2284
02:44:27,856 --> 02:44:31,463
<i>DIO: I will conquer it all</i>

2285
02:44:31,463 --> 02:44:35,070
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

2286
02:44:35,070 --> 02:44:38,677
<i>DIO: I will dominate everything</i>

2287
02:44:38,677 --> 02:44:42,284
<i>Go ahead and dominate,
what will you want after that?</i>

2288
02:44:42,284 --> 02:44:45,891
<i>What do I want?</i>

2289
02:44:45,891 --> 02:44:49,498
<i>DARIO: What do you want?</i>

2290
02:44:49,498 --> 02:44:53,105
<i>DIO: What do I want?</i>

2291
02:44:53,105 --> 02:44:56,712
<i>I want...</i>
{\ O (spread): Fuck}

2292
02:44:56,712 --> 02:45:00,319
<i>I want...</i>
{\ O (spread): Fuck}

2293
02:45:00,319 --> 02:45:03,926
{\an8}<i>Dio... Dio...</i>

2294
02:45:03,926 --> 02:45:07,533
<i>I want...</i>

2295
02:45:07,533 --> 02:45:11,140
So you’ve come...

2296
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:14,747
JoJo.

2297
02:45:14,747 --> 02:45:18,354
Is this...

2298
02:45:18,354 --> 02:45:21,961
The world you wished for?

2299
02:45:21,961 --> 02:45:25,568
What?

2300
02:45:25,568 --> 02:45:29,175
The world...

2301
02:45:29,175 --> 02:45:32,782
That you’ve been trying
to obtain for so long...

2302
02:45:32,782 --> 02:45:36,389
Surrounded by death...

2303
02:45:36,389 --> 02:45:40,000
It’s a pitiful world, isn’t it?

2304
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
It’s a splendid world where
I’ve dominated everything.

2305
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

2306
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
For that reason, you stole
from uninvolved innocents?

2307
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:03,000
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

2308
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:07,400
You’re just afraid.

2309
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:11,800
Of being human...
{\ O (spread): What if}

2310
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:16,200
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

2311
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,600
For the sake of obtaining this world...

2312
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:25,000
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

2313
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
You ran away from it.

2314
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:31,700
The ends justify the means.

2315
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:36,400
I will win,

2316
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:41,100
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

2317
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:45,800
All of this is fate!

2318
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:50,500
No!

2319
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:55,200
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

2320
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,900
Opposing fate...

2321
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:04,600
What will your legacy be?

2322
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:09,300
Such righteousness!

2323
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:14,000
Just like the one who gave me this power...

2324
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And then died!

2325
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Just like...

2326
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Your father.

2327
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
That’s right.

2328
02:47:47,000 --> 02:48:01,000
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

2329
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

2330
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
For the sake of revenge...

2331
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Dio...

2332
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I will kill you!

2333
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,666
We’re one and the same; you want
to exact your revenge! I admire that!

2334
02:48:13,666 --> 02:48:16,332
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!
{\ O (spread): now}

2335
02:48:16,332 --> 02:48:19,000
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

2336
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Speedwagon!

2337
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:21,173
Right!

2338
02:48:21,173 --> 02:48:21,346
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

2339
02:48:21,346 --> 02:48:21,519
<i>I’ll suck you dry</i>

2340
02:48:21,519 --> 02:48:21,692
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

2341
02:48:21,692 --> 02:48:21,865
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

2342
02:48:21,865 --> 02:48:22,038
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

2343
02:48:22,038 --> 02:48:22,211
<i>Useless, useless, useless, useless!</i>

2344
02:48:22,211 --> 02:48:22,384
<i>I obtained this power</i>

2345
02:48:22,384 --> 02:48:22,557
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

2346
02:48:22,557 --> 02:48:22,730
<i>So I could steal everything from you</i>

2347
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:22,903
<i>I’ll dull this pain</i>

2348
02:48:22,903 --> 02:48:23,076
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

2349
02:48:23,076 --> 02:48:23,249
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

2350
02:48:23,249 --> 02:48:23,422
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

2351
02:48:23,422 --> 02:48:23,595
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

2352
02:48:23,595 --> 02:48:23,768
<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

2353
02:48:23,768 --> 02:48:23,941
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

2354
02:48:23,941 --> 02:48:24,114
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

2355
02:48:24,114 --> 02:48:24,287
You did it! You defeated Dio!

2356
02:48:24,287 --> 02:48:24,460
Not a chance!

2357
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:24,633
You fools!

2358
02:48:24,633 --> 02:48:24,806
What! The sword is freezing—

2359
02:48:24,806 --> 02:48:25,000
Utterly pathetic!

2360
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Mr. Joestar!

2361
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:50,250
JoJo!

2362
02:48:50,250 --> 02:49:13,500
<i>Utterly pathetic! I’m grasping
your carotid artery, JoJo!</i>

2363
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:36,750
<i>With this, you’ll become
one of my undead servants</i>

2364
02:49:36,750 --> 02:50:00,000
<i>Ironic, isn’t it, Dio?</i>

2365
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:07,000
<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

2366
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:13,000
<i>Why don’t you freeze me now, Dio!</i>

2367
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,142
My fist... Just from hitting him!

2368
02:50:13,142 --> 02:50:13,284
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

2369
02:50:13,284 --> 02:50:13,426
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

2370
02:50:13,426 --> 02:50:13,568
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): You are this Dio}

2371
02:50:13,568 --> 02:50:13,710
<i>DIO: Let’s test your willpower
JOJO: I will reach you!</i>

2372
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:13,852
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

2373
02:50:13,852 --> 02:50:13,994
<i>JOJO: Us humans...
DIO: To be human is to have limits</i>

2374
02:50:13,994 --> 02:50:14,136
<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

2375
02:50:14,136 --> 02:50:14,278
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2376
02:50:14,278 --> 02:50:14,420
<i>DIO: I’ll chip away at this body to prove it
JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

2377
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:14,562
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

2378
02:50:14,562 --> 02:50:14,704
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2379
02:50:14,704 --> 02:50:14,846
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

2380
02:50:14,846 --> 02:50:14,988
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2381

<i>JOJO: Our connection, it’s here
DIO: Even when I’ve thrown away my humanity</i>

2382
02:50:15,130 --> 02:50:15,272
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2383
02:50:15,272 --> 02:50:15,414
<i>With my life on the
line, I’ll prove it now!</i>

2384

<i>-Dio! Dio! Dio!
-JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

2386
02:50:15,698 --> 02:50:15,840
“I like being number one!”

2387
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:15,982
“My eye!”

2388
02:50:15,982 --> 02:50:16,124
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

This is impossible!

02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:16,692
The heat is coursing through me!

2393
02:50:16,692 --> 02:50:16,834
I’m melting!

2394
02:50:16,834 --> 02:50:17,000
Crumble to dust!

2395
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I can’t be...

2396
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:34,428
Not yet!!

2397
02:50:34,428 --> 02:50:48,856
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

2398

<i>(In the Windknight’s Lot Paper)</i>

2413
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
<i>An eye-witness reported</i>

2414
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
<i>That the following day, below a cliff</i>

2415
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
<i>Men were seen burning clothing</i>

2416
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
<i>(And destroying something with a hammer)</i>

2417
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:25,000
<i>It seemed to be a stone mask</i>

2418

<i>(Jonathan Joestar, of Liverpool, was wed)</i>

2422
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>(To the Pendletons’
daughter, Erina Pendleton)</i>
{\ O (spread): Life spills out of my arms again}

2423
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>In a small notice, they announced:</i>
{\ O (spread): You taught me my meaning and my destiny}

2424
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>The honeymoon would be a trip
to the United States by steamer</i>
{\ O (spread): He taught me that the greatness of human beings is courage}

2425
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>(Now, on to other news...)</i>
{\ O (spread): The light I receive will permeate my heart}

2426
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Mr. Joestar! Both of you!
{\ O (spread): It was like having a best friend and a son at the same time.}

2427
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Best of wishes!

2428
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I’ll always be there for you!
{\ O (spread): thank you}

2429
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
If you’re in trouble, I’ll rush anywhere!

2430
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Happy honeymoon!

2431
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I can’t wait to hear all about it!

2432
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
America, how nice!

2433
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I wanna go there too,

2434
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And try to dig up some oil for myself!

2435
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Damn it...

2436
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But after this, a fateful
moment was soon to come...

2437
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
This story will be passed down
until the world has come full circle.
{\ O (spread): I'll light up the darkness and come to you}

2438
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That will be the life’s work
of Speedwagon the meddler...
{\ O (spread): My hands to you}

2439
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But, the one to tell you what
happens right now won’t be me...
{\ O (spread): girl}

2440
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>I pray that today will never end</i>
{\ O (spread): Okay, okay.}

2441
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>In the midst of a carousel of stars</i>
{\ O (spread): Can't you hear my voice, my voice calling out to you?}

2442
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>
{\ O (spread): I can't hear it, I've already killed the past}

2443
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
What’s wrong?
{\ O (spread): Don't call me by my name, I'm not like you}

2444
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
When you’re next to me...

2445
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I’m happy!

2446
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I feel the same.

2447
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I wish you could’ve met my father...

2448
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Well, let’s go and eat!

2449
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Jonathan?

2450
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s...

2451
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Erina,

2452
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Go back to our cabin.

2453
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Don’t forget to lock the door!

2454
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I have lured him here.

2455
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
My body...
{\ O (spread): It's a wonderful world where I control everything. Even death and history...}

2456
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Have you come?
{\ O (spread): And to do so, do we rob innocent people?}

2457
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Dio...
{\ O (spread): It's a noble sacrifice for the future I envision.}

2458
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
JoJo...

2459
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

2460
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I used to despise you so much,
{\ O (spread): I just ran away.}

2461
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But now I respect you...

2462
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s because I’ve realised something!

2463
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
If there is a God that controls fate,

2464
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

2465
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
You’re the reason I got this power,

2466
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And you’re the reason why...

2467
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
The world has slipped from my grasp!

2468
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
When will it...
{\ O (spread): He gave me strength and then died.}

2469
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Be enough for you?
{\ O (spread): It's your father!}

2470
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s exactly what our destiny is!
{\ O (spread): That's right...}

2471
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.
{\ O (spread): It's something I can't do in all seriousness, but...}

2472
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And live in eternal glory!
{\ O (spread): The current Jonathan Joos...}

2473
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): To get revenge!}

2474
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
You and I...

2475
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Are one and the same in this world!
{\ O (spread): You're the same too!}

2476
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Lord Dio! Look, look, look!
{\ O (spread): That's how you get rid of your grudge!}

2477
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Please look!
{\ O (spread): No! You've been in denial!}

2478

<i>From light to darkness</i>
{\ O (spread): Speed ​​out!}

2480
02:53:37,888 --> 02:53:38,776
<i>This is the start of my mythos</i>

2481
02:53:38,776 --> 02:53:39,664
<i>I will end it all</i>

2482
02:53:39,664 --> 02:53:40,552
<i>And restart it all</i>
{\ O (spread): Dear Joes!}

2483
02:53:40,552 --> 02:53:41,440
<i>For this is Dio’s World!</i>

2484
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:42,328
Right, Erina Joestar?

2485
02:53:42,328 --> 02:53:43,216
Dio!

2486
02:53:43,216 --> 02:53:44,104
<i>I can’t speak—can’t breathe—</i>

<i>My ripple!</i>

2488
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Erina! Not you too!

2489
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:51,727
<i>This is the start of his mythos!</i>

2490
02:53:51,727 --> 02:53:56,454
<i>This ark is swarming with his followers!</i>

2491
02:53:56,454 --> 02:54:01,181
Please, spare the child!

2492
02:54:01,181 --> 02:54:05,908
Run!

2493
02:54:05,908 --> 02:54:10,635
Shall we torture him to death?!

2494
02:54:10,635 --> 02:54:15,362
Or maybe enjoy watching him asphyxiate?!

2495
02:54:15,362 --> 02:54:20,089
Wang Chan!

2496
02:54:20,089 --> 02:54:24,816

2501
02:54:43,724 --> 02:54:48,451
<i>I’ll tie our futures together</i>

2514
02:55:45,175 --> 02:55:49,902
<i>There’s a meaning to it all!</i>
{\ O (spread): Why aren't you freezing me right now? Diou!}

<i>(The tale will keep on being told)</i>

2574
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,800
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

2575
03:01:23,800 --> 03:03:45,800
<i>(Our golden spirit will shine)</i>

2576
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

2577
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:52,492
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.

2578
03:03:52,492 --> 03:03:58,184
This is a public [streamed] performance.

2579
03:03:58,184 --> 03:04:03,876
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread): Heir to the John Star family}

2580
03:04:03,876 --> 03:04:09,568
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread): Jongran}

2581
03:04:09,568 --> 03:04:15,260
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.

2582
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:20,952
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.

2583
03:04:20,952 --> 03:04:26,644
Thank you for today.

2584
03:04:26,644 --> 03:04:32,336
The musical will close tomorrow, though.

2585
03:04:32,336 --> 03:04:38,028
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread): Erina Pendleton}

2586
03:04:38,028 --> 03:04:43,720
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.

2587
03:04:43,720 --> 03:04:49,412
There have been many
things that led to this day.

2588
03:04:49,412 --> 03:04:55,104
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...

2589
03:04:55,104 --> 03:05:00,796
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...

2590
03:05:00,796 --> 03:05:06,488
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.

2591
03:05:06,488 --> 03:05:12,180
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

2592
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:17,872
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—

2593
03:05:17,872 --> 03:05:23,564
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.

2594
03:05:23,564 --> 03:05:29,256
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.

2595
03:05:29,256 --> 03:05:34,948
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.

2596
03:05:34,948 --> 03:05:40,640
From the bottom of my heart,

2597
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:46,332
Pow.

2598
03:05:46,332 --> 03:05:52,024
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!

2599
03:05:52,024 --> 03:05:57,716
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.

2600
03:05:57,716 --> 03:06:03,408
Thank you for today!

2601
03:06:03,408 --> 03:06:09,100
Did you have fun, everyone?!

2602
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:14,792
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.

2603
03:06:14,792 --> 03:06:20,484
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.

2604
03:06:20,484 --> 03:06:26,176
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.

2605
03:06:26,176 --> 03:06:31,868
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.

2606
03:06:31,868 --> 03:06:37,560
I—are you worried?

2607
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:43,252
Nah, it’s probably okay.

2608
03:06:43,252 --> 03:06:48,944
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!

2609
03:06:48,944 --> 03:06:54,636
-He’s—that’s in the past.

2610
03:06:54,636 --> 03:07:00,328
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.

2611
03:07:00,328 --> 03:07:06,020
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.

2612
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:11,712
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,

2613
03:07:11,712 --> 03:07:17,404
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.

2614
03:07:17,404 --> 03:07:23,096
And I’m relieved that we made it.

2615
03:07:23,096 --> 03:07:28,788
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!

2616
03:07:28,788 --> 03:07:34,480
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

2617
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:40,172
But when we made it to opening day,

2618
03:07:40,172 --> 03:07:45,864
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,

2619
03:07:45,864 --> 03:07:51,556
Which has continued up through today.

2620
03:07:51,556 --> 03:07:57,248
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.

2621
03:07:57,248 --> 03:08:02,940
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.

2622
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:08,632
For having supported us up to this point.

2623
03:08:08,632 --> 03:08:14,324
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.

2624
03:08:14,324 --> 03:08:20,016
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

2625
03:08:20,016 --> 03:08:25,708
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.

2626
03:08:25,708 --> 03:08:31,400
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.

2627
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:37,092
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!

2628
03:08:37,092 --> 03:08:42,784
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.

2629
03:08:42,784 --> 03:08:48,476
Excuse yourself...

2630
03:08:48,476 --> 03:08:54,168
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.

2631
03:08:54,168 --> 03:08:59,860
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.

2632
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:05,552
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.

2633
03:09:05,552 --> 03:09:11,244
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.

2634
03:09:11,244 --> 03:09:16,936
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.

2635
03:09:16,936 --> 03:09:22,628
You were just that wonderful.

2636
03:09:22,628 --> 03:09:28,320
[INAUDIBLE]

2637
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:34,012
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...

2638
03:09:34,012 --> 03:09:39,704
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—

2639
03:09:39,704 --> 03:09:45,396
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.

2640
03:09:45,396 --> 03:09:51,088
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.

2641
03:09:51,088 --> 03:09:56,780
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

2642
03:09:56,780 --> 03:10:02,472
Thank you everyone in the cast!

2643
03:10:02,472 --> 03:10:08,164
It was wonderful. Thanks!

2644
03:10:08,164 --> 03:10:13,856
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

2645
03:10:13,856 --> 03:10:19,548
Now to everyone at the theatre,

2646
03:10:19,548 --> 03:10:25,240
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

2647
03:10:25,240 --> 03:10:31,000
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
{\ O (spread): JoJo!}

2648
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thanks!

2649
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:41,473
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.

2650
03:10:41,473 --> 03:10:49,946
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!

2651
03:10:49,946 --> 03:10:58,419
Everyone, do your best!

2652
03:10:58,419 --> 03:11:06,892
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!

2653
03:11:06,892 --> 03:11:15,365
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?

2654
03:11:15,365 --> 03:11:23,838
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!

2655
03:11:23,838 --> 03:11:32,311
I’m gonna watch it too!

2656
03:11:32,311 --> 03:11:40,784
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

2657
03:11:40,784 --> 03:11:49,257
Pardon me.

2658
03:11:49,257 --> 03:11:57,730
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!

2659
03:11:57,730 --> 03:12:06,203
Truly, thank you for today!

2660
03:12:06,203 --> 03:12:14,676
{\an8}[TN: Everyone’s muted for about 2 min]

2661
03:12:14,676 --> 03:12:23,149
[INAUDIBLE]

2662
03:12:23,149 --> 03:12:31,622
MAMORU: It’s already over.

2663
03:12:31,622 --> 03:12:40,095
[INAUDIBLE]

2664
03:12:40,095 --> 03:12:48,568
Thank you! Thank you!

2665
03:12:48,568 --> 03:12:57,041
Definitely, please support
tomorrow’s performance too!

2666
03:12:57,041 --> 03:13:05,514
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

2667
03:13:05,514 --> 03:13:14,000
MAMORU: Do your best!

2668
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Thank you!
