{\an8}WARNING

4
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,218
Is this thing on?

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,410
Can you hear me?

6
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:13,678
Okay, it’s good.

7
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:16,184
Everything’s working.

8
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,705
You, watching this.

9
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:23,986
Yeah, you there.

10
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,321
You have been chosen.

11
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:31,394
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

12
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:39,149
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

13
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,031
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.

14
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:50,890
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.

15
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:54,614
It keeps moving forward.

16
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,763
That is why I have to
create this record now.

17
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:05,239
If something should
happen to me, I—

18
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:10,935
Never mind.

19
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,062
Back to the story.

20
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:22,098
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

21
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,512
Such as medicine, pharmacy, and archaeology—

22
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:33,945
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

23
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,779
That’s how it looks on the outside.

24
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,553
Right, that’s the cover.

25
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,159
Now, listen carefully.

26
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:49,394
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

27
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:57,892
And created our branches around the world...

28
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,325
That secret is...

29
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:05,001
The Stone Mask.

30
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:31,749
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

31
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,474
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

32
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:46,032
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

33
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:55,383
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

34
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,211
It all began in the 13th century.

35
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:04,372
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

36
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:09,268
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

37
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:19,407
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

38
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:21,472
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

39
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:26,281
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

40
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:28,104
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

41
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:31,945
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>

42
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,669
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

43
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,585
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>

44
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:35,582
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

45
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,151
{\an8}<i>(Eternal!)</i>

46
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,910
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,758
<i>Taken in this hand</i>

48
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,761
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

49
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:45,786
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

50
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:44,594
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

51
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:46,377
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

52
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,539
<i>Blood of the living</i>

53
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:48,074
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

54
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,307
<i>Life is power</i>

55
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:49,795
{\an8}<i>(We sacrifice!)</i>

56
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:52,227
<i>The power in this hand</i>

57
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,066
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

58
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,573
<i>(We are children of the sun!)</i>

59
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,995
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

60
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:10,377
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

61
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:18,578
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

62
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:22,743
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

63
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:27,264
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

64
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:31,935
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

65
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:40,855
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

66
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,404
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

67
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:53,601
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

68
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,516
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

69
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:03,252
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

70
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,031
Wot have we here!

71
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:09,625
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

72
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,936
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

73
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,009
-Hang on...

74
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:17,005
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

75
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,525
-Wait!

76
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,913
I said wait!

77
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,401
Yahoo!

78
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:25,276
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

79
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,526
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

80
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:31,343
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

81
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,058
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

82
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:40,460
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

83
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:43,611
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

84
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,745
What the—

85
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,173
Just a creepy mask!

86
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,618
Don’t need that!

87
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,374
Darling!

88
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:51,808
What?!

89
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,719
In the carriage! A baby survived!

90
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:57,315
A baby?! Leave it there!

91
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,427
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

92
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,220
Oh...

93
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,633
Well, isn’t this a nice ring? I’ll take that!

94
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,096
-What are you doing?

95
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:08,581
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

96
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,084
Have a look!

97
00:07:10,886 --> 00:07:12,654
A pocket watch too!

98
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,464
Nice teeth!

99
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:20,162
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

100
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,562
That’s enough!

101
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,160
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

102
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,766
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

103
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,924
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.

104
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,727
You... Did you rescue us...?

105
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,586
Are my wife and son...?

106
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,601
She croa—

107
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,932
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

108
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,388
Go get him!

109
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,549
So this too is fate...

110
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:02,901
I want to express my gratitude
to you for saving my life...

111
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,231
My name is Joestar...

112
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:09,649
I will never forget your kindness!

113
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:13,612
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

114
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,605
Dario Brando!

115
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:35,365
And so the years flow by until 1880.

116
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:39,335
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

117
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:46,671
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

118
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,730
{\an8}They were caught up in a dream!

119
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:55,298
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

120
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,451
{\an8}Their hands were reaching out!

121
00:08:56,273 --> 00:09:04,437
<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride
in our queen, we pierce the horizon)</i>

122
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:03,997
{\an8}<i>(We pierce!)</i>

123
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:06,379
{\an8}The times have changed them!

124
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:07,087
<i>(In midnight blue darkness)</i>

125
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:13,024
<i>(We grovel and squirm to
get our hands on what we want)</i>

126
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,427
{\an8}<i>(We squirm!)</i>

127
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,688
{\an8}I hear those voices,

128
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,950
{\an8}Those oh-so-familiar voices!

129
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:34,743
<i>Well, your faces seem to be asking
“Who’s this?” so listen up!</i>

130
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,715
<i>Let me introduce myself:</i>

131
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:38,467
<i>Speedwagon’s in da house!</i>

132
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:42,389
<i>While I’m passing down this
story to the future generations,</i>

133
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:46,193
<i>Since it’ll all be yours, I might
as well tell you all what’s sweet</i>

134
00:09:46,238 --> 00:09:50,115
<i>Let me tell you what’s going
on in this era and this land</i>

135
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:54,248
<i>Let</i> Speedwagon <i>tell you
all about this era and this land!</i>

136
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:58,767
<i>(The world is speeding up)</i>

137
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,781
{\an8}<i>(Speeding up)</i>

138
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:02,432
<i>(So don’t let yourself be thrown off!)</i>

139
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:06,537
<i>(The lamplight of the Industrial
Revolution burns bright)</i>

140
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:10,162
<i>(So we sleep with hope in our hearts)</i>

141
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,251
{\an8}Between the light and darkness!

142
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:14,973
<i>(Should strife and inequality judge you)</i>

143
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:21,780
<i>(Reach out your hand to
the sunlight yellow beam)</i>

144
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,305
{\an8}And reach for the heavens!

145
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:26,593
<i>(Set your soul aflame in
the beat of the steam)</i>

146
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,477
{\an8}The light!

147
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,900
<i>(The midnight blue darkness is growing)</i>

148
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,424
<i>(Throw away your fears,
and cut ties with your weaknesses)</i>

149
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,639
{\an8}The dark!

150
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,929
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

151
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,977
<i>Light and dark, illumination and shadow
Front and back, two diverging paths</i>

152
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:44,154
<i>Challenge your God, seize your fortune
It’s a new era, steam trains are the craze</i>

153
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,742
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

154
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:48,218
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

155
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,488
<i>The factory of the world, Great Britain</i>

156
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,472
<i>The spark of desire ignites to no end</i>

157
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,483
<i>The social order got a great reset</i>

158
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:51,524
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

159
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,280
<i>Don’t let this era
slip from your hands</i>

160
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:56,607
<i>(Sunlight yellow gleam,
the hymn of humanity)</i>

161
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,831
{\an8}Sunlight yellow!

162
00:10:56,655 --> 00:11:00,252
<i>(With voices ringing to the heavens)</i>

163
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,427
{\an8}The hymn of humanity!

164
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:01,011
{\an8}To the heavens!

165
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:02,944
<i>(Midnight blue darkness)</i>

166
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:03,356
{\an8}Midnight blue!

167
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:08,833
<i>(We rip through the wasteland,
carrying our resolve)</i>

168
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:06,210
{\an8}Rip through the wasteland!

169
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,364
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

170
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,516
<i>Newborn babes crying out
in the midst of disparity</i>

171
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:13,490
<i>A lineage of destiny, Phantom Blood</i>

172
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,726
<i>Fate’s thread is woven without any end</i>

173
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,260
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

174
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:19,880
<i>And just as with any adventure of men,
Always gorgeous but bizarre now and then</i>

175
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:22,140
{\an8}<i>(The light!)</i>

176
00:11:19,986 --> 00:11:22,524
<i>See with your own eyes the whole venture</i>

177
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,852
<i>That’s right, this is
one Bizarre Adventure!</i>

178
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,361
{\an8}<i>(The dark!)</i>

179
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:42,603
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

180
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:44,667
Oi!

181
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:45,705
Stupid brat!

182
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:47,067
Stop!

183
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,447
Shit—

184
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:51,733
Oi, brat! Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?

185
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,344
C’mon, let’s go!

186
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:57,895
Nice!

187
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:59,656
Hey, look at ‘im. Bastard!

188
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,580
Don’t let this brat go!

189
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,195
Little puke stain!

190
00:12:07,614 --> 00:12:10,812
What’re you looking at, smart-arse?

191
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:12,651
Oi!

192
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:16,187
How’s your old man doing, shitstain?

193
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,021
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

194
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,391
He croak or somethin’?

195
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:26,978
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

196
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,706
Shame, she was a real looker!

197
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:34,521
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

198
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,630
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

199
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,387
What is it, Father?

200
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:42,697
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

201
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,883
Nah, I don’t need that.

202
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:46,753
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

203
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:51,948
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

204
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,890
I’m worried that after I die...

205
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:57,753
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

206
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,114
Oi!

207
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,261
Dio!

208
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,788
Take this.

209
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,230
“Joestar”?

210
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,593
He’s a noble.

211
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,623
And he owes me one.

212
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:19,065
When I die, send him that letter.

213
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,715
Go to him.

214
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,878
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

215
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

216
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:30,095
Father...

217
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,387
<i>Now</i> you start acting like a parent?!

218
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,476
Dio!

219
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:36,266
Listen up...

220
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,765
You’re a smart boy.

221
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,525
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

222
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:03,369
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

223
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:09,652
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

224
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:15,596
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

225
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:21,398
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

226
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:27,817
<i>And yet, my mum told me to be noble</i>

227
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:34,227
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

228
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:40,032
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

229
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:46,441
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

230
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:48,502
Just like that...

231
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,119
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

232
00:14:55,969 --> 00:15:01,028
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

233
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:07,474
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

234
00:15:08,537 --> 00:15:12,819
<i>Is it blue?</i>

235
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,504
<i>Tell me, Joestar</i>

236
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:32,619
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

237
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,157
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

238
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:44,493
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

239
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:50,850
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

240
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:56,887
<i>Now, I’ll go take this “inheritance”</i>

241
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,489
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

242
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:11,977
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

243
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:18,021
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

244
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:24,433
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

245
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:32,286
<i>Is the sun shining?</i>

246
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:38,050
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

247
00:16:57,191 --> 00:16:58,512
Oh yeah!

248
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,509
You’ve got something good today too, eh?

249
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:02,732
Give it back!

250
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:04,548
Over here!

251
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:11,198
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

252
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:13,019
My father’s a real doctor!

253
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:17,557
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

254
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,433
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!

255
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,190
Stop right there!

256
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,913
What are you doing?! Take this!

257
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:35,888
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

258
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,313
Ow! That hurt!

259
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,946
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?

260
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,374
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

261
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:45,252
I’m gonna give him even
more of a walloping!

262
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,473
Ah-ha!

263
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,837
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

264
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,476
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

265
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:04,671
Danny!

266
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,284
Eh?!

267
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:09,421
Let’s go already! Shit!

268
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,642
Uh... Are you alright?

269
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:15,729
Leave me alone!

270
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:16,222
But...

271
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,220
I did this because I wanted to.

272
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,269
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.

273
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,542
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

274
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:29,230
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

275
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:34,518
I’ll beat them, someday.

276
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:38,292
Let’s go, Danny!

277
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,430
Oh, wait!

278
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:48,833
Jonathan Joestar...

279
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:24,513
You...

280
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,718
You must be Dio Brando!

281
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,926
And you’re...

282
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:31,473
Jonathan Joestar?

283
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,807
Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!

284
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:36,122
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

285
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:38,657
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!

286
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,115
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

287
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:42,158
Friend?

288
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,198
Yeah!

289
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,168
Danny! What was that for!

290
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,186
Danny!

291
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:51,273
You won’t get away with this!

292
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,969
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

293
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,067
Lord Joestar!

294
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,026
Come inside!

295
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:03,971
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

296
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,825
Something wrong, JoJo?

297
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:08,277
Ah, nothing.

298
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:12,079
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

299
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:15,653
Starting today, you are part of our family.

300
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,785
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

301
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,478
Yes!

302
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,292
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.

303
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:25,706
Mister Brando!

304
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,750
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

305
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:30,399
Police? Has something happened?

306
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,276
Oh, no!

307
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:34,393
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

308
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:38,489
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

309
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:39,500
Ah, that was—

310
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:41,373
-He came at me so suddenly.

311
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,185
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

312
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:49,069
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

313
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:55,001
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

314
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,755
JoJo!

315
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,979
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

316
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:02,179
Yes, sir.

317
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:03,026
Good.

318
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:08,954
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

319
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:11,132
Make sure to get along with each other.

320
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:14,566
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

321
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:15,915
Mister Brando!

322
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:20,443
Nice to have met you!

323
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:24,966
Ta-ta, JoJo!

324
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:34,604
Now then, let me get—

325
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:35,993
Watch it!

326
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:38,360
Don’t touch my bag!

327
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,502
I was just trying to carry it for—

328
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,546
That’s enough.

329
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:44,577
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

330
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:47,505
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

331
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:53,222
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

332
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:56,102
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!

333
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,232
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

334
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:01,481
I was only trying to be friendly!

335
00:22:01,705 --> 00:22:04,380
What are you two doing?

336
00:22:06,983 --> 00:22:08,491
And one more thing—

337
00:22:10,734 --> 00:22:12,822
I hate dogs.

338
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,995
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

339
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,872
Keep your stupid dog away from me!

340
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,135
Coming, Lord Joestar!

341
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:36,712
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

342
00:22:56,979 --> 00:23:00,224
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?

343
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:08,145
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

344
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:16,146
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

345
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:21,056
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

346
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:19,754
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>

347
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,761
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>

348
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:24,145
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

349
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,129
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>

350
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:27,199
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

351
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,990
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

352
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,459
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

353
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:36,754
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

354
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:40,773
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

355
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:44,052
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

356
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,408
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

357
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,329
It’s just because I love reading so much!

358
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,857
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

359
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:11,097
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

360
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:18,749
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

361
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:23,914
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

362
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,755
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>

363
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,530
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

364
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:27,771
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

365
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,731
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>

366
00:24:27,876 --> 00:24:29,874
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

367
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:34,556
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

368
00:24:33,946 --> 00:24:36,462
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

369
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:39,031
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

370
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,519
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

371
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,541
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

372
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:51,689
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

373
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:56,236
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>

374
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:59,236
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

375
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:08,908
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

376
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But...

377
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,734
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

378
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:24,936
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

379
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:34,257
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

380
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:39,975
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

381
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:44,882
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

382
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:50,645
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

383
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,236
And so she gave them this condition:

384
00:25:53,590 --> 00:26:00,730
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

385
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:04,469
Here is my question for you:

386
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:05,739
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

387
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:13,155
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

388
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:17,847
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

389
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:21,445
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

390
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:27,440
Or was it the stars shining above them?

391
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:30,022
What do you think?

392
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,263
The stars?

393
00:26:33,331 --> 00:26:34,431
Or the mud?

394
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:37,598
I...

395
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,354
I think they were looking at the mud.

396
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,754
What’s your reasoning?

397
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:52,046
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

398
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,070
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

399
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:58,728
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,

400
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:00,869
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

401
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:01,925
I think...

402
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:05,057
They were looking at the stars!

403
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,426
They held onto their honour!

404
00:27:07,452 --> 00:27:09,973
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

405
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,202
So what!

406
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:13,312
So what?

407
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:20,069
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

408
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,398
But they—

409
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:25,677
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

410
00:27:25,997 --> 00:27:27,297
Such regret...

411
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,650
Such powerlessness...

412
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:32,292
What they saw was the mud!

413
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:36,590
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

414
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,488
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

415
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:41,490
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!

416
00:27:41,514 --> 00:27:42,614
Listen!

417
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,116
You’re a noble! You have it all!

418
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,947
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

419
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:53,560
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

420
00:27:53,661 --> 00:27:54,296
I—

421
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,711
That’s enough, you two.

422
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:01,624
There’s no right answer to this question.

423
00:28:02,408 --> 00:28:03,541
Bear in mind—

424
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:08,761
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

425
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:12,995
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

426
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:17,827
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

427
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:23,317
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

428
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,343
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>

429
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,704
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>

430
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,639
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>

431
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:02,240
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>

432
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:04,584
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>

433
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:06,368
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

434
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:08,391
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

435
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:10,159
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>

436
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,926
<i>The opening bell rings</i>

437
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:14,610
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>

438
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:17,047
Oi!

439
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:19,625
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!

440
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:36,386
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!

441
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,169
Our new champion!

442
00:29:38,188 --> 00:29:39,537
You did it, JoJo!

443
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:41,196
Danny would be proud!

444
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:45,698
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?

445
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,357
Is there anyone?

446
00:29:47,387 --> 00:29:49,331
Everyone listen up!

447
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:54,372
A new face has just asked to join our game.

448
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:57,670
His name is Dio Brando!

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,737
Dio Brando?

450
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:03,542
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?

451
00:30:03,739 --> 00:30:05,095
Yeah! Do it!

452
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:07,540
Alright, let’s do it!

453
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,580
-Good!

454
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:10,177
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—

455
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,707
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.

456
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:15,517
That’s the bell!

457
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,530
-Go, JoJo!

458
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,077
Beat him up!

459
00:30:17,796 --> 00:30:19,227
What is this move!

460
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:20,683
I’ve never seen it before!

461
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:21,961
Oi, JoJo!

462
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:40,248
That’s a hit to the face!

463
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,271
He lost!

464
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,845
Our king! Our king!

465
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,375
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!

466
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:50,154
My eye!

467
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:51,921
Guys, guys, guys!

468
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:58,241
I think my finger went in his eye.

469
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,691
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!

470
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,926
-Hey, hey!

471
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:07,198
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

472
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,403
Teach me!

473
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,768
Guys! Ow...

474
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,265
Danny...

475
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:27,006
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

476
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,746
It feels like he’s invading my life.

477
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:40,987
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>

478
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:46,767
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>

479
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:55,726
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>

480
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:01,568
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

481
00:32:02,772 --> 00:32:07,505
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

482
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:14,129
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

483
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:21,513
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

484
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:27,957
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

485
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:36,551
You’re...

486
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,049
My hanky...

487
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:54,962
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!

488
00:32:54,991 --> 00:32:57,603
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

489
00:32:57,654 --> 00:32:59,553
So stop by again!

490
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:00,450
Danny!

491
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:16,604
Has it caught your fancy?

492
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:20,911
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.

493
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,315
It’s alright.

494
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:28,473
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.

495
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:29,951
Mexico...

496
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:30,939
Mm-hmm.

497
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:37,527
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.

498
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:41,896
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

499
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,880
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

500
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,611
Are you interested in it?

501
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,778
Oh, no. Not especially.

502
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,098
Uh...

503
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,729
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

504
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:08,081
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

505
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:10,694
Friendship? With a dog?

506
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:16,593
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

507
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:22,526
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

508
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:25,374
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

509
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:31,843
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

510
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,294
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.

511
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,919
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

512
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:46,089
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

513
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,131
It was Danny!

514
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:52,469
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

515
00:34:54,526 --> 00:35:00,129
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

516
00:35:01,514 --> 00:35:09,224
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

517
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,873
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

518
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,682
Is that so?

519
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:17,462
M’lord.

520
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,954
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

521
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:27,966
Friends...

522
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:32,432
Erina!

523
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:33,237
JoJo!

524
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,269
The two met once more!

525
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:40,463
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

526
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:44,317
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

527
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,119
Danny!

528
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:48,764
Come boy!

529
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:57,204
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

530
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:01,492
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

531
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,626
Huh? It’s nothing.

532
00:36:04,652 --> 00:36:05,859
What are you hiding?

533
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:07,461
It’s nothing interesting.

534
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,314
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

535
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:10,514
You’ll just laugh!

536
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:11,966
I won’t laugh.

537
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:12,945
You’ll tell people!

538
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,171
I won’t tell, so show me!

539
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,304
I told you, no!

540
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:16,504
JoJo!

541
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:20,102
Oh, my!

542
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:28,004
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>

543
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:36,450
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

544
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,359
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>

545
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,188
Oh!

546
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:44,301
<i>To be laughing like this</i>

547
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:52,445
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

548
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,459
<i>Erina</i>

549
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,394
<i>JoJo</i>

550
00:36:57,139 --> 00:37:00,468
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

551
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:08,038
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

552
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,671
<i>JoJo</i>

553
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:12,830
<i>Erina</i>

554
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:16,705
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

555
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:23,657
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

556
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:33,215
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

557
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:38,270
<i>That would be so
embarrassing, you—</i>

558
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,769
<i>Scoundrel!</i>

559
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:48,748
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>

560
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:57,389
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

561
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,477
<i>Your hand,</i>

562
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:01,536
<i>My hand,</i>

563
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:04,973
<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>

564
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:12,844
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

565
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:21,716
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

566
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:31,835
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>

567
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:37,185
It’s already this late!

568
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:40,788
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

569
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:42,649
Erina!

570
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:43,838
I’ll see you tomorrow!

571
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:45,635
Yes, JoJo!

572
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:46,502
Danny!

573
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:58,070
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>

574
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:06,073
<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>

575
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:14,247
Hey!

576
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:18,121
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

577
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:24,280
I heard you were hanging
out with JoJo today.

578
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,078
Umm...

579
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:27,472
What do you...

580
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:57,928
He...

581
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,490
He did it!

582
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,144
That’s our Dio!

583
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:04,505
He does the things we’re too chicken
to, and with such confidence too!

584
00:40:04,547 --> 00:40:08,398
I’ve got goosebumps!
I want to be just like him!

585
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:14,220
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

586
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:18,107
You haven’t, have you?

587
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:23,858
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...

588
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:25,497
It was me, Dio!

589
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:31,319
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

590
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:35,064
Hey!

591
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,704
She’s—!

592
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,569
You bitch!

593
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:42,015
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

594
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:55,629
<i>Dio...</i>

595
00:40:56,631 --> 00:41:00,747
<i>Dio...</i>

596
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:02,949
Get up, bitch!

597
00:41:02,975 --> 00:41:05,705
What’re you sleeping for?

598
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:09,445
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!

599
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:13,817
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

600
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,048
Hey, now go buy some booze!

601
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:18,942
Father, mother’s clearly not well!

602
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,954
She’s just fakin’ it!

603
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,263
Oi, you hear me?

604
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,611
-Stop it, Father!

605
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,281
Mum! Mum!

606
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,524
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

607
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,189
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

608
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:36,595
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!

609
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:39,887
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

610
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,412
Please, you’ve got to get well!

611
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:49,082
<i>Dio...</i>

612
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:53,815
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

613
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,455
-Mum! Mum!

614
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,247
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

615
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:01,113
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!

616
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,788
But our money’s already—

617
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:05,067
Are you talking back?!

618
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,096
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?

619
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,250
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!

620
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:12,335
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?

621
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:12,945
Father!

622
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:16,705
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!

623
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:21,837
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!

624
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:24,977
After all the trouble I went
through to nick that noble’s shit!

625
00:42:25,287 --> 00:42:27,908
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.

626
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:30,146
Why don’t I send him a letter...

627
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,651
No...

628
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:35,527
You and I are different!

629
00:42:38,196 --> 00:42:41,378
<i>Dio...</i>

630
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:46,338
<i>Dio...</i>

631
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,997
<i>Dio...</i>

632
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,148
Dio!!

633
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:53,937
<i>Dio...</i>

634
00:42:55,974 --> 00:43:01,982
<i>Dio, how could you do such a thing?
How could you hurt her like that!</i>

635
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:08,164
<i>What in the world have I ever done
to you?! Can you tell me, Dio?</i>

636
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,848
<i>You’re so amazing, so
much more than I am</i>

637
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,233
I admired you!

638
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:21,275
<i>But now there is a single
flame that burns in my heart</i>

639
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,590
Dio!

640
00:43:27,966 --> 00:43:30,978
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

641
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,050
<i>DIO: A little too lightly?
JOJO: I’ll never forgive you!</i>

642
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:37,243
<i>So you’ve heard? What I
did to your beloved Erina?</i>

643
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:37,257
-You’ve disgraced her!

644
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:40,818
DIO: I bet you’re mad with jealousy!
<i>JOJO: This is for her sake, not mine!</i>

645
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:52,379
<i>I have to stand up to him, even
if I can’t beat him. I cannot lose!</i>

646
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:59,201
<i>Control your emotions, you’re
different from that drunken lout</i>

647
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:05,408
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

648
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:12,026
<i>I’ll put you back in your place,
I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget</i>

649
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:15,391
Come at me!

650
00:44:15,877 --> 00:44:18,849
<i>This new power arising within me</i>

651
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:20,580
It feels so good!

652
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:32,153
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

653
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,042
Dio!

654
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:43,605
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

655
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:51,041
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

656
00:44:51,076 --> 00:44:53,833
<i>You miserable insect!</i>

657
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,942
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

658
00:44:57,381 --> 00:45:03,697
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

659
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:08,873
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

660
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:14,408
What on earth is going on?!

661
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:19,070
You two! You’ll be punished for this!
Now go back to your rooms!

662
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:33,001
Dio...

663
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,801
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

664
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,594
Ah... Eri—

665
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:49,663
I feel so miserable!

666
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:54,210
I’ve never felt pain like this before...

667
00:45:54,245 --> 00:45:55,245
Erina!

668
00:45:56,347 --> 00:46:01,628
Erina! Did you say goodbye
to all your friends?

669
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,390
Yes, Father.

670
00:46:06,021 --> 00:46:10,045
I’m sorry for imposing my career
on you. Even though I know you—

671
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:11,074
Let’s go.

672
00:46:12,127 --> 00:46:13,974
I’ll make friends over there too.

673
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:20,642
Erina...

674
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:23,823
I underestimated JoJo.

675
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,637
His explosive power...

676
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:30,577
His resilience...

677
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,679
I have to become stronger...

678
00:46:35,122 --> 00:46:37,257
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

679
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,770
I have to control my anger and stay calm...

680
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,337
So that I can take everything from him!

681
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:06,524
However...

682
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:17,069
What’s that noise?

683
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:22,150
Could someone be
inside the incinerator?

684
00:47:23,336 --> 00:47:24,919
Are they trying to get out?!

685
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:26,411
Ah, it burns!

686
00:47:31,094 --> 00:47:32,094
Danny!!

687
00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:33,535
Oh my god...

688
00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:35,848
Someone! Someone please help!

689
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:16,003
<i>Seven years passed from that day</i>

690
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,649
<i>Times are changing,
the Victorian era’s flying by us</i>

691
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,900
<i>Population increasing to
the point of overflowing</i>

692
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:23,181
<i>Art and entertainment
are showered in praise</i>

693
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:26,063
<i>In the middle of this
unstoppable flow, agitation rages</i>

694
00:48:26,095 --> 00:48:28,595
<i>The height of development,
the growth of British culture</i>

695
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:30,811
<i>But what goes up, must come
down. It’s only natural</i>

696
00:48:30,836 --> 00:48:32,727
<i>That the top runners are being singled out</i>

697
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:34,757
<i>London’s peace has one
of its fingers broken</i>

698
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,739
<i>Chaotic days mix the old and the new</i>

699
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:38,739
<i>The map of London
paints a stark contrast</i>

700
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:40,930
<i>Just like the current state of the country</i>

701
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,674
<i>Put the focus on the
dark parts and you’ll see</i>

702
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:44,887
<i>The curtain of swaying inequality</i>

703
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,917
<i>In this market still
learning from its past!</i>

704
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:51,250
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

705
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:52,569
The one excavated from Mexico?

706
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:54,173
From Mexico, you say?

707
00:48:54,216 --> 00:48:55,931
It was quite a while ago...

708
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:58,686
A while?! Could you please clarify?

709
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:01,562
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

710
00:49:01,596 --> 00:49:04,889
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

711
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,803
And bought it from me at a high price—

712
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,638
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

713
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:11,415
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

714
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:12,434
Wait a minute!

715
00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:14,134
I don’t trust you...

716
00:49:14,444 --> 00:49:16,741
Who the hell are you anyway?

717
00:49:16,835 --> 00:49:21,890
I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

718
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:24,436
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

719
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:25,604
All the way from Italy?!

720
00:49:25,615 --> 00:49:26,282
Yes.

721
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,416
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

722
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:30,560
I’ll go check in the books!

723
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:31,578
Thank you.

724
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,074
Just a little word of warning...

725
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:38,447
The sun will be setting soon.

726
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,786
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

727
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:48,537
A fog has rolled in...

728
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:53,700
<i>(A palpable shadow stretches over the city)
</i>

729
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:57,171
<i>(And soon it’ll swallow the sun whole)</i>

730
00:49:57,416 --> 00:50:05,224
<i>(Don’t let it get you,
fight as hard as you can!)</i>

731
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:13,145
<i>(Fog and smog cover the city,
hiding the smell of crime)</i>

732
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:19,994
<i>(Stretch out your hands towards the light)</i>

733
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:22,199
<i>(We won’t sink down to hell!)</i>

734
00:50:25,627 --> 00:50:33,272
<i>The filth rubs off on the clean
and gathers like grime</i>

735
00:50:33,524 --> 00:50:37,350
<i>Thrown away with the rubbish</i>

736
00:50:37,394 --> 00:50:41,050
<i>Pressed together, our
lot gives off a stench</i>

737
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:44,784
<i>The sweet smell of darkness</i>

738
00:50:44,826 --> 00:50:48,435
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

739
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:56,587
<i>(Something’s wrong, people
 are thirsty, distorted, broken!)</i>

740
00:50:56,674 --> 00:51:04,015
<i>(Jack the Ripper has drawn first blood!)</i>

741
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:12,100
<i>(Hate the poor, hate the
rich, and raise your voice)</i>

742
00:51:12,377 --> 00:51:19,002
<i>(Gather here and now, Jacks of this town!)</i>

743
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,416
<i>(Rebellion is now!)</i>

744
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:26,970
<i>In 1887, in Trafalgar Square</i>

745
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:28,487
<i>(We raise our voices!)</i>

746
00:51:28,512 --> 00:51:31,277
<i>(Give us equality! Work! And money!)</i>

747
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:34,375
<i>The rich in their ivory towers</i>

748
00:51:34,398 --> 00:51:36,314
<i>(They look on at us and laugh!)</i>

749
00:51:36,366 --> 00:51:39,465
<i>(Give us food! Every day! Let us live!)</i>

750
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:43,311
<i>(The world is ever accelerating)</i>

751
00:51:43,382 --> 00:51:46,727
<i>Rebellion is stopped in its tracks,
blood floods the streets of London</i>

752
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,365
<i>Away from there now, in Liverpool,
seven years have flown by</i>

753
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:51,654
<i>Their graduation year</i>

754
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,087
<i>Their graduation? But who are “they”?</i>

755
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:56,195
<i>From inside the scrum
they head for victory</i>

756
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:59,970
<i>So dazzling, brightly
shining, a pair of stars</i>

757
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:08,090
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices!)</i>

758
00:52:08,576 --> 00:52:09,829
He’s got it!

759
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:15,750
The star of Hugh Hudson, our very
own Jonathan Joestar, grabs the pass!

760
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:19,169
<i>(He’s like a heavy locomotive!)</i>

761
00:52:18,508 --> 00:52:19,608
{\an8}<i>(One’s on his back!)</i>

762
00:52:19,194 --> 00:52:21,374
<i>(He can’t be toppled)</i>

763
00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:21,526
{\an8}<i>(And a second!)</i>

764
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,515
<i>(Keep pushing forward, JoJo!)</i>

765
00:52:23,102 --> 00:52:24,480
{\an8}<i>(Bloody hell!)</i>

766
00:52:24,554 --> 00:52:26,840
<i>(The pride of our school!)</i>

767
00:52:26,052 --> 00:52:27,052
{\an8}<i>(Incredible!)</i>

768
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,783
<i>(Hugh Hudson’s acclaimed JoJo!)</i>

769
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:28,953
{\an8}<i>(And a fourth!)</i>

770
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,932
<i>(Is he finally wavering?)</i>

771
00:52:30,953 --> 00:52:32,385
{\an8}Someone caught the pass!

772
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:34,418
<i>(None other than the great star Dio)</i>

773
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:35,035
{\an8}<i>(Dio Brando)</i>

774
00:52:34,473 --> 00:52:35,822
<i>(Leaving them all behind)</i>

775
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:38,486
<i>(Once again, Dio catches the pass)</i>

776
00:52:37,934 --> 00:52:39,516
{\an8}<i>(Nobody can catch up to him)</i>

777
00:52:39,474 --> 00:52:42,959
<i>(They move like clockwork! You’d
almost feel bad for their rivals!)</i>

778
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:46,019
<i>(Our school’s pride!)</i>

779
00:52:45,904 --> 00:52:46,700
{\an8}<i>(Truly!)</i>

780
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:50,193
<i>(JoJo and Dio!)</i>

781
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,749
<i>(In perfect harmony, they
make the best partners!)</i>

782
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,596
JoJo! Your pass won’t go to waste!

783
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:00,385
Try!!

784
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:02,977
The final match of the
season ends in victory!

785
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:03,677
Dio!

786
00:53:03,686 --> 00:53:04,282
JoJo!

787
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:05,631
That was magnificent!

788
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,634
It was all thanks to your pass!

789
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:11,184
Let’s go and tell Father
about it right away!

790
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:12,932
Right, JoJo?

791
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,599
Uh-huh.

792
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:14,959
Dio!

793
00:53:15,013 --> 00:53:18,837
Can we write about your friendship
with JoJo for the school newspaper?

794
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:19,865
Thanks!

795
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,719
Let me get changed first.

796
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:23,644
Shall we go home together?

797
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,579
Yeah.

798
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:33,521
<i>Time passed like the
endless flow of water</i>

799
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:40,940
<i>Ever since you started
calling him “Father”</i>

800
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:47,731
<i>I think of that word
which is so familiar to me</i>

801
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,863
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

802
00:53:55,268 --> 00:54:02,002
<i>You’re... beautiful,
and a true gentleman</i>

803
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:08,489
<i>My friend, who’s always
pushing me to be better</i>

804
00:54:09,261 --> 00:54:15,942
<i>You’ve repented for the
wrong you did to Erina</i>

805
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:25,443
<i>You’ve offered me a shoulder
to lean on, now that Danny’s gone</i>

806
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:32,073
<i>We walked this path
together for seven years</i>

807
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:36,325
<i>I always followed in your
footsteps, one step behind,</i>

808
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:48,352
<i>So why is it that I don’t
feel any friendship for you?</i>

809
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:07,544
How are you feeling?

810
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:14,323
Well, I’m old enough now that
a mere cold can last a long time.

811
00:55:14,362 --> 00:55:16,426
Sir, you’re not that old yet!

812
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:22,085
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!

813
00:55:22,124 --> 00:55:24,780
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...

814
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:27,008
Seem to have won!

815
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:35,559
Ah, Dio is a proper member
of the Joestar family now!

816
00:55:37,451 --> 00:55:40,717
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.

817
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:44,328
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

818
00:55:44,831 --> 00:55:49,286
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

819
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,020
I...

820
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:53,451
I admire you! Back then—

821
00:55:53,495 --> 00:55:54,513
My lord!

822
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:55,179
Yes?

823
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:56,508
I’m home!

824
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,606
Dio! Welcome back!
Ah, and JoJo as well!

825
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,067
Father!

826
00:56:03,386 --> 00:56:04,526
Are you alright?

827
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:08,312
I can’t get rid of this cough...

828
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,687
Today, the doctor recommended
I be admitted to hospital.

829
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:16,272
I object!

830
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:22,153
These days, hospitals
only care about profits!

831
00:56:22,602 --> 00:56:24,474
They say it’s a problem in London too.

832
00:56:25,525 --> 00:56:26,525
It’s true...

833
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:29,193
I feel safer at home.

834
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,247
I give in.

835
00:56:32,406 --> 00:56:37,043
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.

836
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:41,415
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!

837
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:41,822
What?!

838
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,322
What?!

839
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:43,385
You already know?

840
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:44,454
How?

841
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,383
Inspector Archer here told me.

842
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:48,990
How rude of you, inspector!

843
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:49,505
Huh?

844
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,512
We...

845
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:55,215
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...

846
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:56,985
So we rushed home!

847
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,653
Oh no, silly me!

848
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,776
I truly am proud.

849
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:10,214
I have such wonderful sons.

850
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,039
Especially you, Dio.

851
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:16,753
You’ve worked so very hard.

852
00:57:17,694 --> 00:57:21,550
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.

853
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:24,583
I was born poor...

854
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:27,063
But you gave me a chance.

855
00:57:27,642 --> 00:57:28,880
Thank you.

856
00:57:30,852 --> 00:57:33,200
Well then, I’ll be off.

857
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:36,563
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

858
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:41,202
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.

859
00:57:41,239 --> 00:57:43,686
But this is Liverpool!

860
00:57:43,947 --> 00:57:48,736
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

861
00:57:49,188 --> 00:57:50,914
Now, if you’ll pardon me.

862
00:58:16,346 --> 00:58:19,361
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

863
00:58:20,337 --> 00:58:21,637
Who on earth made this...

864
00:58:22,422 --> 00:58:23,573
And for what reason?

865
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:29,451
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

866
00:58:29,495 --> 00:58:33,192
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

867
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:44,109
This is...

868
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,758
Dario Brando?

869
00:58:48,304 --> 00:58:50,717
Thank you again, Master Dio—

870
00:58:50,748 --> 00:58:53,518
Oh, it’s the least I could do.

871
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:57,464
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

872
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:00,166
“Right now... I’m sick.”

873
00:59:01,236 --> 00:59:02,768
“I’ll probably die.”

874
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:05,140
“My heart hurts,”

875
00:59:05,706 --> 00:59:06,879
“My hands shake,”

876
00:59:08,306 --> 00:59:10,032
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

877
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:18,526
<i>Dio...</i>

878
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:22,880
<i>Dio...</i>

879
00:59:23,334 --> 00:59:27,705
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

880
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:32,363
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

881
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:37,045
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

882
00:59:38,043 --> 00:59:41,241
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

883
00:59:41,342 --> 00:59:45,920
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

884
00:59:47,079 --> 00:59:50,039
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

885
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:55,285
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

886
00:59:55,332 --> 00:59:56,549
I know!

887
00:59:56,849 --> 01:00:00,856
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!

888
01:00:03,089 --> 01:00:07,813
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>

889
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,267
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>

890
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,974
I don’t bloody need it anymore!

891
01:00:12,014 --> 01:00:15,998
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

892
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,919
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>

893
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:20,528
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

894
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:28,442
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

895
01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:33,331
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

896
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,810
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>

897
01:00:38,943 --> 01:00:47,156
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

898
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:51,787
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

899
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:56,047
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

900
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:59,285
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

901
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:03,378
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

902
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,792
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

903
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:12,513
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

904
01:01:22,328 --> 01:01:23,328
Dio!

905
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:26,195
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

906
01:01:28,878 --> 01:01:30,100
What’s the matter, JoJo?

907
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:32,452
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

908
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:37,889
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.

909
01:01:39,006 --> 01:01:40,006
Huh?

910
01:01:40,547 --> 01:01:41,698
Show me that.

911
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,286
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

912
01:01:47,522 --> 01:01:49,752
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

913
01:01:50,955 --> 01:01:51,853
What is this non—

914
01:01:51,865 --> 01:01:52,865
Answer me!

915
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,829
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

916
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:57,787
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

917
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,549
JoJo...

918
01:02:03,221 --> 01:02:05,414
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,

919
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:08,078
Then you doubt our very friendship.

920
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:09,993
Dio,

921
01:02:10,745 --> 01:02:12,197
As a gentleman,

922
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:15,470
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.

923
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,711
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

924
01:02:19,062 --> 01:02:20,760
I’ll never speak of this again.

925
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:23,001
Swear on that guy?

926
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:24,876
Dio,

927
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:25,849
Swear on it.

928
01:02:25,863 --> 01:02:27,607
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!

929
01:02:27,628 --> 01:02:29,176
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!

930
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:30,583
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!

931
01:02:30,608 --> 01:02:33,348
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!

932
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,592
Give me the medicine back!

933
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:45,661
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

934
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,596
I’m convinced now...

935
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,768
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!

936
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:54,085
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

937
01:02:54,124 --> 01:02:55,740
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

938
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:58,127
Just a misunderstanding...

939
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:00,397
Besides...

940
01:03:02,138 --> 01:03:03,599
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?

941
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:06,457
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

942
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:08,885
Yes,

943
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:11,670
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

944
01:03:12,007 --> 01:03:14,886
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

945
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,874
JoJo! JoJo!!

946
01:03:18,558 --> 01:03:19,558
JoJo...

947
01:03:21,107 --> 01:03:22,943
Is something the matter, Master Dio?

948
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:24,937
No...

949
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,041
I’m alright...

950
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:36,031
<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

951
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,674
It’s too late to turn back now.

952
01:03:39,755 --> 01:03:43,057
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

953
01:03:43,578 --> 01:03:47,743
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

954
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,268
Father!

955
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:55,544
What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!

956
01:03:54,525 --> 01:03:55,525
-Father!

957
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,025
What’s all this ruckus for?

958
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,058
Father...

959
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,434
I’m going to London
for two or three days.

960
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:05,327
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.

961
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:09,569
Please don’t accept any care
or medicine from anyone else.

962
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:10,773
Excuse me, but—

963
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:13,414
We’ll do as he says.

964
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,917
I don’t know what’s going on...

965
01:04:16,434 --> 01:04:19,579
But I trust my son!

966
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,050
Thank you, Father.

967
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:31,629
Seven years ago, this thing...

968
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:35,715
It moved in reaction to my blood.

969
01:04:50,064 --> 01:04:51,475
With this...

970
01:04:54,554 --> 01:04:57,486
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

971
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:02,399
JoJo...

972
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:06,402
Your own research...

973
01:05:07,025 --> 01:05:09,511
Will be the death of you!

974
01:05:34,346 --> 01:05:38,503
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>

975
01:05:38,562 --> 01:05:41,812
<i>Turning my eyes to the stars
and praying for an antidote</i>

976
01:05:41,911 --> 01:05:46,014
<i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>

977
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:50,583
<i>Now I’ve arrived here
in this town steeped in mud</i>

978
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:54,069
<i>Ogre Street, the place
where plagues are born</i>

979
01:05:54,553 --> 01:05:57,873
<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>

980
01:05:57,939 --> 01:06:01,895
<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>

981
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:05,459
<i>Even if I were to lose
this right hand of mine</i>

982
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,609
<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>

983
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:08,713
<i>At long last our meeting takes place</i>

984
01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:10,549
<i>There’s a scent in the air
and it smells like prey</i>

985
01:06:10,574 --> 01:06:12,859
<i>Sniffing you out through the
storm someone’s making his way</i>

986
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:14,596
<i>It’s time for your
leader to take the stage</i>

987
01:06:14,647 --> 01:06:21,604
<i>(Ogre Street, we devour anything we can)</i>

988
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:30,968
<i>(Ogre Street, here everything meets its end)</i>

989
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,739
<i>Dunno what the hell
you came here for</i>

990
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:36,845
<i>Bet you thought you
stood a good chance, huh?</i>

991
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,879
<i>In a moment we’ll
devour all that hope</i>

992
01:06:38,902 --> 01:06:40,856
<i>This is Ogre Street and
we’re the ogres, duh!</i>

993
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:45,019
<i>Got no problem with you bein’ naïve,
I’m just showin’ you the simple reality</i>

994
01:06:45,079 --> 01:06:46,944
<i>Hey hey hey,
how about it, rich boy?</i>

995
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,946
<i>Want a taste of the
edge of this knife?</i>

996
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:52,679
<i>We’re gonna strip you of all that you got
Put up a fight and your life will be lost</i>

997
01:06:52,752 --> 01:06:56,583
<i>This is Ogre Street!
Ain’t it obvious that we’d cheat?</i>

998
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:58,549
<i>Us have-nots are gonna
steal your riches away!</i>

999
01:06:58,574 --> 01:07:01,027
<i>From your life to that foolish
heart—we’ll steal ‘em away!</i>

1000
01:07:01,147 --> 01:07:04,497
<i>Tail between your legs, you can
save your own skin by runnin’ away!</i>

1001
01:07:03,842 --> 01:07:05,342
{\an8}Is this guy insane?!

1002
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:11,697
<i>(Ogre Street, go on and leave it all behind)</i>

1003
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:14,069
{\an8}<i>I don’t care if I lose four fingers!</i>

1004
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:19,143
<i>(Ogre Street, we’ll even fill
our stomachs with your life)</i>

1005
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:23,127
<i>I came here for a reason!</i>

1006
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:31,380
<i>You said you’re fine with
losing four fingers, hah?</i>

1007
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:39,085
<i>(Ogre Street, why don’t we
put that resolve to the test?)</i>

1008
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:43,541
Hold on! I only came here
looking for a poison seller!

1009
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:47,486
Quit bluffin’! Let me have a
go at this soft little rich boy!

1010
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:07,118
That’s the sound of blade hitting bone!

1011
01:08:08,075 --> 01:08:11,454
<i>Made the mistake of my life, pickin’
a fight with this fearless tough guy</i>

1012
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,684
<i>Countdown to my final breath—</i>

1013
01:08:13,732 --> 01:08:15,732
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1014
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,119
Stop, everyone!

1015
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:34,911
I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!

1016
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:37,133
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?

1017
01:08:37,692 --> 01:08:39,354
I came here for the sake of my father.

1018
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:41,415
So in the moment I kicked,

1019
01:08:41,463 --> 01:08:44,075
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.

1020
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:47,694
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.

1021
01:08:50,734 --> 01:08:52,644
Tell me your name!

1022
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:55,880
Jonathan Joestar.

1023
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,708
Mr. Joestar, if you’re looking
for poison, that’d be Wang Chan.

1024
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:02,238
Be careful, he’s a crafty one!

1025
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:04,233
Someone bandage his wound.

1026
01:09:04,317 --> 01:09:06,555
I, Speedwagon, will lead you to his shop!

1027
01:09:06,617 --> 01:09:07,355
Why?!

1028
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:10,256
‘Cause I’ve taken a liking to ya!

1029
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,336
<i>(Ogre Street)</i>

1030
01:09:16,692 --> 01:09:20,552
<i>With your determination to fight</i>

1031
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:28,724
<i>(Ogre Street, you’ve lit in
us a glowing guiding light)</i>

1032
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:32,834
<i>(You, who have the courage)</i>

1033
01:09:32,912 --> 01:09:36,881
<i>(To see the stars down here in the mud)</i>

1034
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:44,954
<i>(Light up the darkness with
your unwavering heart!)</i>

1035
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:47,169
<i>Your refreshing sunlight</i>

1036
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,215
<i>Brought me completely to my knees</i>

1037
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,843
<i>This must be some
strange twist of fate!</i>

1038
01:09:50,885 --> 01:09:52,313
<i>Let’s toast—to our meeting!</i>

1039
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:14,943
JoJo...

1040
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:21,107
JoJo...!

1041
01:10:32,824 --> 01:10:36,074
<i>Dio...</i>

1042
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,061
JoJo has gone off to London...

1043
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:41,274
Could he have died a dog’s death already?

1044
01:10:41,849 --> 01:10:45,357
<i>Dio...</i>

1045
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,257
Or could he have found
evidence of the medicine?

1046
01:10:48,594 --> 01:10:49,594
Which is it?!

1047
01:10:50,408 --> 01:10:54,089
<i>Dio...</i>

1048
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,898
Booze! I can’t help but drink!

1049
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:03,535
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1050
01:11:03,577 --> 01:11:06,413
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

1051
01:11:06,058 --> 01:11:08,169
-Shut up, get out of my head!

1052
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:12,656
<i>You’re the only one I care about</i>

1053
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:16,930
<i>Become the richest man!</i>

1054
01:11:15,163 --> 01:11:17,351
-You piece of shit, we’re not the same!

1055
01:11:17,844 --> 01:11:20,337
Watch where you’re going, twat!

1056
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,216
Oi, are you listening, you stupid brat?

1057
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:27,440
You should ask yer mum to hold
you by the hand next time!

1058
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:30,041
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1059
01:11:27,687 --> 01:11:29,833
Didn’t you hear me?

1060
01:11:30,086 --> 01:11:32,778
Oi! You piece of shit—

1061
01:11:30,364 --> 01:11:33,896
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1062
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:39,150
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1063
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:39,568
You filthy old tramps with
no sense of personal hygiene...

1064
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,438
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1065
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,602
How dare you! You bastard!

1066
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:44,763
What did you do to my mate?!

1067
01:11:45,056 --> 01:11:49,183
{\an8}<i>One man’s misfortune...</i>

1068
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,006
I’ll kill you!

1069
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:51,974
{\an8}<i>Is another man’s fortune!</i>

1070
01:11:51,222 --> 01:11:54,001
Interesting, this is a good
opportunity to try it out!

1071
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:55,481
{\an8}<i>You’re my clever boy!</i>

1072
01:11:54,028 --> 01:11:55,671
What’re you mumbling about?!

1073
01:11:57,299 --> 01:11:59,813
It’s a live human experiment!

1074
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:06,245
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1075
01:12:04,884 --> 01:12:06,514
JoJo!

1076
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:10,508
I’ll find the answer to your
research myself right now!

1077
01:12:09,947 --> 01:12:14,362
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1078
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:17,450
What...

1079
01:12:19,242 --> 01:12:20,242
What—

1080
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:25,934
{\an8}<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

1081
01:12:21,852 --> 01:12:24,051
What is this light?

1082
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:28,759
Was I hallucinating?

1083
01:12:30,857 --> 01:12:32,157
He’s dead...

1084
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,640
The spikes pierced so deep into his skull,
it must have killed him instantly.

1085
01:12:35,738 --> 01:12:39,094
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.

1086
01:12:39,777 --> 01:12:41,235
He’s not dead!

1087
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:46,124
Fangs?! What is he?!

1088
01:13:07,518 --> 01:13:12,056
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>

1089
01:13:12,157 --> 01:13:14,343
He’s sucking my blood!

1090
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:17,830
His face is...

1091
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,468
Becoming younger?!

1092
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:27,296
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!

1093
01:13:43,462 --> 01:13:45,063
I was saved...

1094
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,288
By the sunlight...

1095
01:13:56,843 --> 01:13:58,329
He turned into ash...

1096
01:14:03,817 --> 01:14:04,539
Ow!

1097
01:14:09,472 --> 01:14:10,572
So this...

1098
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:16,453
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1099
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:23,258
So, where is Dio?

1100
01:14:23,277 --> 01:14:24,960
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1101
01:14:24,977 --> 01:14:26,326
I’ll call for reinforcements right away.

1102
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:27,418
Please use the foyer.

1103
01:14:27,453 --> 01:14:28,357
Thank you.

1104
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:29,567
-You there!
-Sir!

1105
01:14:29,603 --> 01:14:31,995
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1106
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:32,862
Yes sir!

1107
01:14:36,368 --> 01:14:38,243
Oi, come on!

1108
01:14:39,468 --> 01:14:40,468
JoJo...

1109
01:14:41,026 --> 01:14:42,280
I apologise.

1110
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:44,427
This is my cross to bear.

1111
01:14:45,172 --> 01:14:46,077
What?

1112
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:49,548
If only I had made sure
that man was exiled...

1113
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:51,174
Dio’s father...

1114
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:53,219
Dario Brando.

1115
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:55,648
What do you mean?

1116
01:14:56,924 --> 01:14:59,417
I’ll tell you about it.

1117
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:03,597
This happened when you were a baby.

1118
01:15:05,103 --> 01:15:08,793
This is certainly my ring,

1119
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,887
But I never reported a theft.

1120
01:15:11,932 --> 01:15:15,209
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.

1121
01:15:15,684 --> 01:15:22,064
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1122
01:15:22,111 --> 01:15:23,988
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1123
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:29,410
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1124
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,683
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,

1125
01:15:35,272 --> 01:15:37,156
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1126
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:38,761
I...

1127
01:15:39,314 --> 01:15:40,828
I arrested the criminal!

1128
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,293
Would you like to see for yourself?

1129
01:15:42,339 --> 01:15:44,657
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1130
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:46,932
He’s certain to be exiled!

1131
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:48,721
I see.

1132
01:15:49,438 --> 01:15:54,219
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1133
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:56,398
Brando?!

1134
01:15:56,411 --> 01:15:57,682
Oh, bollocks.

1135
01:15:57,739 --> 01:15:58,295
Then that means—

1136
01:15:58,342 --> 01:16:01,386
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,

1137
01:16:01,444 --> 01:16:02,809
But a thief!

1138
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:08,495
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1139
01:16:10,464 --> 01:16:11,464
Why?

1140
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,692
I...

1141
01:16:13,308 --> 01:16:15,869
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1142
01:16:20,058 --> 01:16:24,230
Did he tell you...

1143
01:16:25,186 --> 01:16:28,443
That I gave him this ring?

1144
01:16:28,526 --> 01:16:30,518
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1145
01:16:30,536 --> 01:16:31,675
It’s not a lie.

1146
01:16:32,445 --> 01:16:35,577
This is what I gave him.

1147
01:16:36,184 --> 01:16:37,736
He is innocent.

1148
01:16:37,756 --> 01:16:39,759
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1149
01:16:39,783 --> 01:16:40,783
Mr. Brando,

1150
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:43,110
This is yours.

1151
01:16:43,692 --> 01:16:48,499
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.

1152
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:51,204
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1153
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:08,782
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1154
01:17:10,394 --> 01:17:20,799
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>

1155
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:33,345
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>

1156
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:47,249
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>

1157
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:49,336
Thank you, sir!

1158
01:17:50,057 --> 01:17:53,546
You are too good-natured!

1159
01:17:53,588 --> 01:17:57,449
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!

1160
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:00,882
That may be true,

1161
01:18:01,493 --> 01:18:04,342
But think about it the other way around.

1162
01:18:05,044 --> 01:18:15,227
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>

1163
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:25,348
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>

1164
01:18:25,892 --> 01:18:29,896
<i>That pain</i>

1165
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:36,749
<i>Everything is connected</i>

1166
01:18:36,818 --> 01:18:42,929
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1167
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:53,023
<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>

1168
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:55,523
I can’t see stars or nothin’!
That’s bollocks!

1169
01:18:55,624 --> 01:18:56,862
That’s why...

1170
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:04,011
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1171
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:10,154
<i>That this gold I’ve passed on</i>

1172
01:19:10,564 --> 01:19:16,131
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1173
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:20,762
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>

1174
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:37,110
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1175
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:42,292
Inspector.

1176
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:45,360
I’ll wait for Dio.

1177
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:49,062
He can still be stopped.

1178
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:15,259
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1179
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:20,000
It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.

1180
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,640
And then...

1181
01:20:23,244 --> 01:20:27,156
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.

1182
01:20:29,774 --> 01:20:35,752
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...

1183
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:45,293
<i>It’s a wedge driven into
the wasteland of my memory</i>

1184
01:20:46,273 --> 01:20:55,378
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

1185
01:20:56,327 --> 01:21:05,303
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>

1186
01:21:05,515 --> 01:21:14,417
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>

1187
01:21:14,588 --> 01:21:23,228
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>

1188
01:21:24,346 --> 01:21:33,049
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>

1189
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:38,255
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1190
01:21:38,335 --> 01:21:42,426
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1191
01:21:42,471 --> 01:21:45,875
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>

1192
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:52,507
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”

1193
01:21:52,542 --> 01:21:55,931
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1194
01:21:58,564 --> 01:21:59,960
The Stone Mask...

1195
01:22:01,295 --> 01:22:04,472
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1196
01:22:18,104 --> 01:22:19,625
I, Dio, was...

1197
01:22:23,718 --> 01:22:24,718
Shit...

1198
01:22:28,727 --> 01:22:29,727
JoJo...

1199
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,781
I see you’ve returned from London—

1200
01:22:35,804 --> 01:22:37,425
I have the antidote now.

1201
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:45,562
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1202
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:47,836
It truly hurts me.

1203
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,662
Although you might not believe me,

1204
01:22:54,127 --> 01:22:55,628
Those are my true feelings.

1205
01:23:01,673 --> 01:23:03,207
I understand, JoJo.

1206
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:07,451
You’re honest like that.

1207
01:23:11,503 --> 01:23:13,361
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1208
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:16,815
The final one
I will ask of you.

1209
01:23:18,085 --> 01:23:19,919
Can you give me more time?

1210
01:23:21,318 --> 01:23:22,318
Time—

1211
01:23:24,286 --> 01:23:25,813
To turn myself in to the police.

1212
01:23:27,275 --> 01:23:28,275
Eh?

1213
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:31,203
I...

1214
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,699
R-Regret the choices I’ve
made throughout my life.

1215
01:23:40,704 --> 01:23:42,739
Because I was born into squalor...

1216
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:48,356
My ambition was relentless.

1217
01:23:52,411 --> 01:23:54,180
What I did was terrible!

1218
01:23:57,261 --> 01:23:59,315
I want to repent for my sins!

1219
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,847
Don’t believe a word he says!

1220
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:14,974
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1221
01:24:15,027 --> 01:24:17,010
Allow me to introduce myself!

1222
01:24:17,564 --> 01:24:20,065
I’m Speedwagon, the meddler!

1223
01:24:20,818 --> 01:24:23,808
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1224
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:26,352
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.

1225
01:24:26,884 --> 01:24:29,650
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.

1226
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:35,423
This guy reeks!

1227
01:24:35,449 --> 01:24:38,390
Worse than vomit!

1228
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,486
He was born evil!

1229
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:43,224
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1230
01:24:45,737 --> 01:24:47,795
This man has confessed already.

1231
01:24:50,445 --> 01:24:51,270
Father...

1232
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,784
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1233
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:01,243
I will return to my bed to rest.

1234
01:25:03,802 --> 01:25:09,563
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1235
01:25:10,858 --> 01:25:13,615
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1236
01:25:14,361 --> 01:25:17,034
He was born with an innate destiny.

1237
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,079
Silence!

1238
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:19,397
Come on—

1239
01:25:22,171 --> 01:25:23,729
JoJo, I understand!

1240
01:25:25,181 --> 01:25:26,579
Arrest me.

1241
01:25:27,637 --> 01:25:29,065
But, if it’s not too much to ask;

1242
01:25:29,309 --> 01:25:31,128
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1243
01:25:32,038 --> 01:25:34,130
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1244
01:25:34,377 --> 01:25:35,377
Be careful!

1245
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:37,841
Agreed.

1246
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,337
I will handcuff you.

1247
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:52,992
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1248
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:58,645
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1249
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:03,837
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1250
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:09,015
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1251
01:26:09,044 --> 01:26:10,044
What’re you talking about?

1252
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,080
<i>You know, JoJo...</i>

1253
01:26:11,642 --> 01:26:14,924
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1254
01:26:15,699 --> 01:26:22,511
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1255
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:33,017
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1256
01:26:34,473 --> 01:26:39,285
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1257
01:26:39,886 --> 01:26:43,658
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>

1258
01:26:44,929 --> 01:26:47,160
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1259
01:26:47,187 --> 01:26:49,527
<i>That murky sky up there,</i>

1260
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:54,711
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1261
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:59,518
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1262
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:04,047
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1263
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,382
<i>That’s why, now is the time</i>

1264
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,661
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1265
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:10,960
<i>And seize...</i>

1266
01:27:11,388 --> 01:27:14,419
<i>The stars!</i>

1267
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:17,804
The Stone Mask?

1268
01:27:20,646 --> 01:27:22,214
<i>I...</i>

1269
01:27:25,884 --> 01:27:26,884
<i>I...</i>

1270
01:27:29,282 --> 01:27:32,330
<i>Reject...</i>

1271
01:27:33,308 --> 01:27:37,730
<i>My humanity!</i>

1272
01:27:38,512 --> 01:27:42,629
<i>JoJo!</i>

1273
01:27:42,685 --> 01:27:43,948
Stop!

1274
01:27:46,579 --> 01:27:47,725
-JoJo!
-Father!

1275
01:27:47,927 --> 01:27:48,927
Dio!

1276
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:50,451
Dio!

1277
01:27:55,179 --> 01:27:58,245
Shoot him!

1278
01:27:58,546 --> 01:28:01,236
Shoot him!

1279
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:04,571
Lord Joestar!

1280
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:06,856
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

1281
01:28:06,879 --> 01:28:08,488
Father! Father!

1282
01:28:11,307 --> 01:28:12,307
JoJo...

1283
01:28:15,543 --> 01:28:16,543
This is...

1284
01:28:20,858 --> 01:28:23,572
Your late mother’s ring.

1285
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:25,827
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1286
01:28:29,425 --> 01:28:33,633
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

1287
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:40,768
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...

1288
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,844
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.

1289
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:49,035
Father...

1290
01:28:56,448 --> 01:28:58,547
It’s not so bad...

1291
01:29:00,823 --> 01:29:01,823
JoJo...

1292
01:29:07,174 --> 01:29:08,529
To die...

1293
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:16,780
In my son’s arms.

1294
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:32,903
Father?

1295
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:37,376
How could this be...

1296
01:29:38,662 --> 01:29:42,270
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1297
01:29:43,072 --> 01:29:45,577
Now he’s dead and there’s
no bringing him back.

1298
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,844
Mr. Joestar...

1299
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:55,220
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1300
01:29:56,877 --> 01:30:01,530
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1301
01:30:04,353 --> 01:30:10,005
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1302
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:17,397
<i>Even though you said you believed me!</i>

1303
01:30:19,387 --> 01:30:24,890
<i>I couldn’t protect you—
How could I be so powerless?</i>

1304
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:29,597
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>

1305
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:33,835
<i>Father, open your eyes!</i>

1306
01:30:33,952 --> 01:30:36,956
<i>What’s pride worth now?</i>

1307
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:39,583
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>

1308
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:48,365
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body?</i>

1309
01:30:49,365 --> 01:30:54,964
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1310
01:30:56,662 --> 01:31:03,321
<i>Carrying yourself with
discipline and pride</i>

1311
01:31:04,115 --> 01:31:11,359
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1312
01:31:11,785 --> 01:31:17,108
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>

1313
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:24,735
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1314
01:31:26,538 --> 01:31:33,838
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1315
01:31:34,183 --> 01:31:39,298
<i>It will become the future,
sent up to the stars</i>

1316
01:31:40,727 --> 01:31:48,284
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1317
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:53,831
<i>Everything is connected,
there’s a meaning to it all</i>

1318
01:31:55,913 --> 01:32:01,238
<i>I’ll fight against this fate,
keep sorrow at bay</i>

1319
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:08,003
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1320
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:20,756
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1321
01:32:20,795 --> 01:32:21,658
What’s wrong?

1322
01:32:21,682 --> 01:32:24,808
The body... Dio’s body is gone!

1323
01:32:24,847 --> 01:32:25,934
What?!

1324
01:32:26,244 --> 01:32:27,343
What did you say?!

1325
01:32:29,238 --> 01:32:31,434
Oi copper, get away from the window!

1326
01:32:32,758 --> 01:32:34,551
Inspector!

1327
01:32:42,561 --> 01:32:45,085
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1328
01:32:45,113 --> 01:32:47,168
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1329
01:32:47,204 --> 01:32:49,799
Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!

1330
01:32:50,768 --> 01:32:51,768
Dio!

1331
01:32:52,106 --> 01:32:53,106
Stop!

1332
01:32:55,363 --> 01:32:58,360
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!

1333
01:33:06,724 --> 01:33:10,126
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads
or tails of what’s happening!

1334
01:33:11,483 --> 01:33:13,203
JoJo!

1335
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:18,693
Can you hear my voice?

1336
01:33:19,373 --> 01:33:20,903
H-He’s sucking his blood!

1337
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,666
You’re—

1338
01:33:34,688 --> 01:33:37,470
JoJo...

1339
01:33:37,527 --> 01:33:44,434
I’ve gained such incredible power!

1340
01:33:45,672 --> 01:33:48,004
From the Stone Mask...

1341
01:33:49,705 --> 01:33:54,104
From your father’s blood!

1342
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:55,217
Dio!

1343
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:57,741
These monsters are
making <i>more</i> monsters?!

1344
01:33:57,793 --> 01:34:00,180
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1345
01:34:00,206 --> 01:34:02,238
That monster is too bloody strong!

1346
01:34:07,857 --> 01:34:08,704
The brain!

1347
01:34:09,124 --> 01:34:12,604
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!

1348
01:34:13,372 --> 01:34:14,528
If that’s the case...

1349
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:18,584
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!

1350
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:29,030
Stop!

1351
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:30,064
Speedwagon!

1352
01:34:38,342 --> 01:34:39,654
I must...

1353
01:34:41,255 --> 01:34:43,801
I must make my will stronger!

1354
01:34:58,952 --> 01:35:00,847
JoJo!

1355
01:35:04,082 --> 01:35:07,656
Weak! So weak!

1356
01:35:11,704 --> 01:35:12,918
Mr. Joestar!

1357
01:35:12,931 --> 01:35:13,986
Let me...

1358
01:35:14,022 --> 01:35:19,157
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1359
01:35:19,628 --> 01:35:25,073
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1360
01:35:33,175 --> 01:35:36,180
JoJo...

1361
01:35:37,212 --> 01:35:41,384
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1362
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:44,484
I told you, didn’t I?

1363
01:35:45,447 --> 01:35:48,067
No matter how many
tricks you come up with,

1364
01:35:48,815 --> 01:35:52,397
Humans have limits!

1365
01:35:54,885 --> 01:35:59,999
Quit hiding behind that
curtain! Come out here!

1366
01:36:01,257 --> 01:36:06,411
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1367
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:11,823
Dio!

1368
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:13,826
This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!

1369
01:36:14,474 --> 01:36:15,521
It’s courage!

1370
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:19,563
This fire won’t kill him.

1371
01:36:20,273 --> 01:36:22,832
Speedwagon, escape from the mansion.

1372
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,880
What?

1373
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,500
Mr. Joestar!

1374
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,762
Don’t run upstairs!

1375
01:36:39,812 --> 01:36:45,135
<i>(The flash of flames,
illuminating the dark)</i>

1376
01:36:45,915 --> 01:36:48,484
<i>Come, Dio.</i>

1377
01:36:48,934 --> 01:36:51,958
<i>I’m up here.</i>

1378
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:54,945
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1379
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:58,570
<i>Very well, I’ll take care of you first</i>

1380
01:36:58,658 --> 01:37:03,927
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1381
01:37:04,914 --> 01:37:10,366
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>

1382
01:37:10,434 --> 01:37:12,595
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1383
01:37:12,676 --> 01:37:17,397
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1384
01:37:17,465 --> 01:37:20,211
<i>(The flames are pulsing)</i>

1385
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:26,793
<i>JOJO: Father! I’ll mourn you
DIO: I offer you my thanks</i>

1386
01:37:22,695 --> 01:37:26,517
{\an8}<i>(Flickering from light to dark)</i>

1387
01:37:26,856 --> 01:37:31,582
<i>JOJO: Please give me strength
DIO: For giving me strength</i>

1388
01:37:31,635 --> 01:37:36,021
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1389
01:37:36,071 --> 01:37:40,144
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1390
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:43,902
<i>My youth was with you</i>

1391
01:37:44,385 --> 01:37:48,706
<i>It’s time for us to say goodbye to it</i>

1392
01:37:48,761 --> 01:37:49,761
JoJo!

1393
01:37:49,902 --> 01:37:53,269
<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

1394
01:37:53,324 --> 01:37:55,324
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1395
01:37:56,211 --> 01:38:01,846
<i>I’ve lost everything, save for my life</i>

1396
01:38:02,492 --> 01:38:08,476
<i>I’ll let that burn to ash too.
I’ll stop you, Dio!</i>

1397
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:22,013
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

1398
01:38:22,065 --> 01:38:27,722
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

1399
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:31,916
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

1400
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:34,848
The fire had already engulfed the
mansion, even overtaking the roof.

1401
01:38:34,903 --> 01:38:39,375
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

1402
01:39:11,872 --> 01:39:14,501
This body is immortal.

1403
01:39:15,311 --> 01:39:18,922
The only one dying will be you!

1404
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:24,472
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1405
01:39:24,519 --> 01:39:28,259
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1406
01:39:28,527 --> 01:39:32,449
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1407
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:36,855
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1408
01:39:35,286 --> 01:39:36,786
-JoJo!

1409
01:39:36,951 --> 01:39:41,056
<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

1410
01:39:41,095 --> 01:39:43,474
The knife you stabbed Father with!

1411
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,516
It’s useless! I’m immortal!

1412
01:39:45,575 --> 01:39:53,486
<i>With this final bit of strength</i>

1413
01:39:46,492 --> 01:39:49,651
{\an8}<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1414
01:39:49,707 --> 01:39:53,413
{\an8}<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1415
01:39:53,617 --> 01:39:57,800
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1416
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:02,408
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1417
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:07,534
<i>This can’t be how my life ends—</i>

1418
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:12,480
JoJo!!

1419
01:41:13,105 --> 01:41:14,452
Can you hear me?

1420
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:18,579
You can hear me.

1421
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:21,874
Good.

1422
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,467
I hope you had a nice intermission.

1423
01:41:30,794 --> 01:41:34,656
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,

1424
01:41:35,259 --> 01:41:39,799
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

1425
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:44,211
And so that we can continue our
<i>show</i> of love for these characters.

1426
01:41:45,205 --> 01:41:47,811
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

1427
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:56,519
Just a few more until it’s complete!

1428
01:41:57,772 --> 01:42:03,153
I hope you get the merch
you’re looking for too.

1429
01:42:08,018 --> 01:42:12,407
Well, let’s continue where we left off.

1430
01:42:13,576 --> 01:42:18,311
The story up to this point
seems like a bit of a fairytale, but...

1431
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,958
Make no mistake, it’s the truth.

1432
01:42:21,515 --> 01:42:26,425
Things are going to get more
and more bizarre from here on out.

1433
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:27,950
Yes.

1434
01:42:28,304 --> 01:42:30,179
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.

1435
01:42:31,123 --> 01:42:35,486
Previously, the mansion was
shrouded in flames and burnt down...

1436
01:42:36,213 --> 01:42:39,228
But Mr. Joestar survived.

1437
01:42:40,093 --> 01:42:41,877
He beat Dio,

1438
01:42:42,563 --> 01:42:45,460
But lost everything.

1439
01:42:46,094 --> 01:42:48,640
Three days later...

1440
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,449
I found it!

1441
01:43:13,492 --> 01:43:15,492
The mask that man wore!

1442
01:43:15,623 --> 01:43:17,733
If I have this mask—

1443
01:43:17,771 --> 01:43:20,799
<i>JoJo...</i>

1444
01:43:21,753 --> 01:43:24,815
<i>JoJo...</i>

1445
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,791
<i>JoJo...</i>

1446
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,288
<i>JoJo...</i>

1447
01:43:34,133 --> 01:43:38,276
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

1448
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:42,833
<i>My voice calling for you?</i>

1449
01:43:46,225 --> 01:43:51,003
After carrying the unconscious Mr. Joestar
to the hospital, I came back to visit him!

1450
01:43:51,065 --> 01:43:52,968
I’m not much,

1451
01:43:53,331 --> 01:43:56,751
But I want to do what I can at least,

1452
01:43:56,783 --> 01:43:58,825
To give him some small
hope to keep on living!

1453
01:44:00,422 --> 01:44:01,532
Can I help you?

1454
01:44:02,032 --> 01:44:04,043
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

1455
01:44:04,343 --> 01:44:06,090
But that’s why I’m here!

1456
01:44:06,112 --> 01:44:08,199
I’m doing enough for him as his nurse.

1457
01:44:08,222 --> 01:44:09,948
Please come back some other day.

1458
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,994
Is he alright?! Oi, hold it—

1459
01:44:24,601 --> 01:44:26,852
<i>JoJo...</i>

1460
01:44:28,838 --> 01:44:31,079
<i>JoJo...</i>

1461
01:44:33,843 --> 01:44:36,980
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1462
01:44:37,358 --> 01:44:40,966
<i>My voice,</i>

1463
01:44:41,012 --> 01:44:45,176
<i>You recognise it, right?</i>

1464
01:44:46,283 --> 01:44:54,269
<i>From that bright, fleeting moment
when we were drawn together</i>

1465
01:44:54,861 --> 01:45:00,325
<i>I want to hear your voice again too</i>

1466
01:45:06,766 --> 01:45:07,866
Where am I...?

1467
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:15,764
You slept for three whole days!

1468
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:18,875
The mansion! Everyone is—

1469
01:45:18,894 --> 01:45:20,449
Please, just relax for now!

1470
01:45:20,705 --> 01:45:23,750
You’ve made it through the worst
of it, but you’re still in bad shape!

1471
01:45:24,994 --> 01:45:26,976
I’m so glad you’re alive!

1472
01:45:27,278 --> 01:45:28,902
Have you been caring
for me this whole—

1473
01:45:29,804 --> 01:45:30,804
You’re—

1474
01:45:31,546 --> 01:45:32,646
No, it couldn’t be.

1475
01:45:34,788 --> 01:45:35,865
But you look like...

1476
01:45:36,453 --> 01:45:38,175
Look like who?

1477
01:45:38,196 --> 01:45:39,872
Like Erina Pendleton?

1478
01:45:41,814 --> 01:45:44,793
It’s been a while, Jonathan Joestar.

1479
01:45:45,232 --> 01:45:46,232
How?

1480
01:45:46,519 --> 01:45:48,277
This is my father’s hospital.

1481
01:45:48,765 --> 01:45:53,021
We moved to India seven years
ago, and just recently returned.

1482
01:45:54,845 --> 01:45:56,681
It’s really been too long.

1483
01:45:58,036 --> 01:46:06,019
<i>I was weak back then,
I couldn’t run to your side</i>

1484
01:46:06,154 --> 01:46:14,359
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

1485
01:46:15,094 --> 01:46:18,510
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

1486
01:46:19,156 --> 01:46:22,728
<i>My feelings are still the same</i>

1487
01:46:23,258 --> 01:46:29,886
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

1488
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:32,666
<i>Erina</i>

1489
01:46:32,933 --> 01:46:34,721
<i>JoJo</i>

1490
01:46:35,524 --> 01:46:38,476
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

1491
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:46,399
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

1492
01:46:53,437 --> 01:46:54,437
Erina!

1493
01:46:55,462 --> 01:46:58,185
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

1494
01:46:58,739 --> 01:47:00,715
My goodness, you caught
me with your broken arm!

1495
01:47:00,761 --> 01:47:02,584
I’ll always be there to catch you.

1496
01:47:03,834 --> 01:47:05,659
<i>When our</i>

1497
01:47:05,706 --> 01:47:07,706
<i>Eyes meet</i>

1498
01:47:08,474 --> 01:47:11,606
<i>I can see it there</i>

1499
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:18,969
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

1500
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:22,042
<i>Your hand</i>

1501
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:24,102
<i>Meets mine</i>

1502
01:47:24,721 --> 01:47:27,594
<i>I can feel you there</i>

1503
01:47:27,652 --> 01:47:34,723
<i>Our fates entwined forever</i>

1504
01:47:35,264 --> 01:47:44,041
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

1505
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:49,366
<i>Drawn together on that fleeting day</i>

1506
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:54,191
<i>We’ll continue from there</i>

1507
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:58,249
<i>Just the two of us</i>

1508
01:48:00,489 --> 01:48:02,849
Fate? That’s right.

1509
01:48:03,152 --> 01:48:09,040
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

1510
01:48:10,413 --> 01:48:13,544
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

1511
01:48:26,973 --> 01:48:31,750
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1512
01:48:32,481 --> 01:48:36,257
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

1513
01:48:36,298 --> 01:48:39,475
<i>It was the same method, another woman—</i>

1514
01:48:39,515 --> 01:48:42,975
<i>Her throat was slit</i>

1515
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:46,658
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

1516
01:48:47,185 --> 01:48:50,550
<i>The utmost cruelty!</i>

1517
01:48:50,809 --> 01:48:54,081
<i>No known motive at all!</i>

1518
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:57,421
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

1519
01:48:57,629 --> 01:49:01,304
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

1520
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:05,152
<i>(Don’t go out walking at night!)</i>

1521
01:49:05,361 --> 01:49:08,735
<i>(You’ll be killed! He’ll find you!)</i>

1522
01:49:08,828 --> 01:49:15,965
<i>(The plague of London,
that bloodthirsty killer!)</i>

1523
01:49:16,052 --> 01:49:23,189
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

1524
01:49:23,268 --> 01:49:29,640
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

1525
01:49:29,695 --> 01:49:32,798
<i>Jack the Ripper!</i>

1526
01:49:33,653 --> 01:49:35,438
You’re kidding!

1527
01:49:35,732 --> 01:49:37,343
Oh, it’s already so late!

1528
01:49:38,015 --> 01:49:40,162
I have to return home soon...

1529
01:49:40,192 --> 01:49:42,763
It’s not late at all!

1530
01:49:43,251 --> 01:49:46,501
But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!

1531
01:49:47,602 --> 01:49:49,619
It’s a terrifying thought!

1532
01:49:49,643 --> 01:49:51,673
Terrifying, is it?

1533
01:49:51,692 --> 01:49:52,692
It is!

1534
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:56,606
Well, as a matter of fact...

1535
01:49:56,821 --> 01:50:02,352
You’re talking with him right now!

1536
01:50:12,338 --> 01:50:15,086
You’re out playing too late,

1537
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:20,482
You dirty harlot!

1538
01:50:25,914 --> 01:50:27,014
Who goes there?

1539
01:50:27,705 --> 01:50:28,960
You...

1540
01:50:29,994 --> 01:50:31,538
I like you.

1541
01:50:34,103 --> 01:50:36,444
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

1542
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:48,227
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

1543
01:50:48,287 --> 01:50:53,184
<i>I’ve been reborn, now’s the
time for my life to start!</i>

1544
01:50:53,243 --> 01:50:58,362
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

1545
01:50:58,486 --> 01:51:01,333
<i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>

1546
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:04,741
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

1547
01:51:05,097 --> 01:51:07,343
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1548
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:11,755
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

1549
01:51:10,745 --> 01:51:11,845
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1550
01:51:14,652 --> 01:51:17,224
Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

1551
01:51:17,252 --> 01:51:19,463
They fear that which is spectacularly evil.

1552
01:51:19,493 --> 01:51:22,414
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

1553
01:51:22,459 --> 01:51:27,132
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

1554
01:51:27,468 --> 01:51:29,887
How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?

1555
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,104
What do you know about me?!

1556
01:51:35,632 --> 01:51:40,746
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

1557
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:43,313
<i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>

1558
01:51:43,344 --> 01:51:45,995
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

1559
01:51:46,055 --> 01:51:51,393
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

1560
01:51:51,441 --> 01:51:54,338
Me, afraid?!

1561
01:51:51,479 --> 01:51:54,027
{\an8}<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1562
01:51:54,427 --> 01:51:55,688
That’s right!

1563
01:51:54,206 --> 01:51:55,306
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1564
01:51:56,664 --> 01:51:59,466
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

1565
01:51:59,502 --> 01:52:02,772
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

1566
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:07,013
<i>I’m not scared of anything!</i>

1567
01:52:07,141 --> 01:52:12,593
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

1568
01:52:12,631 --> 01:52:13,631
<i>You—</i>

1569
01:52:13,672 --> 01:52:17,141
<i>Come to my side, Jack the Ripper!</i>

1570
01:52:17,181 --> 01:52:20,480
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1571
01:52:20,517 --> 01:52:23,436
<i>Who are you?</i>

1572
01:52:23,597 --> 01:52:28,121
<i>Seeing stars, or seeing mud?</i>

1573
01:52:28,187 --> 01:52:34,072
<i>We’ll change the tune of
that tired old philosophy!</i>

1574
01:52:34,131 --> 01:52:38,376
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

1575
01:52:38,434 --> 01:52:44,076
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

1576
01:52:44,353 --> 01:52:46,750
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1577
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,109
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

1578
01:52:46,965 --> 01:52:49,351
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1579
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:52,082
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1580
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:53,842
{\an8}<i>(Blood! Flesh!)</i>

1581
01:52:53,655 --> 01:53:00,026
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1582
01:53:31,066 --> 01:53:32,216
The Stone Mask...

1583
01:53:33,942 --> 01:53:36,908
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

1584
01:53:38,209 --> 01:53:39,145
Yes.

1585
01:53:40,294 --> 01:53:41,394
It has to have been.

1586
01:53:45,024 --> 01:53:46,124
It’s alright.

1587
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:47,970
I’m alright.

1588
01:53:48,104 --> 01:53:49,104
Let’s go.

1589
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:54,199
Eh?

1590
01:53:54,746 --> 01:53:55,846
What’s wrong?

1591
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,460
Who’s that?

1592
01:53:58,382 --> 01:53:59,324
Has he been here
this whole time?

1593
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:01,017
Jonathan Joestar!

1594
01:54:01,685 --> 01:54:04,654
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

1595
01:54:09,453 --> 01:54:13,787
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

1596
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:14,983
The Stone Mask?!

1597
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:18,668
JoJo!

1598
01:54:21,177 --> 01:54:22,280
<i>(Pow!)</i>

1599
01:54:22,715 --> 01:54:24,437
<i>Squeeze out</i>

1600
01:54:25,193 --> 01:54:26,566
<i>Every last ounce</i>

1601
01:54:27,896 --> 01:54:31,114
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

1602
01:54:31,208 --> 01:54:32,920
How could you, he’s injured!

1603
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:37,571
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

1604
01:54:37,615 --> 01:54:39,994
<i>I am Baron Zeppeli!</i>

1605
01:54:40,244 --> 01:54:44,330
<i>Courage alone won’t defeat
the power of the Stone Mask</i>

1606
01:54:44,367 --> 01:54:46,494
<i>I am on your side!</i>

1607
01:54:47,307 --> 01:54:51,990
<i>I manipulated your breath, your
breath made the pain go away</i>

1608
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:56,137
<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

1609
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:57,588
Who are you?

1610
01:54:57,605 --> 01:54:59,247
What did you do to me?!

1611
01:54:59,265 --> 01:55:00,733
How do you know my name!

1612
01:55:00,766 --> 01:55:05,061
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

1613
01:55:05,556 --> 01:55:09,318
<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

1614
01:55:09,826 --> 01:55:13,749
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

1615
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:16,396
<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>

1616
01:55:16,425 --> 01:55:18,822
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

1617
01:55:23,655 --> 01:55:25,497
What will happen now?

1618
01:55:27,137 --> 01:55:31,485
<i>Let me demonstrate for you</i>

1619
01:55:32,179 --> 01:55:36,970
<i>The power that this breathing awakens!</i>

1620
01:55:37,508 --> 01:55:39,413
<i>(Breathe in, breathe out)</i>

1621
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,093
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1622
01:55:42,129 --> 01:55:43,502
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1623
01:55:44,474 --> 01:55:46,014
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1624
01:55:46,028 --> 01:55:47,028
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1625
01:55:46,442 --> 01:55:48,371
<i>With this special breathing</i>

1626
01:55:47,676 --> 01:55:48,954
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1627
01:55:48,693 --> 01:55:50,959
<i>You carry special oxygen</i>

1628
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:51,556
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1629
01:55:51,036 --> 01:55:53,099
<i>In the blood it sends racing</i>

1630
01:55:53,148 --> 01:55:55,456
<i>All throughout your body!</i>

1631
01:55:55,443 --> 01:55:56,443
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1632
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,830
<i>And energy is born!</i>

1633
01:55:56,963 --> 01:55:58,384
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1634
01:55:58,412 --> 01:56:00,430
<i>Its name is—</i>

1635
01:55:59,470 --> 01:56:00,873
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1636
01:56:00,456 --> 01:56:02,734
<i>Ripple Energy!</i>

1637
01:56:12,798 --> 01:56:14,258
<i>(Memetaa!)</i>

1638
01:56:12,802 --> 01:56:14,252
{\an8}[TN: Sound of a frog being punched]

1639
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:18,442
<i>The ripple’s power
passes through the frog</i>

1640
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:23,003
<i>Making this miracle happen—</i>

1641
01:56:23,287 --> 01:56:26,952
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

1642
01:56:27,002 --> 01:56:31,974
<i>The power this breathing
infuses into your blood!</i>

1643
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:35,290
<i>(In, out)</i>

1644
01:56:36,291 --> 01:56:37,783
<i>(In, out)</i>

1645
01:56:37,836 --> 01:56:38,623
Breathing?

1646
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:42,461
Everyone has a little bit of energy
flowing through their bloodstream.

1647
01:56:42,505 --> 01:56:45,354
It does things like carry nutrients
and regulate your body temperature.

1648
01:56:45,396 --> 01:56:49,769
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.

1649
01:56:49,816 --> 01:56:53,424
This is made possible by the rhythm
of a particular breathing technique.

1650
01:56:53,453 --> 01:56:54,826
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!

1651
01:56:54,871 --> 01:56:57,172
Yes! The power of breathing!

1652
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:00,243
In, out!

1653
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:04,055
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

1654
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:07,712
<i>They’re two sides of the same coin,
this breathing and the Stone Mask</i>

1655
01:57:07,746 --> 01:57:09,952
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

1656
01:57:09,975 --> 01:57:10,383
Dio!

1657
01:57:10,389 --> 01:57:11,023
Yes!

1658
01:57:11,215 --> 01:57:14,782
<i>The mask is not broken—he has it!</i>

1659
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:19,357
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

1660
01:57:19,499 --> 01:57:23,386
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

1661
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:25,822
<i>Pursuing the mask</i>

1662
01:57:25,885 --> 01:57:27,954
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

1663
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,564
Dio is alive?!

1664
01:57:29,675 --> 01:57:30,675
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1665
01:57:30,047 --> 01:57:32,063
<i>We must fight!</i>

1666
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,614
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1667
01:57:32,581 --> 01:57:34,065
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

1668
01:57:33,793 --> 01:57:35,103
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1669
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:39,114
<i>And you must wield this
ripple energy, or you will die! </i>

1670
01:57:39,193 --> 01:57:41,856
<i>That’s right, your fate,
and the fate of the world</i>

1671
01:57:40,808 --> 01:57:42,371
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1672
01:57:41,926 --> 01:57:43,839
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

1673
01:57:43,167 --> 01:57:44,268
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1674
01:57:44,166 --> 01:57:46,215
<i>I finally found it!</i>

1675
01:57:48,874 --> 01:57:53,087
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

1676
01:57:53,137 --> 01:57:57,341
<i>Are all tied together. This is—</i>

1677
01:57:58,907 --> 01:58:00,318
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1678
01:58:01,242 --> 01:58:02,642
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1679
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:04,881
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1680
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,963
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1681
01:58:08,294 --> 01:58:14,980
<i>Destiny!</i>

1682
01:58:20,226 --> 01:58:24,445
To fight... That is my destiny!

1683
01:58:26,029 --> 01:58:27,264
Mine and Dio’s!

1684
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:32,783
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

1685
01:58:32,816 --> 01:58:34,654
That turns humans into vampires.

1686
01:58:34,689 --> 01:58:38,693
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

1687
01:58:38,946 --> 01:58:44,655
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

1688
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:47,031
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

1689
01:58:49,419 --> 01:58:51,393
Ah, let’s put it this way.

1690
01:58:54,735 --> 01:58:58,136
What must you do to stop that ripple?

1691
01:59:00,572 --> 01:59:02,028
I think I’ve got it!

1692
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:08,273
Use a ripple!

1693
01:59:08,303 --> 01:59:12,180
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

1694
01:59:12,244 --> 01:59:15,184
And that wave of energy

1695
01:59:15,297 --> 01:59:18,860
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

1696
01:59:18,887 --> 01:59:19,708
You see?

1697
01:59:19,721 --> 01:59:20,990
The power to defeat Dio!

1698
01:59:21,032 --> 01:59:23,389
We’re already out of time.

1699
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:28,649
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

1700
01:59:30,215 --> 01:59:31,215
JoJo?

1701
01:59:32,312 --> 01:59:33,412
What do you mean, Dio?

1702
01:59:34,951 --> 01:59:35,951
Erina...

1703
01:59:38,423 --> 01:59:40,450
I can’t get you involved in this!

1704
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:43,326
For now, please just go along with it!

1705
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:45,500
I swear I’ll come back here again.

1706
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:47,584
How...?

1707
01:59:50,616 --> 01:59:53,092
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

1708
02:00:18,913 --> 02:00:26,613
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>

1709
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:30,762
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>

1710
02:00:32,804 --> 02:00:40,688
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

1711
02:00:42,082 --> 02:00:44,465
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>

1712
02:00:46,425 --> 02:00:51,371
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1713
02:00:51,489 --> 02:00:58,869
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1714
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:12,793
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>

1715
02:01:13,255 --> 02:01:15,588
<i>I am left behind</i>

1716
02:01:21,249 --> 02:01:27,440
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

1717
02:01:27,698 --> 02:01:32,785
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

1718
02:01:34,985 --> 02:01:41,571
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

1719
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:43,570
<i>I want to scream!</i>

1720
02:01:44,795 --> 02:01:47,258
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

1721
02:01:48,798 --> 02:01:53,646
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

1722
02:01:53,802 --> 02:02:01,747
<i>Forever guided by fate</i>

1723
02:02:02,284 --> 02:02:09,212
<i>I’ll live my days, spinning its thread</i>

1724
02:02:09,466 --> 02:02:13,802
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>

1725
02:02:14,939 --> 02:02:17,288
<i>Waiting right here</i>

1726
02:02:23,329 --> 02:02:27,575
<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>

1727
02:02:27,637 --> 02:02:34,182
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>

1728
02:02:36,862 --> 02:02:40,577
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>

1729
02:02:40,624 --> 02:02:45,100
<i>So that I can call this
destiny one of love</i>

1730
02:02:45,406 --> 02:02:50,030
<i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>

1731
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:51,100
JoJo!

1732
02:02:51,132 --> 02:02:55,895
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1733
02:02:56,237 --> 02:03:03,905
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1734
02:03:04,303 --> 02:03:09,041
<i>Our stars shine together</i>

1735
02:03:09,254 --> 02:03:16,212
<i>No matter where you are, I will, I will,</i>

1736
02:03:16,394 --> 02:03:20,067
<i>I will live on!</i>

1737
02:03:23,075 --> 02:03:27,449
<i>I will live on!</i>

1738
02:03:31,055 --> 02:03:39,678
<i>I will live on!</i>

1739
02:03:52,782 --> 02:03:55,679
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

1740
02:03:55,749 --> 02:03:56,749
Yep!

1741
02:04:06,451 --> 02:04:07,451
C’mere!

1742
02:04:17,783 --> 02:04:19,600
Why are you so strong?!

1743
02:04:19,908 --> 02:04:22,614
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!

1744
02:04:22,682 --> 02:04:27,462
Speeeedwagon!

1745
02:04:29,563 --> 02:04:34,499
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

1746
02:04:34,535 --> 02:04:35,718
JOJO: Stop right there!

1747
02:04:36,853 --> 02:04:37,853
Mr. Joestar!

1748
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:42,812
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

1749
02:04:42,862 --> 02:04:48,252
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

1750
02:04:48,295 --> 02:04:50,084
Licky licky? Licky licky!

1751
02:04:50,104 --> 02:04:51,810
Licky licky! Licky licky!

1752
02:04:51,828 --> 02:04:53,035
Lickithan Joestar.

1753
02:04:53,052 --> 02:04:54,884
JoJo, be careful.

1754
02:04:54,905 --> 02:04:56,500
He’s strong enough to rival you.

1755
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,145
What was that, you old fart?

1756
02:04:58,184 --> 02:04:59,017
<i>Old fart?</i>

1757
02:04:59,055 --> 02:05:00,642
Time for a taste!

1758
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:18,005
His arm... got longer!

1759
02:05:38,708 --> 02:05:39,808
It’s useless.

1760
02:05:41,287 --> 02:05:45,570
I’ve been given new life!

1761
02:05:46,829 --> 02:05:49,916
And a body that transcends humanit—

1762
02:05:49,949 --> 02:05:52,467
That’s not what’s important here.

1763
02:05:57,926 --> 02:05:59,661
M-My body...

1764
02:06:01,293 --> 02:06:02,356
It’s hot!

1765
02:06:02,380 --> 02:06:05,214
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!

1766
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:06,816
Ah! Wait!

1767
02:06:12,398 --> 02:06:13,610
It’s amazing!

1768
02:06:14,004 --> 02:06:17,439
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.

1769
02:06:20,091 --> 02:06:22,140
What’s wrong, JoJo?

1770
02:06:24,296 --> 02:06:27,533
I lost so much...

1771
02:06:29,025 --> 02:06:31,015
That’s why I wanted power.

1772
02:06:32,450 --> 02:06:35,704
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

1773
02:06:35,758 --> 02:06:40,418
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!

1774
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:42,046
But it’s the same power!

1775
02:06:43,174 --> 02:06:46,099
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:

1776
02:06:47,542 --> 02:06:50,956
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”

1777
02:06:52,025 --> 02:06:55,949
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

1778
02:06:55,986 --> 02:06:58,377
They became vikings with backbone!

1779
02:06:59,028 --> 02:07:00,889
You are different from Dio and his ilk!

1780
02:07:01,863 --> 02:07:03,662
Because you feel the pain.

1781
02:07:04,621 --> 02:07:05,721
Pain...

1782
02:07:07,478 --> 02:07:11,057
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>

1783
02:07:11,524 --> 02:07:15,206
<i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>

1784
02:07:15,325 --> 02:07:18,515
<i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>

1785
02:07:18,558 --> 02:07:22,709
<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

1786
02:07:22,745 --> 02:07:24,845
You need to listen to that pain!

1787
02:07:27,805 --> 02:07:33,574
<i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>

1788
02:07:35,309 --> 02:07:39,691
<i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>

1789
02:07:42,713 --> 02:07:49,734
<i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>

1790
02:07:50,682 --> 02:07:59,780
<i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>

1791
02:08:00,147 --> 02:08:04,234
<i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>

1792
02:08:04,386 --> 02:08:07,624
<i>Staining the darkness red</i>

1793
02:08:08,226 --> 02:08:11,797
<i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>

1794
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:15,509
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1795
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:18,292
It was pure coincidence!

1796
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:21,049
I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

1797
02:08:21,082 --> 02:08:22,182
What was that?!

1798
02:08:23,922 --> 02:08:30,769
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>

1799
02:08:31,138 --> 02:08:38,283
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>

1800
02:08:38,384 --> 02:08:41,424
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>

1801
02:08:42,083 --> 02:08:45,275
<i>The mask burst with light</i>

1802
02:08:45,814 --> 02:08:52,988
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>

1803
02:08:53,165 --> 02:08:54,373
Mr. Zeppeli!

1804
02:08:54,747 --> 02:08:57,564
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>

1805
02:08:57,647 --> 02:09:01,995
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>

1806
02:09:02,054 --> 02:09:07,848
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>

1807
02:09:07,908 --> 02:09:09,842
It was my father!

1808
02:09:10,818 --> 02:09:16,590
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>

1809
02:09:17,781 --> 02:09:22,737
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>

1810
02:09:23,121 --> 02:09:29,983
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1811
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:33,732
<i>ZEP: I’ve been chasing after it
JOJO: So that it won’t repeat</i>

1812
02:09:33,772 --> 02:09:37,193
<i>ZEP: I swore to take revenge
JOJO: I won’t let you down!</i>

1813
02:09:37,227 --> 02:09:39,686
<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be
JOJO: Shining bright</i>

1814
02:09:39,743 --> 02:09:47,194
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>

1815
02:09:48,090 --> 02:09:53,418
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!

1816
02:09:54,882 --> 02:09:57,585
And the resolve to face the consequences.

1817
02:10:01,638 --> 02:10:03,194
JoJo!

1818
02:10:07,521 --> 02:10:08,621
Hey JoJo.

1819
02:10:10,318 --> 02:10:11,836
JoJo JoJo JoJo.

1820
02:10:12,733 --> 02:10:14,164
Ha-hey JoJo.

1821
02:10:15,345 --> 02:10:17,496
Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.

1822
02:10:19,390 --> 02:10:22,596
Don’t forget this goal.

1823
02:10:23,895 --> 02:10:24,895
Yes, sir.

1824
02:10:25,970 --> 02:10:28,772
I believe in the power of the ripple.

1825
02:10:28,862 --> 02:10:29,862
Yep.

1826
02:10:30,119 --> 02:10:31,582
I like your fringe.

1827
02:10:32,757 --> 02:10:33,757
JoJo!

1828
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,429
Hey JoJo, JoJo!

1829
02:10:59,864 --> 02:11:02,225
Why, why?!

1830
02:11:07,553 --> 02:11:11,315
Jonathan Joestar!

1831
02:11:12,961 --> 02:11:16,519
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

1832
02:11:17,603 --> 02:11:19,073
Are you angry?

1833
02:11:20,051 --> 02:11:21,795
You’re good company, huh?

1834
02:11:21,819 --> 02:11:24,009
Oh! It burns! It burns!

1835
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:25,715
My body, it—

1836
02:11:27,729 --> 02:11:29,023
Is that Mr. Horse?

1837
02:11:29,052 --> 02:11:32,548
Look Wang Chan!
Your, your ancestors—

1838
02:11:32,578 --> 02:11:34,036
Clippity clop, clippity clop!

1839
02:11:35,407 --> 02:11:37,682
There he is.

1840
02:11:38,872 --> 02:11:42,700
<i>The lovable sweetheart, Mr. Joestar,
has finally got a handle on the ripple</i>

1841
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:44,961
<i>Hey yo yo! We’re coming
to collect payment</i>

1842
02:11:45,009 --> 02:11:46,874
<i>These bills been piling piling up</i>

1843
02:11:46,932 --> 02:11:50,765
<i>Your underworld rep, AKA
Speedwagon, is here to give a full report</i>

1844
02:11:50,826 --> 02:11:53,190
<i>Who else would be your guide</i>

1845
02:11:53,247 --> 02:11:56,436
<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>

1846
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:58,299
<i>South of London, in total daylight,</i>

1847
02:11:58,343 --> 02:11:59,879
<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

1848
02:11:59,925 --> 02:12:02,404
<i>When we pass through this
tunnel, you’ll see the sights</i>

1849
02:12:02,454 --> 02:12:04,179
<i>That famous city of knights</i>

1850
02:12:04,201 --> 02:12:06,300
<i>This is Windknight’s Lot</i>

1851
02:12:06,347 --> 02:12:08,243
<i>A natural fortress like an augite rock</i>

1852
02:12:08,291 --> 02:12:10,179
<i>Windknight’s Lot</i>

1853
02:12:10,223 --> 02:12:11,871
<i>Fate’ll have it—Dio’s hideout</i>

1854
02:12:11,926 --> 02:12:13,831
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1855
02:12:13,878 --> 02:12:15,774
<i>We’ll knock it out</i>

1856
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:17,685
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1857
02:12:17,747 --> 02:12:19,659
<i>Clean this vampire nest out</i>

1858
02:12:19,709 --> 02:12:22,050
<i>Ay, Dio, dick, you make me sick</i>

1859
02:12:22,099 --> 02:12:24,011
<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>

1860
02:12:24,058 --> 02:12:25,997
<i>No more tomorrows Dio, that’s it</i>

1861
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:28,060
<i>Now’s the end, ya gonna get hit!</i>

1862
02:12:29,730 --> 02:12:31,880
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.

1863
02:12:31,913 --> 02:12:35,540
My underground sources say that
Wang Chan definitely fled here.

1864
02:12:35,579 --> 02:12:38,500
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

1865
02:12:38,547 --> 02:12:40,999
It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.

1866
02:12:41,028 --> 02:12:43,485
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

1867
02:12:43,532 --> 02:12:45,446
Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.

1868
02:12:48,106 --> 02:12:50,550
Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?

1869
02:12:52,606 --> 02:12:54,324
Whaaat?!

1870
02:12:54,474 --> 02:12:57,224
Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.

1871
02:13:01,925 --> 02:13:03,655
L-Look!

1872
02:13:03,676 --> 02:13:05,630
T-The horse!!

1873
02:13:14,735 --> 02:13:16,466
What is he...

1874
02:13:18,511 --> 02:13:20,487
He’s inside the horse’s body!

1875
02:13:24,033 --> 02:13:28,428
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!

1876
02:13:38,064 --> 02:13:38,713
Mr. Joestar!

1877
02:13:38,726 --> 02:13:40,156
Stand down, you two.

1878
02:13:40,196 --> 02:13:41,715
I will fight!

1879
02:13:54,981 --> 02:13:56,884
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!

1880
02:13:56,904 --> 02:13:58,388
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

1881
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:01,237
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

1882
02:14:01,274 --> 02:14:03,345
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

1883
02:14:03,371 --> 02:14:05,754
What are you yammering on about!

1884
02:14:05,932 --> 02:14:08,021
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

1885
02:14:08,048 --> 02:14:09,770
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

1886
02:14:09,795 --> 02:14:12,390
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

1887
02:14:12,419 --> 02:14:14,709
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!

1888
02:14:14,743 --> 02:14:16,988
The hymn of humanity
is a song of courage!

1889
02:14:17,768 --> 02:14:21,299
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

1890
02:14:22,324 --> 02:14:25,833
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

1891
02:14:25,949 --> 02:14:27,624
They’re just like fleas!

1892
02:14:29,664 --> 02:14:33,148
Hot, so hot!

1893
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:36,626
How dare you! I’ll kill you!

1894
02:14:36,973 --> 02:14:41,309
Yes... I’ll eat every
shred of you in one bite!

1895
02:14:47,005 --> 02:14:48,767
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!

1896
02:14:48,787 --> 02:14:50,303
Windknight’s Lot...

1897
02:14:50,333 --> 02:14:53,754
I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.

1898
02:14:53,794 --> 02:14:56,397
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

1899
02:14:56,440 --> 02:14:59,838
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

1900
02:14:59,877 --> 02:15:02,953
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

1901
02:15:26,889 --> 02:15:28,766
Can you hear me?

1902
02:15:29,517 --> 02:15:32,453
Sleeping knights...

1903
02:15:46,894 --> 02:15:51,539
<i>Follow me, serve royalty once again</i>

1904
02:15:51,623 --> 02:15:55,955
<i>Get your revenge on the past,
let’s rewrite history</i>

1905
02:15:56,169 --> 02:16:00,875
<i>Upend righteousness,
go for total victory</i>

1906
02:16:01,149 --> 02:16:06,430
<i>That’s this world, the
unwavering world of Dio</i>

1907
02:16:09,447 --> 02:16:11,678
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1908
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:19,471
<i>Your long silence has
left this world to rot</i>

1909
02:16:19,676 --> 02:16:24,222
<i>Now raise your voices,
from crushed throats</i>

1910
02:16:24,299 --> 02:16:28,745
<i>Crying out from the mud,
conquer the stars</i>

1911
02:16:28,786 --> 02:16:31,437
<i>I’ll allow you this and more!</i>

1912
02:16:31,465 --> 02:16:33,489
<i>(My sword, it’s yours!)</i>

1913
02:16:34,354 --> 02:16:38,138
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices)</i>

1914
02:16:34,968 --> 02:16:38,438
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1915
02:16:38,190 --> 02:16:43,189
<i>(We’ve been sleeping for 300 years,
us rotten and forgotten corpses)</i>

1916
02:16:39,928 --> 02:16:43,150
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1917
02:16:43,687 --> 02:16:46,893
<i>Get your revenge!</i>

1918
02:16:47,243 --> 02:16:53,560
<i>300 years asleep, haunted
by painful thoughts</i>

1919
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:54,546
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1920
02:16:54,757 --> 02:16:57,010
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1921
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:59,272
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1922
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:01,638
Wait, Dio!

1923
02:17:01,782 --> 02:17:03,996
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1924
02:17:04,119 --> 02:17:06,360
Come quick, JoJo.

1925
02:17:06,487 --> 02:17:08,622
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1926
02:17:08,753 --> 02:17:12,744
My world is in the palm of my hand now!

1927
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:13,012
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1928
02:17:15,748 --> 02:17:18,072
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1929
02:17:18,099 --> 02:17:20,442
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1930
02:17:20,701 --> 02:17:24,309
<i>I will dominate life at last,</i>

1931
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:29,970
<i>Tearing its natural
order from God’s grasp</i>

1932
02:17:30,336 --> 02:17:33,693
<i>I will dominate history too,</i>

1933
02:17:33,857 --> 02:17:39,352
<i>Rewriting and upending it anew</i>

1934
02:17:39,722 --> 02:17:42,889
<i>I will dominate even time,</i>

1935
02:17:42,930 --> 02:17:46,809
<i>My body eternal and sublime</i>

1936
02:17:45,787 --> 02:17:48,652
{\an8}<i>(Eternal life!)</i>

1937
02:17:49,067 --> 02:17:56,901
<i>I will dominate everything,
rise above all my cares</i>

1938
02:17:55,205 --> 02:17:58,007
{\an8}<i>(We vow to steal them away!)</i>

1939
02:17:58,178 --> 02:18:02,639
<i>Win it all, negate righteousness</i>

1940
02:18:02,687 --> 02:18:06,500
<i>In this peacefully unaware country</i>

1941
02:18:04,347 --> 02:18:07,539
{\an8}<i>(This country is ours!)</i>

1942
02:18:07,742 --> 02:18:13,511
<i>I will dominate everything,
I’ll face them now</i>

1943
02:18:13,576 --> 02:18:16,899
<i>And demand peace of mind!</i>

1944
02:18:16,443 --> 02:18:18,559
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1945
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:22,854
<i>My world, this world!</i>

1946
02:18:18,817 --> 02:18:20,955
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1947
02:18:23,428 --> 02:18:24,571
<i>Wry wry!</i>

1948
02:18:24,606 --> 02:18:29,446
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1949
02:18:37,941 --> 02:18:40,261
It’s melting...

1950
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:42,726
It’s really melting away...

1951
02:18:42,752 --> 02:18:44,988
So much that there’s a hole in my cheek...

1952
02:18:45,237 --> 02:18:47,116
My tongue is sticking out of the hole!

1953
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:49,165
Your cheek is melting,

1954
02:18:50,973 --> 02:18:53,607
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?

1955
02:18:53,627 --> 02:18:54,341
Dio!

1956
02:18:54,351 --> 02:18:55,351
Oh, it really is.

1957
02:18:59,005 --> 02:19:01,055
The sun has set.

1958
02:19:02,448 --> 02:19:06,948
It’s time for your lives
to go down with it!

1959
02:19:07,311 --> 02:19:10,400
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!

1960
02:19:10,533 --> 02:19:12,603
Even so, I can’t help
this feeling of dread.

1961
02:19:12,627 --> 02:19:14,698
As a human, I can’t let
you get away with this!

1962
02:19:14,725 --> 02:19:15,725
JoJo!

1963
02:19:16,793 --> 02:19:18,499
Put your training to use.

1964
02:19:30,221 --> 02:19:33,425
<i>(We’ll feast! On your blood and flesh!)</i>

1965
02:19:34,306 --> 02:19:36,070
<i>(Steal it away!)</i>

1966
02:19:37,052 --> 02:19:39,713
<i>(To heal all of our wounds!)</i>

1967
02:19:39,771 --> 02:19:42,735
<i>JoJo, here’s a lesson for you</i>

1968
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:49,405
<i>The north wind made the vikings!</i>

1969
02:19:49,525 --> 02:19:50,930
This battle will be an exercise—

1970
02:19:50,955 --> 02:19:53,981
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!

1971
02:19:54,038 --> 02:19:56,957
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!

1972
02:19:57,017 --> 02:19:58,982
The north wind made the vikings!

1973
02:19:59,918 --> 02:20:02,859
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—

1974
02:20:08,274 --> 02:20:12,710
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>

1975
02:20:13,014 --> 02:20:16,820
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>

1976
02:20:16,468 --> 02:20:17,609
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1977
02:20:17,706 --> 02:20:22,238
<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>

1978
02:20:22,315 --> 02:20:26,689
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1979
02:20:26,947 --> 02:20:30,788
<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>

1980
02:20:31,192 --> 02:20:35,529
<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>

1981
02:20:35,769 --> 02:20:41,540
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

1982
02:20:42,057 --> 02:20:44,369
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1983
02:20:48,222 --> 02:20:49,278
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>

1984
02:20:48,445 --> 02:20:50,720
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>

1985
02:20:49,749 --> 02:20:51,164
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1986
02:20:50,783 --> 02:20:52,800
<i>The ripple of the wine!</i>

1987
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:53,942
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1988
02:20:53,459 --> 02:20:57,661
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my
way through the darkness!</i>

1989
02:20:57,788 --> 02:21:00,128
<i>The waves of the ripple!</i>

1990
02:20:59,237 --> 02:21:00,565
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1991
02:21:00,264 --> 02:21:02,416
<i>Are resounding through my body!</i>

1992
02:21:01,528 --> 02:21:02,766
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1993
02:21:02,568 --> 02:21:04,560
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>

1994
02:21:04,588 --> 02:21:07,371
<i>Find your way through the darkness!</i>

1995
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:10,893
<i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>

1996
02:21:11,402 --> 02:21:17,314
<i>Pa-pow-pow-pow with unrelenting heat!</i>

1997
02:21:15,472 --> 02:21:16,472
{\an8}<i>(Heat!)</i>

1998
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:18,516
<i>Sunlight...</i>

1999
02:21:18,554 --> 02:21:19,687
<i>(Sunlight...)</i>

2000
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:20,889
<i>Yellow...</i>

2001
02:21:20,927 --> 02:21:22,115
<i>(Yellow...)</i>

2002
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:23,151
<i>Over...</i>

2003
02:21:23,185 --> 02:21:23,824
<i>(Over!)</i>

2004
02:21:23,862 --> 02:21:25,495
<i>Sunlight yellow, sunlight yellow</i>

2005
02:21:25,556 --> 02:21:34,259
<i>Overdrive!!</i>

2006
02:21:40,767 --> 02:21:43,241
The ripple of the sun! Dio!

2007
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:45,778
This is the power
that will defeat you!

2008
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:51,019
Dio Brando?

2009
02:21:51,067 --> 02:21:52,067
Yeah?

2010
02:21:52,476 --> 02:21:54,745
I don’t know you, but...

2011
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:00,911
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:

2012
02:22:02,219 --> 02:22:04,236
Finally, we meet.

2013
02:22:04,583 --> 02:22:06,499
Don’t get carried away!

2014
02:22:11,812 --> 02:22:16,956
Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.

2015
02:22:19,693 --> 02:22:22,325
You’re the one who put it there!

2016
02:22:23,028 --> 02:22:27,647
Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.

2017
02:22:29,278 --> 02:22:31,738
I’ll be using your lives...

2018
02:22:32,221 --> 02:22:35,513
To purge this wound!

2019
02:22:35,540 --> 02:22:36,825
You bastard!

2020
02:22:36,857 --> 02:22:40,831
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?

2021
02:22:47,555 --> 02:22:56,219
Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?

2022
02:23:02,207 --> 02:23:04,723
I’ll make you submit!

2023
02:23:06,393 --> 02:23:08,172
By the ripple of the sun!

2024
02:23:09,357 --> 02:23:10,567
Pow!

2025
02:23:10,965 --> 02:23:14,251
Utterly pathetic!

2026
02:23:14,298 --> 02:23:16,075
It’s freezing?!

2027
02:23:16,207 --> 02:23:20,902
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!

2028
02:23:20,956 --> 02:23:25,641
I am able to control my own body at will.

2029
02:23:26,795 --> 02:23:29,529
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2030
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:32,767
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2031
02:23:33,504 --> 02:23:35,647
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2032
02:23:36,284 --> 02:23:37,503
Mr. Zeppeli!

2033
02:23:39,969 --> 02:23:42,758
Useless, useless, useless, useless!

2034
02:23:44,532 --> 02:23:48,087
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2035
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:52,056
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,

2036
02:23:52,101 --> 02:23:57,326
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2037
02:24:04,018 --> 02:24:08,359
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.

2038
02:24:08,396 --> 02:24:10,305
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...

2039
02:24:11,687 --> 02:24:15,053
That’s right. Do you remember?

2040
02:24:15,487 --> 02:24:19,836
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?

2041
02:24:19,892 --> 02:24:20,895
What?

2042
02:24:20,969 --> 02:24:26,152
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2043
02:24:26,315 --> 02:24:30,243
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2044
02:24:30,770 --> 02:24:32,921
Mary Stuart!

2045
02:24:34,146 --> 02:24:35,986
It was about the ones who served her!

2046
02:24:36,699 --> 02:24:41,248
The story of those two proud knights...

2047
02:24:41,858 --> 02:24:42,835
Father told us...

2048
02:24:42,870 --> 02:24:43,870
Yes!

2049
02:24:44,214 --> 02:24:47,898
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

2050
02:24:49,345 --> 02:24:51,557
JoJo, Dio!

2051
02:24:51,644 --> 02:24:54,313
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,

2052
02:24:54,370 --> 02:24:57,016
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2053
02:24:57,818 --> 02:25:00,986
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—

2054
02:25:01,023 --> 02:25:04,104
This is a story of knightly pride!

2055
02:25:06,083 --> 02:25:10,502
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

2056
02:25:10,732 --> 02:25:15,077
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2057
02:25:15,281 --> 02:25:19,667
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>

2058
02:25:19,836 --> 02:25:23,953
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2059
02:25:24,341 --> 02:25:28,443
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>

2060
02:25:28,928 --> 02:25:32,412
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>

2061
02:25:33,562 --> 02:25:41,659
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2062
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:50,852
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>

2063
02:25:51,714 --> 02:25:56,262
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>

2064
02:25:56,313 --> 02:26:00,432
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2065
02:26:00,778 --> 02:26:05,295
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>

2066
02:26:05,346 --> 02:26:09,596
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2067
02:26:10,093 --> 02:26:14,012
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,

2068
02:26:14,060 --> 02:26:18,222
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2069
02:26:19,243 --> 02:26:23,236
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

2070
02:26:23,545 --> 02:26:27,690
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>

2071
02:26:28,093 --> 02:26:32,523
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>

2072
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:37,007
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2073
02:26:37,105 --> 02:26:41,440
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2074
02:26:41,659 --> 02:26:46,159
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2075
02:26:46,234 --> 02:26:54,555
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2076
02:26:54,672 --> 02:26:59,451
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2077
02:26:59,534 --> 02:27:04,713
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2078
02:27:05,102 --> 02:27:07,235
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2079
02:27:07,286 --> 02:27:09,698
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!

2080
02:27:09,726 --> 02:27:12,216
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2081
02:27:12,301 --> 02:27:14,572
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2082
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:17,930
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2083
02:27:18,017 --> 02:27:22,563
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2084
02:27:27,263 --> 02:27:30,958
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2085
02:27:31,033 --> 02:27:35,909
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2086
02:27:36,414 --> 02:27:40,849
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2087
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:45,400
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>

2088
02:27:45,486 --> 02:27:49,590
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2089
02:27:49,667 --> 02:27:54,502
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2090
02:27:54,590 --> 02:27:57,949
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2091
02:27:58,005 --> 02:28:00,068
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2092
02:28:00,123 --> 02:28:07,519
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2093
02:28:09,933 --> 02:28:17,235
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2094
02:28:17,608 --> 02:28:19,301
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!

2095
02:28:19,345 --> 02:28:20,955
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2096
02:28:21,003 --> 02:28:23,550
But those two should
have done a better job!

2097
02:28:23,604 --> 02:28:26,040
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2098
02:28:26,067 --> 02:28:28,178
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2099
02:28:28,229 --> 02:28:30,589
It might be as you say, however—

2100
02:28:30,639 --> 02:28:32,673
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2101
02:28:32,728 --> 02:28:35,832
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2102
02:28:36,091 --> 02:28:37,541
Everything is connected!

2103
02:28:37,571 --> 02:28:41,304
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2104
02:28:42,991 --> 02:28:47,469
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2105
02:28:47,546 --> 02:28:51,947
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2106
02:28:52,025 --> 02:28:56,683
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2107
02:28:56,781 --> 02:29:03,657
<i>Either one—</i>

2108
02:29:04,538 --> 02:29:05,638
<i>JoJo</i>

2109
02:29:06,686 --> 02:29:07,786
<i>Dio</i>

2110
02:29:08,654 --> 02:29:15,042
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2111
02:29:23,513 --> 02:29:25,599
I turned those two

2112
02:29:25,876 --> 02:29:31,317
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!

2113
02:29:32,237 --> 02:29:37,793
Even history bends before me!

2114
02:29:37,832 --> 02:29:39,032
It can’t be!

2115
02:29:47,594 --> 02:29:49,792
Such grotesque forms!

2116
02:29:49,832 --> 02:29:54,410
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2117
02:29:55,069 --> 02:29:57,293
Don’t you think so?

2118
02:29:58,351 --> 02:30:00,971
Kill them all!

2119
02:30:01,232 --> 02:30:03,470
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2120
02:30:03,522 --> 02:30:04,607
Tarkus!

2121
02:30:04,619 --> 02:30:05,642
Bruford!

2122
02:30:06,182 --> 02:30:09,471
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2123
02:30:09,864 --> 02:30:12,523
Our grudge!

2124
02:30:12,552 --> 02:30:14,829
Our pride!

2125
02:30:14,854 --> 02:30:16,736
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2126
02:30:17,083 --> 02:30:18,193
And you, Tarkus!

2127
02:30:18,959 --> 02:30:20,418
The way you feel—

2128
02:30:20,911 --> 02:30:23,111
Your pride, your resentment.

2129
02:30:25,269 --> 02:30:27,042
I can’t even imagine it!

2130
02:30:28,023 --> 02:30:31,214
But I also bear my own burdens!

2131
02:30:31,303 --> 02:30:34,383
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2132
02:30:34,676 --> 02:30:37,926
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2133
02:30:41,531 --> 02:30:43,809
That man’s pride...

2134
02:30:43,836 --> 02:30:45,967
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2135
02:30:46,253 --> 02:30:48,867
My master—I, Bruford,

2136
02:30:49,104 --> 02:30:53,346
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2137
02:30:53,383 --> 02:30:55,518
Alright, go ahead!

2138
02:30:57,907 --> 02:30:59,463
We’ll duel as knights!

2139
02:31:03,166 --> 02:31:04,092
Run away, you two!

2140
02:31:04,102 --> 02:31:04,739
Mr. Joestar!

2141
02:31:04,772 --> 02:31:05,772
Tarkus!

2142
02:31:07,836 --> 02:31:11,106
I won’t let you interfere!

2143
02:31:25,134 --> 02:31:32,549
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2144
02:31:32,905 --> 02:31:40,375
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2145
02:31:42,821 --> 02:31:43,708
Old man!

2146
02:31:43,724 --> 02:31:45,382
Don’t come any closer!

2147
02:31:51,539 --> 02:31:52,539
Damn it...

2148
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:55,839
Fucking hell!

2149
02:31:57,328 --> 02:32:01,423
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2150
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:05,207
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2151
02:32:05,476 --> 02:32:09,214
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2152
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:13,454
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2153
02:32:13,581 --> 02:32:16,488
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2154
02:32:16,854 --> 02:32:21,944
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2155
02:32:24,090 --> 02:32:25,241
Honourable knight,

2156
02:32:25,814 --> 02:32:27,836
Is revenge your answer?

2157
02:32:28,309 --> 02:32:30,299
Is that what you take pride in?

2158
02:32:31,735 --> 02:32:35,296
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2159
02:32:35,482 --> 02:32:37,549
You can lecture me after you win!

2160
02:32:37,603 --> 02:32:40,722
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2161
02:32:40,765 --> 02:32:45,114
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2162
02:32:45,177 --> 02:32:48,915
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2163
02:32:48,954 --> 02:32:51,883
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

2164
02:32:51,978 --> 02:32:54,205
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2165
02:32:54,305 --> 02:32:55,638
Old man!

2166
02:33:01,445 --> 02:33:03,814
Melt!

2167
02:33:04,116 --> 02:33:07,345
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2168
02:33:07,597 --> 02:33:08,797
Speedwagon...

2169
02:33:09,865 --> 02:33:13,405
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2170
02:33:13,465 --> 02:33:17,450
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2171
02:33:17,996 --> 02:33:21,464
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2172
02:33:21,508 --> 02:33:25,377
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

2173
02:33:25,444 --> 02:33:33,134
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2174
02:33:33,706 --> 02:33:40,245
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2175
02:33:40,402 --> 02:33:41,402
JoJo!

2176
02:33:44,972 --> 02:33:48,028
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2177
02:33:55,635 --> 02:33:59,095
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2178
02:33:59,128 --> 02:34:01,192
Let it somehow be restored!

2179
02:34:01,785 --> 02:34:05,509
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2180
02:34:06,341 --> 02:34:09,728
This pain means nothing to me!

2181
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:17,849
Why aren’t you moving?

2182
02:34:21,208 --> 02:34:22,408
Just now,

2183
02:34:25,118 --> 02:34:26,638
You said “pain”.

2184
02:34:29,469 --> 02:34:30,719
That means that now,

2185
02:34:32,287 --> 02:34:33,874
You can feel pain!

2186
02:34:35,455 --> 02:34:36,518
Pain?

2187
02:34:39,831 --> 02:34:41,031
That’s why...

2188
02:34:43,109 --> 02:34:44,944
I stopped fighting you.

2189
02:34:48,199 --> 02:34:50,140
That’s why you stopped your sword.

2190
02:34:54,041 --> 02:34:55,913
You are a great knight.

2191
02:34:58,226 --> 02:34:59,526
You are human!

2192
02:35:02,752 --> 02:35:04,069
Pain...

2193
02:35:04,938 --> 02:35:06,714
Is proof of life!

2194
02:35:09,102 --> 02:35:11,751
So this is what it means to be human?

2195
02:35:12,797 --> 02:35:17,281
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

2196
02:35:27,978 --> 02:35:32,286
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

2197
02:35:34,031 --> 02:35:35,031
Bruford...

2198
02:35:38,034 --> 02:35:41,338
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

2199
02:35:43,290 --> 02:35:44,825
Luck!

2200
02:35:46,009 --> 02:35:47,222
And also...

2201
02:35:47,500 --> 02:35:49,714
Pluck!

2202
02:35:56,891 --> 02:36:01,682
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

2203
02:36:02,916 --> 02:36:05,442
Damn you!

2204
02:36:08,139 --> 02:36:13,358
JoJo!

2205
02:36:20,887 --> 02:36:25,983
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

2206
02:36:28,029 --> 02:36:30,051
Just as I thought...

2207
02:36:30,149 --> 02:36:32,236
I, Dio, will—

2208
02:36:36,028 --> 02:36:37,028
Hey baby!

2209
02:36:37,566 --> 02:36:40,955
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

2210
02:36:41,071 --> 02:36:42,535
What the...

2211
02:36:42,693 --> 02:36:49,097
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

2212
02:36:53,684 --> 02:36:55,000
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

2213
02:37:03,147 --> 02:37:05,766
What an embarrassment of a knight!

2214
02:37:06,465 --> 02:37:09,369
He never got his revenge!

2215
02:37:09,517 --> 02:37:12,492
What did he have to be joyful about!

2216
02:37:12,587 --> 02:37:13,587
JoJo!

2217
02:37:23,739 --> 02:37:24,903
No!

2218
02:37:25,406 --> 02:37:28,850
How could you!

2219
02:37:31,927 --> 02:37:33,677
For victory!

2220
02:37:36,885 --> 02:37:40,720
I take pride in victory!

2221
02:37:41,048 --> 02:37:42,787
Fuck!

2222
02:37:42,806 --> 02:37:44,250
I’ll get you!

2223
02:37:44,268 --> 02:37:45,734
I’ll get you for this!

2224
02:37:47,367 --> 02:37:48,367
JoJo...

2225
02:37:50,340 --> 02:37:51,340
JoJo!

2226
02:37:51,597 --> 02:37:53,740
My final ripple...

2227
02:37:54,500 --> 02:37:56,355
My... dying wish is...

2228
02:37:58,684 --> 02:38:02,581
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

2229
02:38:18,974 --> 02:38:20,663
He collapsed.

2230
02:38:31,221 --> 02:38:34,909
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

2231
02:38:36,293 --> 02:38:39,912
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

2232
02:38:47,162 --> 02:38:48,559
Old man!

2233
02:38:50,468 --> 02:38:51,468
Mr. Zeppeli!

2234
02:38:52,153 --> 02:38:53,439
If we lose you—

2235
02:38:53,458 --> 02:38:55,410
There’s no time to be sad.

2236
02:38:55,596 --> 02:38:58,058
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

2237
02:38:58,303 --> 02:38:59,517
Old man!

2238
02:38:59,953 --> 02:39:00,953
I...

2239
02:39:01,778 --> 02:39:04,704
I lived my own life to the fullest.

2240
02:39:05,592 --> 02:39:07,076
In the end,

2241
02:39:07,785 --> 02:39:10,781
I leave everything I have to you.

2242
02:39:12,189 --> 02:39:13,189
JoJo,

2243
02:39:13,578 --> 02:39:15,982
You are my hope.

2244
02:39:23,251 --> 02:39:32,951
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

2245
02:39:34,969 --> 02:39:41,745
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

2246
02:39:43,385 --> 02:39:45,384
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

2247
02:39:47,432 --> 02:39:57,253
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

2248
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:05,879
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

2249
02:40:06,450 --> 02:40:09,645
<i>Into my spirit</i>

2250
02:40:12,451 --> 02:40:13,737
It felt like...

2251
02:40:13,765 --> 02:40:17,272
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.

2252
02:40:17,814 --> 02:40:19,543
From here on...

2253
02:40:20,152 --> 02:40:22,175
I live within you.

2254
02:40:23,074 --> 02:40:24,226
JoJo.

2255
02:40:28,152 --> 02:40:33,293
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2256
02:40:34,086 --> 02:40:39,605
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

2257
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:45,649
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

2258
02:40:46,299 --> 02:40:49,274
<i>Even this pain...</i>

2259
02:40:52,304 --> 02:40:55,505
<i>Even this pain</i>

2260
02:40:58,381 --> 02:41:08,472
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

2261
02:41:10,463 --> 02:41:20,522
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

2262
02:41:21,482 --> 02:41:32,666
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

2263
02:41:33,847 --> 02:41:38,228
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

2264
02:41:39,297 --> 02:41:42,871
<i>And from this prison...</i>

2265
02:41:45,447 --> 02:41:47,915
<i>I see the stars</i>

2266
02:41:48,405 --> 02:41:54,232
<i>A golden spirit</i>

2267
02:41:54,499 --> 02:42:00,249
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

2268
02:42:00,927 --> 02:42:06,183
<i>Will light up</i>

2269
02:42:06,568 --> 02:42:10,748
<i>The way to you...</i>

2270
02:42:11,741 --> 02:42:12,675
Dio!

2271
02:42:12,759 --> 02:42:17,932
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

2272
02:42:47,253 --> 02:42:49,084
JoJo...!

2273
02:42:57,753 --> 02:43:01,146
<i>Dio...</i>

2274
02:43:01,862 --> 02:43:05,298
<i>Dio...</i>

2275
02:43:06,101 --> 02:43:10,026
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

2276
02:43:10,354 --> 02:43:14,334
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

2277
02:43:14,405 --> 02:43:18,357
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

2278
02:43:14,761 --> 02:43:18,395
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2279
02:43:18,881 --> 02:43:22,400
<i>I already killed my past</i>

2280
02:43:18,905 --> 02:43:22,444
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2281
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:26,701
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

2282
02:43:26,858 --> 02:43:31,418
<i>You and I are different</i>

2283
02:43:31,672 --> 02:43:35,537
<i>We’re not so different, you’re my son</i>

2284
02:43:35,584 --> 02:43:39,623
<i>I have changed into something new</i>

2285
02:43:39,694 --> 02:43:43,894
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

2286
02:43:44,005 --> 02:43:46,011
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

2287
02:43:46,035 --> 02:43:48,170
<i>DIO: I’ll steal it all
DARIO: You’ll steal it all</i>

2288
02:43:48,208 --> 02:43:52,474
<i>DIO: Upend righteousness</i>

2289
02:43:50,352 --> 02:43:53,902
<i>DARIO: You’re my clever boy!</i>

2290
02:43:52,546 --> 02:43:56,663
<i>DIO: I will conquer it all</i>

2291
02:43:54,608 --> 02:43:59,061
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

2292
02:43:57,792 --> 02:44:01,265
<i>DIO: I will dominate everything</i>

2293
02:44:01,314 --> 02:44:06,178
<i>Go ahead and dominate,
what will you want after that?</i>

2294
02:44:06,257 --> 02:44:10,724
<i>What do I want?</i>

2295
02:44:08,860 --> 02:44:13,373
<i>DARIO: What do you want?</i>

2296
02:44:10,765 --> 02:44:13,336
<i>DIO: What do I want?</i>

2297
02:44:13,425 --> 02:44:15,066
<i>I want...</i>

2298
02:44:15,151 --> 02:44:19,181
<i>I want...</i>

2299
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:25,196
{\an8}<i>Dio... Dio...</i>

2300
02:44:19,247 --> 02:44:26,628
<i>I want...</i>

2301
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:34,189
So you’ve come...

2302
02:44:36,334 --> 02:44:40,619
JoJo.

2303
02:44:41,252 --> 02:44:42,531
Is this...

2304
02:44:46,097 --> 02:44:48,122
The world you wished for?

2305
02:44:51,746 --> 02:44:52,746
What?

2306
02:44:56,890 --> 02:44:57,890
The world...

2307
02:45:01,565 --> 02:45:04,323
That you’ve been trying
to obtain for so long...

2308
02:45:09,224 --> 02:45:11,123
Surrounded by death...

2309
02:45:12,737 --> 02:45:14,118
It’s a pitiful world, isn’t it?

2310
02:45:18,424 --> 02:45:21,664
It’s a splendid world where
I’ve dominated everything.

2311
02:45:22,153 --> 02:45:25,438
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

2312
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:28,512
For that reason, you stole
from uninvolved innocents?

2313
02:45:32,402 --> 02:45:37,100
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

2314
02:45:40,393 --> 02:45:41,655
You’re just afraid.

2315
02:45:44,415 --> 02:45:45,462
Of being human...

2316
02:45:49,765 --> 02:45:51,506
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

2317
02:45:56,097 --> 02:45:57,605
For the sake of obtaining this world...

2318
02:45:58,989 --> 02:46:00,638
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

2319
02:46:00,687 --> 02:46:01,907
You ran away from it.

2320
02:46:12,773 --> 02:46:14,905
The ends justify the means.

2321
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:19,405
I will win,

2322
02:46:21,306 --> 02:46:24,548
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

2323
02:46:26,134 --> 02:46:28,796
All of this is fate!

2324
02:46:28,843 --> 02:46:29,993
No!

2325
02:46:31,445 --> 02:46:33,355
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

2326
02:46:35,076 --> 02:46:36,424
Opposing fate...

2327
02:46:38,281 --> 02:46:39,979
What will your legacy be?

2328
02:46:43,525 --> 02:46:45,460
Such righteousness!

2329
02:46:53,466 --> 02:46:57,051
Just like the one who gave me this power...

2330
02:46:58,802 --> 02:47:00,660
And then died!

2331
02:47:05,082 --> 02:47:06,701
Just like...

2332
02:47:08,790 --> 02:47:12,945
Your father.

2333
02:47:16,919 --> 02:47:19,267
That’s right.

2334
02:47:28,257 --> 02:47:30,237
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

2335
02:47:33,474 --> 02:47:35,335
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

2336
02:47:38,851 --> 02:47:40,339
For the sake of revenge...

2337
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:43,140
Dio...

2338
02:47:45,612 --> 02:47:47,314
I will kill you!

2339
02:47:47,565 --> 02:47:51,481
We’re one and the same; you want
to exact your revenge! I admire that!

2340
02:47:51,542 --> 02:47:53,846
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

2341
02:47:53,894 --> 02:47:55,738
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

2342
02:47:55,778 --> 02:47:56,481
Speedwagon!

2343
02:47:56,514 --> 02:47:57,227
Right!

2344
02:48:00,343 --> 02:48:06,574
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

2345
02:48:06,683 --> 02:48:09,716
<i>I’ll suck you dry</i>

2346
02:48:09,749 --> 02:48:12,229
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

2347
02:48:13,170 --> 02:48:19,222
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

2348
02:48:19,522 --> 02:48:25,266
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

2349
02:48:26,168 --> 02:48:27,919
<i>Useless, useless, useless, useless!</i>

2350
02:48:29,129 --> 02:48:32,040
<i>I obtained this power</i>

2351
02:48:32,309 --> 02:48:35,408
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

2352
02:48:35,490 --> 02:48:38,659
<i>So I could steal everything from you</i>

2353
02:48:38,735 --> 02:48:41,735
<i>I’ll dull this pain</i>

2354
02:48:41,901 --> 02:48:44,890
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

2355
02:48:44,968 --> 02:48:48,148
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

2356
02:48:48,234 --> 02:48:52,922
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

2357
02:48:52,987 --> 02:48:55,322
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

2358
02:48:59,421 --> 02:49:01,373
<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

2359
02:49:02,013 --> 02:49:03,560
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

2360
02:49:03,735 --> 02:49:06,007
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

2361
02:49:06,038 --> 02:49:09,058
You did it! You defeated Dio!

2362
02:49:09,107 --> 02:49:10,433
Not a chance!

2363
02:49:10,746 --> 02:49:12,277
You fools!

2364
02:49:13,813 --> 02:49:15,368
What! The sword is freezing—

2365
02:49:17,442 --> 02:49:20,543
Utterly pathetic!

2366
02:49:20,568 --> 02:49:21,804
Mr. Joestar!

2367
02:49:22,123 --> 02:49:23,920
JoJo!

2368
02:49:26,501 --> 02:49:32,514
<i>Utterly pathetic! I’m grasping
your carotid artery, JoJo!</i>

2369
02:49:32,787 --> 02:49:38,787
<i>With this, you’ll become
one of my undead servants</i>

2370
02:49:39,241 --> 02:49:40,973
<i>Ironic, isn’t it, Dio?</i>

2371
02:49:41,034 --> 02:49:45,539
<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

2372
02:49:45,715 --> 02:49:50,931
<i>Why don’t you freeze me now, Dio!</i>

2373
02:49:51,894 --> 02:49:53,791
My fist... Just from hitting him!

2374
02:49:53,856 --> 02:49:57,116
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

2375
02:49:58,510 --> 02:50:01,666
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

2376
02:50:01,726 --> 02:50:04,850
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

2377
02:50:04,954 --> 02:50:07,794
<i>DIO: Let’s test your willpower
JOJO: I will reach you!</i>

2378
02:50:07,853 --> 02:50:11,053
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

2379
02:50:11,115 --> 02:50:14,311
<i>JOJO: Us humans...
DIO: To be human is to have limits</i>

2380
02:50:14,373 --> 02:50:17,665
<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

2381
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:20,686
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2382
02:50:20,763 --> 02:50:26,863
<i>DIO: I’ll chip away at this body to prove it
JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

2383
02:50:28,667 --> 02:50:30,511
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

2384
02:50:30,564 --> 02:50:33,571
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2385
02:50:33,631 --> 02:50:36,671
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

2386
02:50:36,918 --> 02:50:39,946
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2387
02:50:40,007 --> 02:50:43,249
<i>JOJO: Our connection, it’s here
DIO: Even when I’ve thrown away my humanity</i>

2388
02:50:43,318 --> 02:50:46,225
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2389
02:50:46,311 --> 02:50:50,033
<i>With my life on the
line, I’ll prove it now!</i>

2390
02:50:50,103 --> 02:50:54,284
<i>-Dio! Dio! Dio!
-JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

2391
02:50:57,542 --> 02:50:59,636
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

2392
02:51:00,063 --> 02:51:02,046
“I like being number one!”

2393
02:51:05,036 --> 02:51:06,075
“My eye!”

2394
02:51:06,127 --> 02:51:08,376
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

2395
02:51:12,624 --> 02:51:13,624
Dio!

2396
02:51:15,246 --> 02:51:22,670
<i>I won’t stop beating you
until you’re finished!</i>

2397
02:51:29,846 --> 02:51:31,001
This is impossible!

2398
02:51:31,571 --> 02:51:33,804
The heat is coursing through me!

2399
02:51:34,303 --> 02:51:35,554
I’m melting!

2400
02:51:35,593 --> 02:51:36,878
Crumble to dust!

2401
02:51:36,923 --> 02:51:39,137
I can’t be...

2402
02:51:40,173 --> 02:51:42,236
Not yet!!

2403
02:51:45,324 --> 02:51:49,537
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

2404
02:51:49,608 --> 02:51:53,183
Lord Dio...!

2405
02:52:02,355 --> 02:52:03,355

<i>(Now, on to other news...)</i>

2432
02:53:40,447 --> 02:53:42,352
Mr. Joestar! Both of you!

2433
02:53:42,372 --> 02:53:43,911
Best of wishes!

2434
02:53:44,161 --> 02:53:46,120
I’ll always be there for you!

2435
02:53:46,185 --> 02:53:49,789
If you’re in trouble, I’ll rush anywhere!

2436
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:52,027
Happy honeymoon!

2437
02:53:52,056 --> 02:53:54,904
I can’t wait to hear all about it!

2438
02:53:55,549 --> 02:53:57,549
America, how nice!

2439
02:53:57,902 --> 02:54:00,116
I wanna go there too,

2440
02:54:00,145 --> 02:54:02,742
And try to dig up some oil for myself!

2441
02:54:03,203 --> 02:54:04,727
Damn it...

2442
02:54:05,918 --> 02:54:09,601
But after this, a fateful
moment was soon to come...

2443
02:54:10,112 --> 02:54:14,302
This story will be passed down
until the world has come full circle.

2444
02:54:14,355 --> 02:54:19,149
That will be the life’s work
of Speedwagon the meddler...

2445
02:54:19,516 --> 02:54:24,044
But, the one to tell you what
happens right now won’t be me...

2446
02:54:32,531 --> 02:54:37,341
<i>I pray that today will never end</i>

2447
02:54:37,387 --> 02:54:40,490
<i>In the midst of a carousel of stars</i>

2448
02:54:41,063 --> 02:54:49,438
<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>

2449
02:54:49,795 --> 02:54:51,097
What’s wrong?

2450
02:54:54,408 --> 02:54:56,361
When you’re next to me...

2451
02:54:57,169 --> 02:54:58,586
I’m happy!

2452
02:54:58,997 --> 02:55:00,632
I feel the same.

2453
02:55:01,023 --> 02:55:03,118
I wish you could’ve met my father...

2454
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:05,744
Well, let’s go and eat!

2455
02:55:10,721 --> 02:55:11,721
Jonathan?

2456
02:55:12,568 --> 02:55:13,568
That’s...

2457
02:55:17,567 --> 02:55:18,567
Erina,

2458
02:55:19,625 --> 02:55:21,062
Go back to our cabin.

2459
02:55:21,788 --> 02:55:23,735
Don’t forget to lock the door!

2460
02:55:34,352 --> 02:55:36,459
I have lured him here.

2461
02:55:37,127 --> 02:55:38,823
My body...

2462
02:55:40,234 --> 02:55:41,728
Have you come?

2463
02:55:43,064 --> 02:55:44,064
Dio...

2464
02:55:44,584 --> 02:55:45,584
JoJo...

2465
02:55:47,491 --> 02:55:51,838
I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

2466
02:55:53,517 --> 02:55:55,901
I used to despise you so much,

2467
02:55:56,171 --> 02:55:58,568
But now I respect you...

2468
02:55:59,181 --> 02:56:01,170
That’s because I’ve realised something!

2469
02:56:03,676 --> 02:56:06,932
If there is a God that controls fate,

2470
02:56:07,836 --> 02:56:11,620
Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

2471
02:56:13,138 --> 02:56:16,719
You’re the reason I got this power,

2472
02:56:17,578 --> 02:56:19,966
And you’re the reason why...

2473
02:56:20,849 --> 02:56:23,978
The world has slipped from my grasp!

2474
02:56:24,947 --> 02:56:26,284
When will it...

2475
02:56:27,377 --> 02:56:28,335
Be enough for you?

2476
02:56:28,356 --> 02:56:30,968
That’s exactly what our destiny is!

2477
02:56:32,419 --> 02:56:37,938
I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.

2478
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:41,968
And live in eternal glory!

2479
02:56:43,364 --> 02:56:45,102
JoJo...

2480
02:56:46,248 --> 02:56:48,256
You and I...

2481
02:56:49,047 --> 02:56:52,063
Are one and the same in this world!

2482
02:56:55,531 --> 02:56:58,214
Lord Dio! Look, look, look!

2483
02:56:58,243 --> 02:57:00,401
Please look!

2484
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:02,453
Jonathan!

2485
02:57:04,450 --> 02:57:06,781
<i>From light to darkness</i>

2486
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:08,918
<i>This is the start of my mythos</i>

2487
02:57:08,944 --> 02:57:11,105
<i>I will end it all</i>

2488
02:57:11,130 --> 02:57:13,154
<i>And restart it all</i>

2489
02:57:13,434 --> 02:57:15,855
<i>For this is Dio’s World!</i>

2490
02:57:15,879 --> 02:57:17,434
Right, Erina Joestar?

2491
02:57:17,449 --> 02:57:18,282
Dio!

2492
02:57:18,330 --> 02:57:22,084
<i>I can’t speak—can’t breathe—</i>

2493
02:57:22,613 --> 02:57:24,170
<i>My ripple!</i>

2494
02:57:24,430 --> 02:57:26,454
Erina! Not you too!

2495
02:57:27,145 --> 02:57:30,502
<i>This is the start of his mythos!</i>

2496
02:57:30,562 --> 02:57:36,196
<i>This ark is swarming with his followers!</i>

2497
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:39,298
Please, spare the child!

2498
02:57:40,058 --> 02:57:41,058
Run!

2499
02:57:41,282 --> 02:57:42,822
Shall we torture him to death?!

2500
02:57:42,849 --> 02:57:45,770
Or maybe enjoy watching him asphyxiate?!

2501
02:57:45,799 --> 02:57:46,887
Wang Chan!

2502
02:57:48,063 --> 02:57:52,245
<i>Painlessly cut his head
from his shoulders!</i>

2503
02:57:52,283 --> 02:57:54,577
<i>I won’t tolerate any insults!</i>

2504
02:57:54,605 --> 02:57:56,864
<i>My friend, Jonathan Joestar—</i>

2505
02:57:57,320 --> 02:58:00,532
<i>I’ll take you as my own</i>

2506
02:58:00,583 --> 02:58:06,079
<i>Your blood will become my future!</i>

2507
02:58:06,194 --> 02:58:09,592
<i>I’ll tie our futures together</i>

2508
02:58:10,299 --> 02:58:14,529
<i>With my final ripple!</i>

2509
02:58:14,632 --> 02:58:18,466
<i>JoJo!</i>

2510
02:58:18,774 --> 02:58:23,547
<i>JoJo!</i>

2511
02:58:34,031 --> 02:58:40,030
<i>I felt it tear. Something
important inside me just tore</i>

2512
02:58:40,156 --> 02:58:41,156
Jonathan!

2513
02:58:43,320 --> 02:58:45,310
ERINA: How could this be?!
JOJO: Get out of here!

2514
02:58:46,046 --> 02:58:48,045
I won’t, JoJo...

2515
02:58:48,820 --> 02:58:57,122
<i>I will burn with you</i>

2516
02:58:57,217 --> 02:59:05,392
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

2517
02:59:09,965 --> 02:59:12,227
<i>(The flash of flames)</i>

2518
02:59:12,300 --> 02:59:14,230
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2519
02:59:14,259 --> 02:59:16,330
<i>You can’t ask me to live!</i>

2520
02:59:16,355 --> 02:59:18,411
<i>There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

2521
02:59:18,445 --> 02:59:21,014
<i>JOJO: It’s alright if you cry
ERINA: Your courage is too cruel!</i>

2522
02:59:21,039 --> 02:59:22,870
<i>JOJO: You will be
ERINA: I will be</i>

2523
02:59:22,903 --> 02:59:26,572
<i>The one to spin the thread of fate</i>

2524
02:59:26,652 --> 02:59:30,588
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2525
02:59:26,991 --> 02:59:33,686
<i>Just like my mother
died for me, I’ll—</i>

2526
02:59:30,723 --> 02:59:34,937
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2527
02:59:35,007 --> 02:59:38,666
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2528
02:59:35,342 --> 02:59:37,228
<i>Farewell!</i>

2529
02:59:37,249 --> 02:59:38,976
<i>I’m still alive! </i>

2530
02:59:39,255 --> 02:59:44,932
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

2531
02:59:39,269 --> 02:59:42,967
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2532
02:59:45,228 --> 02:59:50,046
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

2533
02:59:50,091 --> 02:59:53,043
<i>JoJo!</i>

2534
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:01,629
I know what you’re like...

2535
03:00:03,471 --> 03:00:04,802
I figured...

2536
03:00:05,782 --> 03:00:07,258
You would strike...

2537
03:00:08,511 --> 03:00:09,953
Before I...

2538
03:00:13,222 --> 03:00:14,622
Lost consciousness.

2539
03:00:17,193 --> 03:00:18,193
JoJo?

2540
03:00:19,138 --> 03:00:20,646
Let me go, JoJo!

2541
03:00:24,555 --> 03:00:25,555
He’s...

2542
03:00:29,976 --> 03:00:30,976
Dead...

2543
03:00:53,368 --> 03:00:58,049
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

2544
03:01:07,921 --> 03:01:13,368
<i>That proud life of his</i>

2545
03:01:14,015 --> 03:01:18,068
<i>Vanished into the dusts of time</i>

2546
03:01:18,738 --> 03:01:22,958
<i>But this fateful adventure</i>

2547
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:28,225
<i>Will become an inheritance</i>

2548
03:01:28,315 --> 03:01:31,124
<i>Passed down forever</i>

2549
03:01:33,517 --> 03:01:35,771
<i>His golden spirit</i>

2550
03:01:35,831 --> 03:01:40,007
<i>(Phantom Blood)</i>

2551
03:01:45,837 --> 03:01:48,522
<i>Like two who make one,</i>

2552
03:01:49,086 --> 03:01:52,943
<i>We feel a bizarre friendship</i>

2553
03:01:54,155 --> 03:01:57,094
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

2554
03:01:58,040 --> 03:02:01,032
<i>If it weren’t for you...</i>

2555
03:02:01,064 --> 03:02:03,643
<i>No, it’s because of you</i>

2556
03:02:03,672 --> 03:02:05,941
<i>Hey, JoJo</i>

2557
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:09,247
<i>Now I’ll...</i>

2558
03:02:10,153 --> 03:02:14,435
<i>Keep looking at the stars</i>

2559
03:02:14,630 --> 03:02:21,172
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2560
03:02:21,995 --> 03:02:26,283
<i>We’ll reach out to the stars</i>

2561
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:32,753
<i>Our two fates</i>

2562
03:02:33,119 --> 03:02:36,609
<i>Have become one</i>

2563
03:02:34,257 --> 03:02:39,170
{\an8}<i>(That immortal poem echoes quietly)</i>

2564
03:02:39,247 --> 03:02:42,144
<i>Until the world</i>

{\an8}<i>(One saw stars)</i>

2566
03:02:44,517 --> 03:02:48,215
<i>Is born anew</i>

2567
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:48,349
{\an8}<i>(The stars are shimmering)</i>

2568
03:02:48,458 --> 03:02:50,805
{\an8}<i>(Like blood through a vein,
mud is pulsating)</i>

2569
03:02:50,309 --> 03:02:53,629
<i>I’ll live</i>

2570
03:02:51,133 --> 03:02:55,479
{\an8}<i>(One saw mud)</i>

2571
03:02:54,295 --> 03:02:57,008
<i>I’ll disappear</i>

2572
03:02:57,178 --> 03:03:07,872
<i>JOJO: With you!
DIO: I will live!</i>

2573
03:02:58,432 --> 03:03:03,837
{\an8}<i>(The sunlight yellow gleam shines)</i>

2574
03:03:03,892 --> 03:03:08,049
{\an8}<i>(Let the golden wind blow)</i>

2575
03:03:08,104 --> 03:03:13,623
{\an8}<i>(And the shadow of midnight
blue darkness grows)</i>

2576
03:03:10,871 --> 03:03:14,319
<i>(Living in the shadow of history)</i>

<i>(We’ll stop the flow of time)</i>

<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

2579
03:03:20,743 --> 03:03:23,767
<i>(The tale will keep on being told)</i>

2580
03:03:23,963 --> 03:03:29,995
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

2581
03:03:30,939 --> 03:03:39,973
<i>(Our golden spirit will shine)</i>

2582
03:03:45,556 --> 03:03:49,152
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

2583
03:08:27,648 --> 03:08:31,606
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.

2584
03:08:35,828 --> 03:08:37,539
This is a public [streamed] performance.

2585
03:08:37,805 --> 03:08:42,620
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,

2586
03:08:42,694 --> 03:08:46,239
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.

2587
03:08:49,036 --> 03:08:50,585
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.

2588
03:08:50,644 --> 03:08:54,931
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.

2589
03:08:55,008 --> 03:08:57,008
Thank you for today.

2590
03:09:00,200 --> 03:09:02,449
The musical will close tomorrow, though.

2591
03:09:02,759 --> 03:09:06,085
This type of role has been
played by others before,

2592
03:09:06,672 --> 03:09:10,452
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.

2593
03:09:10,768 --> 03:09:15,355
There have been many
things that led to this day.

2594
03:09:15,417 --> 03:09:21,486
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...

2595
03:09:21,795 --> 03:09:26,990
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...

2596
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:32,917
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.

2597
03:09:33,124 --> 03:09:35,708
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

2598
03:09:35,769 --> 03:09:39,406
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—

2599
03:09:39,473 --> 03:09:43,027
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.

2600
03:09:43,087 --> 03:09:45,443
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.

2601
03:09:45,509 --> 03:09:50,222
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.

2602
03:09:50,289 --> 03:09:52,785
From the bottom of my heart,

2603
03:09:52,834 --> 03:09:54,431
Pow.

2604
03:09:54,476 --> 03:09:56,476
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!

2605
03:10:08,699 --> 03:10:12,736
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.

2606
03:10:12,795 --> 03:10:14,795
Thank you for today!

2607
03:10:16,189 --> 03:10:18,618
Did you have fun, everyone?!

2608
03:10:19,808 --> 03:10:22,609
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.

2609
03:10:23,073 --> 03:10:27,068
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.

2610
03:10:27,129 --> 03:10:29,147
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.

2611
03:10:29,177 --> 03:10:32,227
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.

2612
03:10:32,260 --> 03:10:34,678
I—are you worried?

2613
03:10:34,719 --> 03:10:35,547
Nah, it’s probably okay.

2614
03:10:35,405 --> 03:10:37,171
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!

2615
03:10:36,152 --> 03:10:38,134
-He’s—that’s in the past.

2616
03:10:38,190 --> 03:10:41,635
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.

2617
03:10:41,704 --> 03:10:45,854
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.

2618
03:10:45,926 --> 03:10:49,794
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,

2619
03:10:49,860 --> 03:10:53,055
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.

2620
03:10:53,109 --> 03:10:54,802
And I’m relieved that we made it.

2621
03:10:54,857 --> 03:10:58,431
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!

2622
03:11:03,198 --> 03:11:07,771
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

2623
03:11:07,835 --> 03:11:09,909
But when we made it to opening day,

2624
03:11:09,983 --> 03:11:16,422
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,

2625
03:11:16,494 --> 03:11:17,995
Which has continued up through today.

2626
03:11:18,057 --> 03:11:22,989
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.

2627
03:11:23,085 --> 03:11:30,247
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.

2628
03:11:30,332 --> 03:11:33,534
For having supported us up to this point.

2629
03:11:33,590 --> 03:11:35,732
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.

2630
03:11:35,796 --> 03:11:40,327
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

2631
03:11:40,388 --> 03:11:41,922
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.

2632
03:11:42,162 --> 03:11:45,159
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.

2633
03:11:45,213 --> 03:11:47,114
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!

2634
03:11:47,159 --> 03:11:48,619
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.

2635
03:11:48,658 --> 03:11:49,628
Excuse yourself...

2636
03:11:49,675 --> 03:11:52,412
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.

2637
03:11:52,478 --> 03:11:56,782
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.

2638
03:11:56,839 --> 03:11:57,914
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.

2639
03:11:57,969 --> 03:12:02,059
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.

2640
03:12:02,103 --> 03:12:05,446
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.

2641
03:12:05,529 --> 03:12:06,924
You were just that wonderful.

2642
03:12:06,964 --> 03:12:08,280
[INAUDIBLE]

2643
03:12:08,324 --> 03:12:10,453
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...

2644
03:12:10,522 --> 03:12:15,855
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—

2645
03:12:15,963 --> 03:12:24,939
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.

2646
03:12:25,055 --> 03:12:31,664
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.

2647
03:12:31,867 --> 03:12:36,062
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

2648
03:12:36,135 --> 03:12:40,192
Thank you everyone in the cast!

2649
03:12:40,424 --> 03:12:44,302
It was wonderful. Thanks!

2650
03:12:49,223 --> 03:12:53,904
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

2651
03:12:53,972 --> 03:12:55,468
Now to everyone at the theatre,

2652
03:12:55,529 --> 03:13:00,110
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

2653
03:13:00,176 --> 03:13:02,700
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

2654
03:13:05,243 --> 03:13:05,949
Thanks!

2655
03:13:10,411 --> 03:13:13,594
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.

2656
03:13:13,717 --> 03:13:19,532
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!

2657
03:13:19,604 --> 03:13:21,810
Everyone, do your best!

2658
03:13:21,860 --> 03:13:23,860
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!

2659
03:13:25,620 --> 03:13:28,793
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?

2660
03:13:28,856 --> 03:13:32,213
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!

2661
03:13:32,362 --> 03:13:34,769
I’m gonna watch it too!

2662
03:13:36,384 --> 03:13:38,716
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

2663
03:13:39,172 --> 03:13:40,063
Pardon me.

2664
03:13:40,133 --> 03:13:46,942
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!

2665
03:13:55,368 --> 03:13:59,299
Truly, thank you for today!

2666

tomorrow’s performance too!

2672

Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

2673
