00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,120
You, watching this.

3
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,570
Yeah, you there.

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
You have been chosen.

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

6
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:37,350
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

7
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,463
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.

8
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:47,576
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.

9
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:52,690
It keeps moving forward.

10
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,803
That is why I have to
create this record now.

11
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
If something should
happen to me, I—

12
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Never mind.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Back to the story.

14
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:19,360
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

15
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,546
Such as medicine, pharmacy, and archaeology—

16
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:27,733
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

17
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:31,920
That’s how it looks on the outside.

18
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,106
Right, that’s the cover.

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Now, listen carefully.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,240
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,880
And created our branches around the world...

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,520
That secret is...

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
The Stone Mask.

24
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:20,910
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

26
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,320
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

27
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,200
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It all began in the 13th century.

29
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:55,522
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

30
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:58,670
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

31
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,817
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

32
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,966
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

33
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:08,113
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>

34
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:11,262
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

35
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:14,409
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>

36
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,558
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

37
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:20,705
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,080
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>

39
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,188
{\an8}<i>(Eternal!)</i>

40
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,594
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>

41
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>Taken in this hand</i>

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,405
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

43
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,811
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

44
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,217
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

45
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:40,622
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

46
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:42,028
<i>Blood of the living</i>

47
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:43,434
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>

48
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:44,840
<i>Life is power</i>

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,245
{\an8}<i>(We sacrifice!)</i>

50
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,651
<i>The power in this hand</i>

51
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,057
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
<i>(We are children of the sun!)</i>

53
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

58
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:24,475
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

59
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:28,125
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

60
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,775
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

61
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,425
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

62
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:39,075
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

63
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:42,725
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

64
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:46,375
Wot have we here!

65
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:50,025
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

66
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:53,675
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

67
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:57,325
-Hang on...

68
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,975
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

69
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:04,625
-Wait!

70
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,275
I said wait!

71
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:11,925
Yahoo!

72
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:15,575
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

73
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,225
Look at that fancy carriage,
they gotta be nobles!

74
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,875
It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

75
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,525
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

76
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:30,175
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This box’ll have somethin’ good...

78
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,250
What the—

79
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,750
Just a creepy mask!

80
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,250
Don’t need that!

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Darling!

82
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,250
What?!

83
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,750
In the carriage! A baby survived!

84
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
A baby?! Leave it there!

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

86
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh...

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,666
Well, isn’t this a nice ring? I’ll take that!

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
-What are you doing?

89
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,800
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Have a look!

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
A pocket watch too!

92
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,400
Nice teeth!

93
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.

94
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,800
That’s enough!

95
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

97
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,400
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You... Did you rescue us...?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are my wife and son...?

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,750
She croa—

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.

102
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Go get him!

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this too is fate...

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to express my gratitude
to you for saving my life...

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My name is Joestar...

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will never forget your kindness!

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Dario Brando!

109
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,350
And so the years flow by until 1880.

110
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,250
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

111
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,150
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,
we’re thirsty with desire)</i>

112
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,050
{\an8}They were caught up in a dream!

113
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,950
<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

114
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,850
{\an8}Their hands were reaching out!

115
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,750
<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride
in our queen, we pierce the horizon)</i>

116
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,650
{\an8}<i>(We pierce!)</i>

117
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,550
{\an8}The times have changed them!

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
<i>(In midnight blue darkness)</i>

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
<i>(We grovel and squirm to
get our hands on what we want)</i>

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
{\an8}<i>(We squirm!)</i>

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
{\an8}I hear those voices,

122
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
{\an8}Those oh-so-familiar voices!

123
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:13,346
<i>Well, your faces seem to be asking
“Who’s this?” so listen up!</i>

124
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:19,576
<i>Let me introduce myself:</i>

125
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:25,807
<i>Speedwagon’s in da house!</i>

126
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:32,038
<i>While I’m passing down this
story to the future generations,</i>

127
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:38,269
<i>Since it’ll all be yours, I might
as well tell you all what’s sweet</i>

128
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:44,500

<i>(The lamplight of the Industrial
Revolution burns bright)</i>

134

<i>(So we sleep with hope in our hearts)</i>

135

{\an8}Between the light and darkness!

136
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,875
<i>(Should strife and inequality judge you)</i>

137

<i>(Reach out your hand to

138
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,375
{\an8}And reach for the heavens!

139
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,625
<i>(Set your soul aflame in

141
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,125
<i>(The midnight blue darkness is growing)</i>

142
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,375
<i>(Throw away your fears,

<i>Light and dark, illumination and shadow
Front and back, two diverging paths</i>

<i>Challenge your God, seize your fortune

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Stop right there! I’ll kill you!

174
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:42,250
Oi!

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Shit—

176
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,000
Oi, brat! Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,666
C’mon, let’s go!

178
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:38,750
Stop!

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Nice!

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Stupid brat!

181
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,750
Hey, look at ‘im. Bastard!

182
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,250
Don’t let this brat go!

183
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,750
Little puke stain!

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What’re you looking at, smart-arse?

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oi!

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How’s your old man doing, shitstain?

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I haven’t seen him since
his pub went under!

188
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
He croak or somethin’?

189
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Word’s going around that
yer mum died in the plague!

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Shame, she was a real looker!

191
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
He should have sold her off
before she kicked the bucket!

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Dio! Can’t you hear me?! Dio!

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is it, Father?

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh... Do you need your medicine?

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Nah, I don’t need that.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
C’mere, I gotta tell you something.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Dio!

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I haven’t got much longer. I know it.

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oi!

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I’m worried that after I die...

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:35,000
My only child will be all by
himself. In that case... Dio,

202
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Take this.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
“Joestar”?

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He’s a noble.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And he owes me one.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When I die, send him that letter.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go to him.

208
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,750
He’ll take care of you, you can
go to school. Sounds good, don’t it?

209
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,250
Oh! Make sure you put a stamp on it!

210
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,750
Father...

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
<i>Now</i> you start acting like a parent?!

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Listen up...

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You’re a smart boy.

214
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:28,687
Don’t lose to anyone! Become
the richest man in the world!

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Dio!

216
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:35,812
<i>How’s it going, I ask myself</i>

217
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:42,937
<i>They keep taking from me,
and it’s driving me mad</i>

218
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:50,062
<i>This place reeks of all these deadbeats</i>

219
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:57,187
<i>I might already be in hell,
the way it makes me sick</i>

220
00:13:57,187 --> 00:14:04,312
<i>And yet, my mum told me to be noble</i>

221
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:11,437
<i>She held me and taught me to be proud</i>

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>“Hey Dio, look up at the stars”</i>

223
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>She kept on saying that,
until the illness took her</i>

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,666
Just like that...

225
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>Why are my hands always empty?</i>

226
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:40,000
<i>Am I just here to be taken from?</i>

227
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,666
<i>Tell me, Joestar, the sky
that you have over you</i>

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
<i>Is it blue?</i>

229
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,750
<i>Tell me, Joestar</i>

230
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:08,250
<i>This disgraceful father of
mine, the lowest of the low</i>

231
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,750
<i>A deadbeat will always be a deadbeat</i>

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
<i>Under this murky sky,</i>

233
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,875
<i>He struggled and struggled,
and this is how he’s gonna die</i>

234
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,125
<i>Now, I’ll go take this “inheritance”</i>

235
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,375
<i>I’ll use any means, yes,
to set me on my path</i>

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,000
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

237
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,625
<i>That means I’ll start from here</i>

238
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,375
<i>Tell me, Joestar, in the sky over you,</i>

239
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,125
<i>Is the sun shining?</i>

240
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
<i>It is, isn’t it, Joestar?</i>

241
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh yeah!

242
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,333
You’ve got something good today too, eh?

243
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:35,666
Give it back!

244
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:41,000
Over here!

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,333
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
My father’s a real doctor!

247
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Oh really? This hat looks expensive!

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!

249
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Stop right there!

250
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What are you doing?! Take this!

251
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!

252
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Ow! That hurt!

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
-Hey, do you know who this guy is?

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

255
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:35,937
I’m gonna give him even
more of a walloping!

256
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:38,562
Ah-ha!

257
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,187
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

258
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:43,812
Snotty little rich boy! You think
you’re so high and mighty?

259
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,437
Danny!

260
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:49,062
Eh?!

261
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:51,687
Let’s go already! Shit!

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Uh... Are you alright?

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Leave me alone!

264
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But...

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I did this because I wanted to.

266
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,600
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.

267
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,000
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,400
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

269
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
I’ll beat them, someday.

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let’s go, Danny!

271
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,250
Oh, wait!

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jonathan Joestar...

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You...

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You must be Dio Brando!

275
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And you’re...

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Jonathan Joestar?

277
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!

278
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,750
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

279
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,250
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!

280
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,750
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Friend?

282
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah!

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,666
Danny! What was that for!

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Danny!

285
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You won’t get away with this!

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Lord Joestar!

288
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
Come inside!

289
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,000
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Something wrong, JoJo?

291
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,800
Ah, nothing.

292
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

293
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.

294
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:24,500
Starting today, you are part of our family.

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Mister Brando!

296
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

297
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,760
Police? Has something happened?

298
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,277
Oh, no!

299
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:24,622
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

300
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:40,833
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.

301
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,967
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

302
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,312
Ah, that was—

303
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,657
-He came at me so suddenly.

304
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,002
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

305
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:36,347
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

306
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

307
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
JoJo!

308
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,560
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

309
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes, sir.

310
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes!

311
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
Good.

312
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Make sure to get along with each other.

314
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mister Brando!

316
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Nice to have met you!

317
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don’t touch my bag!

318
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,420
I was just trying to carry it for—

319
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,120
That’s enough.

320
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

321
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:26,903
Watch it!

322
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,760
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

323
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,920
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

324
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:31,910
Now then, let me get—

325
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
Ta-ta, JoJo!

326
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,080
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!

327
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,240
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.

332
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:15,320
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

333
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:24,120
Keep your stupid dog away from me!

334
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:32,919
Coming, Lord Joestar!

335
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:41,719
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

336
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?

337
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:52,182
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

338
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,557
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

339
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:58,932
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

340
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:02,307
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>

341
00:23:02,307 --> 00:23:05,682
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>

342
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:09,057
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

343
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:12,432
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>

344
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

345
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

346
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,120
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

347
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,919
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

348
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,719
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

349
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

350
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

351
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:50,120
It’s just because I love reading so much!

352
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:58,120
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

353
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:06,120
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

354
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:14,120
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>

355
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:22,120
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

356
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

357
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,370
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

358
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:30,120
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>

359
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,870
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

360
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:19,286
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>

361
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,370
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

362
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,870
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

363
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:25,620
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

364
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,370
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

365
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

366
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,870
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>

367
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,370
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>

368
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

369
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:54,884
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

370
00:24:54,884 --> 00:25:00,060
But...

371
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,235
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

372
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:10,412
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

377
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:41,750
And so she gave them this condition:

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here is my question for you:

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

382
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,000
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?

383
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,666
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?

385
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?

386
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:22,000
The stars?

387
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,666
Or the mud?

388
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think...

389
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,333
I...

390
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:30,000
I think they were looking at the mud.

391
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,666
What’s your reasoning?

392
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

393
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:52,500
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.

394
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!

395
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,300
They held onto their honour!

396
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:01,500
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,

397
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,500
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

398
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
So what!

399
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
So what?

400
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

401
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,250
But they—

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

403
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,750
They were left empty-handed
in the end!

404
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,250
Such regret...

405
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...

406
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!

407
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:21,428
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!

408
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,714
They held onto their
pride until the very end!

409
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:26,000
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!

410
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,285
Listen!

411
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:30,571
You’re a noble! You have it all!

412
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,857
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

414
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—

415
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,750
That’s enough, you two.

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There’s no right answer to this question.

417
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:52,818
Bear in mind—

418
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:57,363
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

419
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:01,909
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

420
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:06,454
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

421
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>

422
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,545
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>

423
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:20,090
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>

424
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,636
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>

425
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:29,181
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>

426
00:28:29,181 --> 00:28:33,727
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>

427
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:38,272
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

428
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:42,818
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

429
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:47,363
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>

430
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:51,909
<i>The opening bell rings</i>

431
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:56,454
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>

432
00:28:56,454 --> 00:29:01,000
Oi!

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,545
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!

434
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:10,090
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!

435
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,636
Our new champion!

436
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:19,181
You did it, JoJo!

437
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:23,727
Danny would be proud!

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Is there anyone?

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Everyone listen up!

441
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.

442
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
His name is Dio Brando!

443
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,625
Dio Brando?

444
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,375
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?

445
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,125
Yeah! Do it!

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, let’s do it!

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000
-Good!

448
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.

450
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That’s the bell!

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
-Go, JoJo!

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Beat him up!

453
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What is this move!

454
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I’ve never seen it before!

455
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,100
Oi, JoJo!

456
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,500
That’s a hit to the face!

457
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,900
He lost!

458
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,300
Our king! Our king!

459
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!

460
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,000
My eye!

461
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,333
Guys, guys, guys!

462
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think my finger went in his eye.

463
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,750
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!

464
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,583
-Hey, hey!

465
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:57,416
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?

466
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:01,250
Teach me!

467
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,083
Guys! Ow...

468
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Danny...

469
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?

470
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It feels like he’s invading my life.

471
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>

472
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>

473
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>

474
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>

475
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

476
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>

477
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

478
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

479
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You’re...

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My hanky...

481
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!

482
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

483
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So stop by again!

484
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Danny!

485
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Has it caught your fancy?

486
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.

487
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
It’s alright.

488
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,500
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.

489
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Mexico...

490
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:19,750
Mm-hmm.

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.

492
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.

493
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.

494
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you interested in it?

495
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, no. Not especially.

496
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,666
Uh...

497
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

498
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

499
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Friendship? With a dog?

500
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

501
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

502
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

503
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.

504
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,800
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.

505
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,000
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

506
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,199
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

507
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,400
It was Danny!

508
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

509
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.

510
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

511
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,600
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.

512
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
Is that so?

513
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
M’lord.

514
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

515
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Friends...

516
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,440
Erina!

517
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
JoJo!

518
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,000
The two met once more!

519
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,880
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

520
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,140
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

521
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Danny!

522
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Come boy!

523
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,310
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

524
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

525
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Huh? It’s nothing.

526
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,280
What are you hiding?

527
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,880
It’s nothing interesting.

528
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

529
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
You’ll just laugh!

530
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I won’t laugh.

531
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
You’ll tell people!

532
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
I won’t tell, so show me!

533
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
I told you, no!

534
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
JoJo!

535
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,180
Oh, my!

536
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,380
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>

537
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,580
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

538
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,779
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>

539
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:26,980
Oh!

540
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,880
<i>To be laughing like this</i>

541
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:38,580
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

542
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,713
<i>Erina</i>

543
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>JoJo</i>

544
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,529
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

545
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,280
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

546
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>JoJo</i>

547
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>Erina</i>

548
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,080
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

549
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,080
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

550
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,265
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

551
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:22,722
<i>That would be so
embarrassing, you—</i>

552
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:28,180
<i>Scoundrel!</i>

553
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,637
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>

554
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:39,094
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

555
00:37:39,094 --> 00:37:44,551
<i>Your hand,</i>

556
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,880
<i>My hand,</i>

557
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,600
<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>

558
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,080
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

559
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,560
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>

560
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,040
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>

561
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
It’s already this late!

562
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

563
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Erina!

564
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I’ll see you tomorrow!

565
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Yes, JoJo!

566
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Danny!

567
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>

568
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,280
What do you...

569
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,280
<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>

570
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Umm...

571
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,530
Hey!

572
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,280
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

573
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:51,280
I heard you were hanging
out with JoJo today.

574
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:30,280
He...

575
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
He did it!

576
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

577
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You haven’t, have you?

578
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:02,166
I’ve got goosebumps!
I want to be just like him!

579
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The first person you kissed wasn’t JoJo...

580
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:06,500
He does the things we’re too chicken
to, and with such confidence too!

581
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That’s our Dio!

582
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It was me, Dio!

583
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You know what this sort of thing
means for a lady’s reputation, right?

584
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Hey!

585
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
She’s—!

586
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You bitch!

587
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
What are you doing washing
my kiss away with mud?!

588
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:36,625
<i>Dio...</i>

589
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:42,375
<i>Dio...</i>

590
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:48,125
Get up, bitch!

591
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What’re you sleeping for?

592
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oi, why’s the booze gone?!

593
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Who do you think puts
food on the table? Stupid bitch!

594
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hey, now go buy some booze!

595
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Are you talking back?!

596
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:19,500
Father, mother’s clearly not well!

597
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

598
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:08,416
<i>Dio...</i>

599
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:09,250
Please, you’ve got to get well!

600
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:10,083
In tough times like these, I’ve
gotta work for your sake too.

601
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:10,916
I’ve hurt you. I’m a good-for-nothin’.
Please forgive me!

602
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I’m sorry! Please forgive me!

603
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:11,750
Of course you shouldn’t go to the shops!

604
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:33,750
-Mum! Mum!

605
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:31,166
She’s just fakin’ it!

606
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:44,500
You got money from that
factory job, don’t ya?

607
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:12,333
But our money’s already—

608
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:16,750
Mum! Mum!

609
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
-Stop it, Father!

610
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oi, you hear me?

611
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:25,000
Dio boy, go and buy me booze!

612
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

613
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Please, leave some money
for medicine at least!

614
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You’re really gonna
disobey me, you bastard?

615
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Father!

616
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You really expect me to
work my arse off for you? Idiot!

617
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You’re all trying to make a fool of me!

618
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
After all the trouble I went
through to nick that noble’s shit!

619
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That’s it. That noble, Joestar.

620
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Why don’t I send him a letter...

621
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:18,750
No...

622
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You and I are different!

623
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Dio!!

624
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:37,750
<i>Dio...</i>

625
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:46,250
<i>Dio, how could you do such a thing?
How could you hurt her like that!</i>

626
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:29,333
<i>Dio...</i>

627
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Dio!

628
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:54,750
<i>What in the world have I ever done
to you?! Can you tell me, Dio?</i>

629
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,400
<i>Aren’t you using my name</i>

630
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:40,000
<i>Dio...</i>

631
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:47,500
<i>But now there is a single
flame that burns in my heart</i>

632
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,000
<i>DIO: A little too lightly?
JOJO: I’ll never forgive you!</i>

633
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
<i>Dio...</i>

634
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:52,500
I admired you!

635
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
<i>You’re so amazing, so
much more than I am</i>

636
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,600
<i>So you’ve heard? What I
did to your beloved Erina?</i>

637
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,200
-You’ve disgraced her!

638
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,800
DIO: I bet you’re mad with jealousy!
<i>JOJO: This is for her sake, not mine!</i>

639
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,400
<i>I have to stand up to him, even
if I can’t beat him. I cannot lose!</i>

640
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,000
<i>Control your emotions, you’re
different from that drunken lout</i>

641
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,600
<i>On the blood resonating in my heart,
I swear to restore her honour, Dio! </i>

642
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,200
<i>I’ll put you back in your place,
I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget</i>

643
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Come at me!

644
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:59,500
<i>This new power arising within me</i>

645
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Dio!

646
00:44:02,250 --> 00:43:54,750
<i>You’re the one who lit this fire in me</i>

647
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:24,250
<i>I won’t stop beating you until you cry!</i>

648
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It feels so good!

649
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Dio...

650
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:45,000
That stupid kiss of yours hurt
me more than you intended!

651
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
<i>How dare you do this to me?</i>

652
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,200
<i>You miserable insect!</i>

653
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,000
<i>You scum of the earth!</i>

654
00:44:45,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Ah... Eri—

655
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,800
<i>How dare such scum like
you come at me, Dio!</i>

656
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:30,750
You two! You’ll be punished for this!
Now go back to your rooms!

657
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,600
<i>Me, the great Dio!</i>

658
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What on earth is going on?!

659
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I feel so miserable!

660
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I’ve never felt pain like this before...

661
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Erina!

662
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Erina...

663
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Erina! Did you say goodbye
to all your friends?

664
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Yes, Father.

665
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I underestimated JoJo.

666
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,750
I’m sorry for imposing my career
on you. Even though I know you—

667
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Let’s go.

668
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I’ll make friends over there too.

669
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
His explosive power...

670
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
His resilience...

671
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I have to become stronger...

672
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that I can become
a gentleman at heart!

673
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I have to control my anger and stay calm...

674
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So that I can take everything from him!

675
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
However...

676
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What’s that noise?

677
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Could someone be
inside the incinerator?

678
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Are they trying to get out?!

679
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,500
Ah, it burns!

680
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,833
Danny!!

681
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh my god...

682
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Someone! Someone please help!

683
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
<i>Seven years passed from that day</i>

684
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
<i>Times are changing,
the Victorian era’s flying by us</i>

685
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
<i>Population increasing to
the point of overflowing</i>

686
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:04,000
<i>Art and entertainment
are showered in praise</i>

687
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,333
<i>In the middle of this
unstoppable flow, agitation rages</i>

688
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:10,666
<i>The height of development,
the growth of British culture</i>

689
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:14,000
<i>But what goes up, must come
down. It’s only natural</i>

690
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,333
<i>That the top runners are being singled out</i>

691
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:20,666
<i>London’s peace has one
of its fingers broken</i>

692
00:48:20,666 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>Chaotic days mix the old and the new</i>

693
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,333
<i>The map of London
paints a stark contrast</i>

694
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
<i>Just like the current state of the country</i>

695
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,400
<i>Put the focus on the
dark parts and you’ll see</i>

696
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,000
<i>The curtain of swaying inequality</i>

697
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,600
<i>In this market still
learning from its past!</i>

698
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,200
You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

699
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The one excavated from Mexico?

700
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
From Mexico, you say?

701
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It was quite a while ago...

702
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
A while?! Could you please clarify?

703
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,250
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

704
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

705
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And bought it from me at a high price—

706
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,250
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

707
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

708
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Who the hell are you anyway?

709
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,500
I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

710
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.

711
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
All the way from Italy?!

712
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yes.

713
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...

714
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The sun will be setting soon.

715
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I’ll go check in the books!

716
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.

717
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:10,750
I don’t trust you...

718
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:37,846
A fog has rolled in...

719
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Wait a minute!

720
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:43,076
<i>(A palpable shadow stretches over the city)
</i>

721
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:48,307
<i>(And soon it’ll swallow the sun whole)</i>

722
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:30,500
Just a little word of warning...

723
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Thank you.

724
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:53,538
<i>(Don’t let it get you,
fight as hard as you can!)</i>

725
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:58,769
<i>(Fog and smog cover the city,
hiding the smell of crime)</i>

726
00:49:58,769 --> 00:50:04,000
<i>(Stretch out your hands towards the light)</i>

727
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,230
<i>(We won’t sink down to hell!)</i>

728
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:14,461
<i>The filth rubs off on the clean
and gathers like grime</i>

729
00:50:14,461 --> 00:50:19,692
<i>Thrown away with the rubbish</i>

730
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:24,923
<i>Pressed together, our
lot gives off a stench</i>

731
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:30,153
<i>The sweet smell of darkness</i>

732
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:35,384
<i>Is comforting to us</i>

733
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,600
<i>(Something’s wrong, people
 are thirsty, distorted, broken!)</i>

734
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:53,400
<i>(Jack the Ripper has drawn first blood!)</i>

735
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:01,200
<i>(Hate the poor, hate the
rich, and raise your voice)</i>

736
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(Gather here and now, Jacks of this town!)</i>

737
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(Rebellion is now!)</i>

738
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>In 1887, in Trafalgar Square</i>

739
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(We raise our voices!)</i>

740
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(Give us equality! Work! And money!)</i>

741
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>The rich in their ivory towers</i>

742
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(They look on at us and laugh!)</i>

743
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(Give us food! Every day! Let us live!)</i>

744
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(The world is ever accelerating)</i>

745
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>Rebellion is stopped in its tracks,
blood floods the streets of London</i>

746
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>Away from there now, in Liverpool,
seven years have flown by</i>

747
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>Their graduation year</i>

748
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>Their graduation? But who are “they”?</i>

749
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>From inside the scrum
they head for victory</i>

750
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>So dazzling, brightly
shining, a pair of stars</i>

751
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,800
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices!)</i>

752
00:51:21,432 --> 00:51:24,696
He’s got it!

753
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:27,960
The star of Hugh Hudson, our very
own Jonathan Joestar, grabs the pass!

754
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,224
<i>(He’s like a heavy locomotive!)</i>

755
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:34,488
{\an8}<i>(One’s on his back!)</i>

756
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:37,752
<i>(He can’t be toppled)</i>

757
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:41,016
{\an8}<i>(And a second!)</i>

758
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:44,280
<i>(Keep pushing forward, JoJo!)</i>

759
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,544
{\an8}<i>(Bloody hell!)</i>

760
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:50,808
<i>(The pride of our school!)</i>

761
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:54,072
{\an8}<i>(Incredible!)</i>

762
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:57,336
<i>(Hugh Hudson’s acclaimed JoJo!)</i>

763
00:51:57,336 --> 00:52:00,600
{\an8}<i>(And a fourth!)</i>

764
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,864
<i>(Is he finally wavering?)</i>

765
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:07,128
{\an8}Someone caught the pass!

766
00:52:07,128 --> 00:52:10,392
<i>(None other than the great star Dio)</i>

767
00:52:10,392 --> 00:52:13,656
{\an8}<i>(Dio Brando)</i>

768
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:16,920
<i>(Leaving them all behind)</i>

769
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,184
<i>(Once again, Dio catches the pass)</i>

770
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:23,448
{\an8}<i>(Nobody can catch up to him)</i>

771
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:26,712
<i>(They move like clockwork! You’d
almost feel bad for their rivals!)</i>

772
00:52:26,712 --> 00:52:29,976
<i>(Our school’s pride!)</i>

773
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:33,240
{\an8}<i>(Truly!)</i>

774
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,504
<i>(JoJo and Dio!)</i>

775
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:39,768
<i>(In perfect harmony, they
make the best partners!)</i>

776
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,400
JoJo! Your pass won’t go to waste!

777
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Try!!

778
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,400
The final match of the
season ends in victory!

779
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,400
That was magnificent!

780
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Dio!

781
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:57,900
It was all thanks to your pass!

782
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,566
Let’s go and tell Father
about it right away!

783
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,233
Right, JoJo?

784
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:02,900
Uh-huh.

785
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,400
JoJo!

786
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,566
Dio!

787
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Can we write about your friendship
with JoJo for the school newspaper?

788
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,200
Thanks!

789
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,400
Let me get changed first.

790
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,600
Shall we go home together?

791
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,800
Yeah.

792
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:23,400
<i>Time passed like the
endless flow of water</i>

793
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,400
<i>Ever since you started
calling him “Father”</i>

794
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:37,400
<i>I think of that word
which is so familiar to me</i>

795
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:45,400
<i>Seven years spent studying diligently</i>

796
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:52,400
<i>You’re... beautiful,
and a true gentleman</i>

797
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,400
<i>My friend, who’s always
pushing me to be better</i>

798
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,400
<i>You’ve repented for the
wrong you did to Erina</i>

799
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:17,650
<i>You’ve offered me a shoulder
to lean on, now that Danny’s gone</i>

800
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>We walked this path
together for seven years</i>

801
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>I always followed in your
footsteps, one step behind,</i>

802
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:37,400
<i>So why is it that I don’t
feel any friendship for you?</i>

803
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,400
How are you feeling?

804
00:54:45,912 --> 00:54:52,937
Well, I’m old enough now that
a mere cold can last a long time.

805
00:54:52,937 --> 00:54:59,962
Sir, you’re not that old yet!

806
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:06,987
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!

807
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,500
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...

808
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,375
Seem to have won!

809
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Ah, Dio is a proper member
of the Joestar family now!

810
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.

811
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,500
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!

812
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,500
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

813
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I...

814
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
I admire you! Back then—

815
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
My lord!

816
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Yes?

817
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I’m home!

818
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Dio! Welcome back!
Ah, and JoJo as well!

819
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Father!

820
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Are you alright?

821
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I can’t get rid of this cough...

822
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Today, the doctor recommended
I be admitted to hospital.

823
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,500
I object!

824
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,500
These days, hospitals
only care about profits!

825
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
They say it’s a problem in London too.

826
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,500
It’s true...

827
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,500
I feel safer at home.

828
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,000
I give in.

829
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,333
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.

830
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,666
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!

831
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,000
What?!

832
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,333
What?!

833
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
You already know?

834
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:33,500
How?

835
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Inspector Archer here told me.

836
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
How rude of you, inspector!

837
00:56:39,666 --> 00:56:40,000
Huh?

838
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,333
We...

839
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,500
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...

840
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
So we rushed home!

841
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Oh no, silly me!

842
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,500
I truly am proud.

843
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,500
I have such wonderful sons.

844
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Especially you, Dio.

845
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
You’ve worked so very hard.

846
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.

847
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
I was born poor...

848
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
But you gave me a chance.

849
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Thank you.

850
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

851
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,500
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.

852
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,500
But this is Liverpool!

853
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:51,000
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

854
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Well then, I’ll be off.

855
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Now, if you’ll pardon me.

856
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...

857
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Who on earth made this...

858
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,000
And for what reason?

859
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,666
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.

860
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,500
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

861
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,000
This is...

862
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Dario Brando?

863
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,400
Thank you again, Master Dio—

864
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, it’s the least I could do.

865
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,600
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.

866
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,200
“Right now... I’m sick.”

867
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
“I’ll probably die.”

868
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,750
“My heart hurts,”

869
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,250
“My hands shake,”

870
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,750
“And I can’t stop coughing.”

871
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:13,250
<i>Dio...</i>

872
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,750
<i>Dio...</i>

873
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,500
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

874
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,500
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

875
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,500
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

876
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,500
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

877
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

878
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,500
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

879
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:49,550
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

880
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,916
I know!

881
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:56,283
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!

882
00:59:56,283 --> 00:59:59,649
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>

883
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:03,016
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>

884
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,000
I don’t bloody need it anymore!

885
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,375
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

886
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,625
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>

887
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,875
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

888
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

889
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:30,500
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

890
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:35,500
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>

891
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,500
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

892
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,500
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

893
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,500
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

894
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:55,500
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

895
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:00,500
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

896
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:05,500
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

897
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,500
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

898
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,500
Dio!

899
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,500
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

900
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What’s the matter, JoJo?

901
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

902
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.

903
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Huh?

904
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Show me that.

905
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

906
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

907
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What is this non—

908
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Answer me!

909
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

910
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

911
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
JoJo...

912
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,

913
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then you doubt our very friendship.

914
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,400
Dio,

915
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,000
As a gentleman,

916
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,600
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.

917
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,200
If you can swear on your father’s honour,

918
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I’ll never speak of this again.

919
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Swear on it.

920
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!

921
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!

922
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:20,750
Dio,

923
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!

924
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Swear on that guy?

925
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!

926
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Give me the medicine back!

927
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!

928
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I’m convinced now...

929
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!

930
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I’ll protect the Joestar family.

931
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!

932
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Just a misunderstanding...

933
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Besides...

934
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?

935
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

936
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes,

937
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,500
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

938
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,500
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

939
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
JoJo...

940
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
JoJo! JoJo!!

941
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Is something the matter, Master Dio?

942
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
No...

943
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I’m alright...

944
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

945
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
It’s too late to turn back now.

946
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

947
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>

948
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Father!

949
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!

950
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-Father!

951
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I’m going to London
for two or three days.

952
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,500
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.

953
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:14,750
What’s all this ruckus for?

954
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Please don’t accept any care
or medicine from anyone else.

955
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Excuse me, but—

956
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We’ll do as he says.

957
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don’t know what’s going on...

958
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,500
But I trust my son!

959
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Father...

960
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Thank you, Father.

961
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Seven years ago, this thing...

962
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It moved in reaction to my blood.

963
01:04:39,312 --> 01:04:47,937
With this...

964
01:04:47,937 --> 01:04:56,562
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

965
01:04:56,562 --> 01:05:05,187
JoJo...

966
01:05:05,187 --> 01:05:13,812
Your own research...

967
01:05:13,812 --> 01:05:22,437
Will be the death of you!

968
01:05:22,437 --> 01:05:31,062
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>

969
01:05:31,062 --> 01:05:39,687
<i>Turning my eyes to the stars
and praying for an antidote</i>

970
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
<i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>

971
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
<i>Now I’ve arrived here
in this town steeped in mud</i>

972
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
<i>Ogre Street, the place
where plagues are born</i>

973
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>

974
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>

975
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
<i>Even if I were to lose
this right hand of mine</i>

976
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:08,272
<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>

977
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:08,454
<i>At long last our meeting takes place</i>

978
01:06:08,454 --> 01:06:08,636
<i>There’s a scent in the air
and it smells like prey</i>

979
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:08,818
<i>Sniffing you out through the
storm someone’s making his way</i>

980
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:09,000
<i>It’s time for your
leader to take the stage</i>

981
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,181
<i>(Ogre Street, we devour anything we can)</i>

982
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:09,363
<i>(Ogre Street, here everything meets its end)</i>

983
01:06:09,363 --> 01:06:09,545
<i>Dunno what the hell
you came here for</i>

984
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:09,727
<i>Bet you thought you
stood a good chance, huh?</i>

985
01:06:09,727 --> 01:06:09,909
<i>In a moment we’ll
devour all that hope</i>

986
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
<i>This is Ogre Street and
we’re the ogres, duh!</i>

987
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:20,181
<i>Got no problem with you bein’ naïve,
I’m just showin’ you the simple reality</i>

988
01:06:20,181 --> 01:06:25,636
<i>Hey hey hey,
how about it, rich boy?</i>

989
01:06:25,636 --> 01:06:31,090
<i>Want a taste of the
edge of this knife?</i>

990
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:36,545
<i>We’re gonna strip you of all that you got
Put up a fight and your life will be lost</i>

991
01:06:36,545 --> 01:06:42,000
<i>This is Ogre Street!
Ain’t it obvious that we’d cheat?</i>

992
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,454
<i>Us have-nots are gonna
steal your riches away!</i>

993
01:06:47,454 --> 01:06:52,909
<i>From your life to that foolish
heart—we’ll steal ‘em away!</i>

994
01:06:52,909 --> 01:06:58,363
<i>Tail between your legs, you can
save your own skin by runnin’ away!</i>

995
01:06:58,363 --> 01:07:03,818
{\an8}Is this guy insane?!

996
01:07:03,818 --> 01:07:09,272
<i>(Ogre Street, go on and leave it all behind)</i>

997
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
{\an8}<i>I don’t care if I lose four fingers!</i>

998
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:21,821
<i>(Ogre Street, we’ll even fill
our stomachs with your life)</i>

999
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:27,035
<i>I came here for a reason!</i>

1000
01:07:27,035 --> 01:07:32,250
<i>You said you’re fine with
losing four fingers, hah?</i>

1001
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:37,464
<i>(Ogre Street, why don’t we
put that resolve to the test?)</i>

1002
01:07:37,464 --> 01:07:42,678
Hold on! I only came here
looking for a poison seller!

1003
01:07:42,678 --> 01:07:47,892
Quit bluffin’! Let me have a
go at this soft little rich boy!

1004
01:07:47,892 --> 01:07:53,107
That’s the sound of blade hitting bone!

1005
01:07:53,107 --> 01:07:58,321
<i>Made the mistake of my life, pickin’
a fight with this fearless tough guy</i>

1006
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:03,535
<i>Countdown to my final breath—</i>

1007
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1008
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:13,964
Stop, everyone!

1009
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:19,178
I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!

1010
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:24,392
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?

1011
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I came here for the sake of my father.

1012
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:29,750
So in the moment I kicked,

1013
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.

1014
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.

1015
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Tell me your name!

1016
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Jonathan Joestar.

1017
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:01,625
Mr. Joestar, if you’re looking
for poison, that’d be Wang Chan.

1018
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,375
Be careful, he’s a crafty one!

1019
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,125
Someone bandage his wound.

1020
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I, Speedwagon, will lead you to his shop!

1021
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why?!

1022
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
‘Cause I’ve taken a liking to ya!

1023
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
<i>(Ogre Street)</i>

1024
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
<i>With your determination to fight</i>

1025
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
<i>(Ogre Street, you’ve lit in
us a glowing guiding light)</i>

1026
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
<i>(You, who have the courage)</i>

1027
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
<i>(To see the stars down here in the mud)</i>

1028
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
<i>(Light up the darkness with
your unwavering heart!)</i>

1029
01:09:46,714 --> 01:09:52,142
<i>Your refreshing sunlight</i>

1030
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:57,571
<i>Brought me completely to my knees</i>

1031
01:09:57,571 --> 01:10:03,000
<i>This must be some
strange twist of fate!</i>

1032
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,428
<i>Let’s toast—to our meeting!</i>

1033
01:10:08,428 --> 01:10:13,857
JoJo...

1034
01:10:13,857 --> 01:10:19,285
JoJo...!

1035
01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:24,714
<i>Dio...</i>

1036
01:10:24,714 --> 01:10:30,142
JoJo has gone off to London...

1037
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:35,571
Could he have died a dog’s death already?

1038
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:41,000
<i>Dio...</i>

1039
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,428
Or could he have found
evidence of the medicine?

1040
01:10:46,428 --> 01:10:51,857
Which is it?!

1041
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:57,285
<i>Dio...</i>

1042
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Booze! I can’t help but drink!

1043
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1044
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

1045
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
-Shut up, get out of my head!

1046
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000
<i>You’re the only one I care about</i>

1047
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
<i>Become the richest man!</i>

1048
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
-You piece of shit, we’re not the same!

1049
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Watch where you’re going, twat!

1050
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Oi, are you listening, you stupid brat?

1051
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You should ask yer mum to hold
you by the hand next time!

1052
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
What’re you mumbling about?!

1053
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1054
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Didn’t you hear me?

1055
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oi! You piece of shit—

1056
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:34,000
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1057
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
{\an8}<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1058
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,750
You filthy old tramps with
no sense of personal hygiene...

1059
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:32,000
{\an8}<i>You’re my clever boy!</i>

1060
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,250
{\an8}<i>Are you stupid? Oi, Dio!</i>

1061
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,750
How dare you! You bastard!

1062
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Interesting, this is a good
opportunity to try it out!

1063
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,250
What did you do to my mate?!

1064
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,750
{\an8}<i>One man’s misfortune...</i>

1065
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:44,000
{\an8}<i>Is another man’s fortune!</i>

1066
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I’ll kill you!

1067
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
It’s a live human experiment!

1068
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,750
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1069
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
JoJo!

1070
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:17,500
I’ll find the answer to your
research myself right now!

1071
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,833
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1072
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
What...

1073
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
What—

1074
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,000
{\an8}<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

1075
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What is this light?

1076
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Was I hallucinating?

1077
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
He’s dead...

1078
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
The spikes pierced so deep into his skull,
it must have killed him instantly.

1079
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.

1080
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
He’s not dead!

1081
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Fangs?! What is he?!

1082
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:02,900
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>

1083
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:09,500
He’s sucking my blood!

1084
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:16,100
His face is...

1085
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:22,700
Becoming younger?!

1086
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,860
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!

1087
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:43,930
I was saved...

1088
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:51,976
By the sunlight...

1089
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
He turned into ash...

1090
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Ow!

1091
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1092
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So this...

1093
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So, where is Dio?

1094
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1095
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I’ll call for reinforcements right away.

1096
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Please use the foyer.

1097
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Thank you.

1098
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:40,000
-You there!
-Sir!

1099
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,333
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.

1100
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yes sir!

1101
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,750
Oi, come on!

1102
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,250
JoJo...

1103
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,750
I apologise.

1104
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This is my cross to bear.

1105
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
What?

1106
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
If only I had made sure
that man was exiled...

1107
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I...

1108
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Dio’s father...

1109
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,300
Dario Brando.

1110
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,200
What do you mean?

1111
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,500
I’ll tell you about it.

1112
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,500
Did he tell you...

1113
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,700
This happened when you were a baby.

1114
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:38,625
I arrested the criminal!

1115
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,000
This is certainly my ring,

1116
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,500
But I never reported a theft.

1117
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,200
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.

1118
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,800
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1119
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,900
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1120
01:15:32,350 --> 01:16:18,049
That I gave him this ring?

1121
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,700
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1122
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,100
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,

1123
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,200
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1124
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,000
Would you like to see for yourself?

1125
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,100
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1126
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,150
He’s certain to be exiled!

1127
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,850
I see.

1128
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,549
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1129
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Brando?!

1130
01:16:08,299 --> 01:16:09,100
Oh, bollocks.

1131
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,900
Then that means—

1132
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,900
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,

1133
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,600
But a thief!

1134
01:16:17,325 --> 01:16:20,775
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.

1135
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,200
Why?

1136
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:23,575
I...

1137
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,100
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.

1138
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,700
Yes, he said that. A lie!

1139
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,800
It’s not a lie.

1140
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,100
This is what I gave him.

1141
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,500
He is innocent.

1142
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,300
But it’s a memento of your wife!

1143
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,400
Mr. Brando,

1144
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,800
This is yours.

1145
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,100
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.

1146
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

1147
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>

1148
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,700
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>

1149
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,700
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>

1150
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,200
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>

1151
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
Thank you, sir!

1152
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,000
You are too good-natured!

1153
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,100
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!

1154
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,400
That may be true,

1155
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
But think about it the other way around.

1156
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:26,800
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>

1157
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,800
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>

1158
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:36,550
<i>That pain</i>

1159
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:46,800
<i>Everything is connected</i>

1160
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:57,000
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

1161
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,800
<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>

1162
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:10,600
I can’t see stars or nothin’!
That’s bollocks!

1163
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:17,400
That’s why...

1164
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:29,800
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1165
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:36,300
<i>That this gold I’ve passed on</i>

1166
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:40,633
<i>Will shine one day</i>

1167
01:19:40,633 --> 01:19:44,966
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>

1168
01:19:44,966 --> 01:19:49,300
<i>I will defy fate!</i>

1169
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:53,633
Inspector.

1170
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
I’ll wait for Dio.

1171
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
He can still be stopped.

1172
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1173
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.

1174
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then...

1175
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.

1176
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...

1177
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:50,250
<i>It’s a wedge driven into
the wasteland of my memory</i>

1178
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

1179
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:12,250
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>

1180
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>

1181
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I have the antidote now.

1182
01:21:23,714 --> 01:21:29,142
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>

1183
01:21:29,142 --> 01:21:34,571
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>

1184
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
The Stone Mask...

1185
01:21:34,571 --> 01:21:40,000
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1186
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:55,400
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.

1187
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,428
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1188
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:54,200
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.

1189
01:21:45,428 --> 01:21:50,857
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>

1190
01:21:50,857 --> 01:21:56,285
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”

1191
01:21:54,200 --> 01:22:07,000
I, Dio, was...

1192
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:15,000
It truly hurts me.

1193
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1194
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:19,800
Shit...

1195
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:34,600
Although you might not believe me,

1196
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:32,600
JoJo...

1197
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:54,200
Those are my true feelings.

1198
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I see you’ve returned from London—

1199
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I understand, JoJo.

1200
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You’re honest like that.

1201
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1202
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
The final one
I will ask of you.

1203
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Can you give me more time?

1204
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:24,500
Time—

1205
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
To turn myself in to the police.

1206
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Eh?

1207
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I...

1208
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:44,000
R-Regret the choices I’ve
made throughout my life.

1209
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,333
Because I was born into squalor...

1210
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:54,666
My ambition was relentless.

1211
01:23:54,666 --> 01:24:00,000
What I did was terrible!

1212
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,333
I want to repent for my sins!

1213
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Don’t believe a word he says!

1214
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:21,250
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.

1215
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Allow me to introduce myself!

1216
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I’m Speedwagon, the meddler!

1217
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Growing up in the darkest slums,

1218
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.

1219
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.

1220
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
This guy reeks!

1221
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Worse than vomit!

1222
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
He was born evil!

1223
01:24:51,207 --> 01:24:55,622
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1224
01:24:55,622 --> 01:25:00,037
This man has confessed already.

1225
01:25:00,037 --> 01:25:04,452
Father...

1226
01:25:04,452 --> 01:25:08,867
I’ve heard everything I need to.

1227
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:13,282
I will return to my bed to rest.

1228
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:17,697
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.

1229
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,880
Come on—

1230
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:22,112
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...

1231
01:25:19,226 --> 01:25:23,920
JoJo, I understand!

1232
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,613
Arrest me.

1233
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,320
He was born with an innate destiny.

1234
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:17,860
Silence!

1235
01:25:28,613 --> 01:25:33,306
But, if it’s not too much to ask;

1236
01:25:33,306 --> 01:25:38,000
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1237
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,693
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.

1238
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,720
Be careful!

1239
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,640
Agreed.

1240
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,240
I will handcuff you.

1241
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,640
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1242
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:08,640
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1243
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,640
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1244
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,640
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1245
01:26:20,711 --> 01:26:24,854
What’re you talking about?

1246
01:26:24,854 --> 01:26:28,997
<i>You know, JoJo...</i>

1247
01:26:28,997 --> 01:26:33,140
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1248
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:37,282
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1249
01:26:37,282 --> 01:26:41,425
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1250
01:26:41,425 --> 01:26:45,568
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1251
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>

1252
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:55,140
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1253
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,806
<i>That murky sky up there,</i>

1254
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,640
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1255
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:06,015
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1256
01:27:06,015 --> 01:27:08,265
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1257
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,515
<i>That’s why, now is the time</i>

1258
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:16,640
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1259
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,640
<i>The stars!</i>

1260
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,640
<i>And seize...</i>

1261
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:29,140
The Stone Mask?

1262
01:27:29,140 --> 01:27:34,140
<i>I...</i>

1263
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:39,140
<i>I...</i>

1264
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Father...

1265
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:44,140
<i>Reject...</i>

1266
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:36,211
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.

1267
01:27:42,497 --> 01:27:39,354
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...

1268
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:42,497
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

1269
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,640
<i>My humanity!</i>

1270
01:27:48,782 --> 01:27:45,640
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1271
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,640
JoJo...

1272
01:27:51,925 --> 01:27:48,782
Your late mother’s ring.

1273
01:27:52,723 --> 01:27:54,890
<i>JoJo!</i>

1274
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:57,056
Stop!

1275
01:27:55,068 --> 01:27:51,925
This is...

1276
01:27:57,056 --> 01:27:59,223
-JoJo!
-Father!

1277
01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:01,390
Dio!

1278
01:28:01,390 --> 01:28:03,556
Dio!

1279
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,640
Shoot him!

1280
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,640
Shoot him!

1281
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:18,140
Lord Joestar!

1282
01:28:15,640 --> 01:27:59,640
Father! Father!

1283
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,640
JoJo...

1284
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,640
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

1285
01:28:36,140 --> 01:29:07,140
To die...

1286
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,640
It’s not so bad...

1287
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:47,640
In my son’s arms.

1288
01:29:48,473 --> 01:29:50,140
Father?

1289
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,806
How could this be...

1290
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,640
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1291
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,640
Now he’s dead and there’s
no bringing him back.

1292
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Mr. Joestar...

1293
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1294
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1295
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1296
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
<i>Even though you said you believed me!</i>

1297
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
<i>I couldn’t protect you—
How could I be so powerless?</i>

1298
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>

1299
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
<i>Father, open your eyes!</i>

1300
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
<i>What’s pride worth now?</i>

1301
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>

1302
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body?</i>

1303
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1304
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
<i>Carrying yourself with
discipline and pride</i>

1305
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1306
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>

1307
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1308
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:46,000
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1309
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
<i>It will become the future,
sent up to the stars</i>

1310
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1311
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
<i>Everything is connected,
there’s a meaning to it all</i>

1312
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
<i>I’ll fight against this fate,
keep sorrow at bay</i>

1313
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1314
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1315
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What’s wrong?

1316
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
If that’s the case...

1317
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
The body... Dio’s body is gone!

1318
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
What?!

1319
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,500
What did you say?!

1320
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Oi copper, get away from the window!

1321
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Inspector!

1322
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1323
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1324
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,500
Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!

1325
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Dio!

1326
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Stop!

1327
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Let me...

1328
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:15,875
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!

1329
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:21,125
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads
or tails of what’s happening!

1330
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:26,375
JoJo!

1331
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Can you hear my voice?

1332
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:45,250
H-He’s sucking his blood!

1333
01:33:45,600 --> 01:34:56,799
Let me enjoy this amazing power
for just a little longer!

1334
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
You’re—

1335
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
JoJo...

1336
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I must...

1337
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I’ve gained such incredible power!

1338
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
From the Stone Mask...

1339
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:29,400
I must make my will stronger!

1340
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
From your father’s blood!

1341
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Dio!

1342
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
These monsters are
making <i>more</i> monsters?!

1343
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Mr. Joestar!

1344
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1345
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
That monster is too bloody strong!

1346
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
The brain!

1347
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!

1348
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:51,000
JoJo!

1349
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I’ll have to completely destroy his head!

1350
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:07,750
Speedwagon!

1351
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Stop!

1352
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It’s courage!

1353
01:34:51,000 --> 01:35:12,599
Weak! So weak!

1354
01:34:57,350 --> 01:36:16,049
Don’t run upstairs!

1355
01:35:16,600 --> 01:36:07,799
This fire won’t kill him.

1356
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,400
Mr. Joestar!

1357
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,400
After all, I still don’t know
what I’m capable of yet!

1358
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:04,733
This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!

1359
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
JoJo...

1360
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,400
JoJo!

1361
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,400
Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1362
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,400
I told you, didn’t I?

1363
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,900
No matter how many
tricks you come up with,

1364
01:36:03,049 --> 01:34:52,350
What?

1365
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:08,900
Humans have limits!

1366
01:36:07,666 --> 01:35:36,200
Dio!

1367
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:16,400
Quit hiding behind that
curtain! Come out here!

1368
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:23,400
You and your friend
can become my lifeforce!

1369
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:38,400
Speedwagon, escape from the mansion.

1370
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,400
<i>(The flash of flames,
illuminating the dark)</i>

1371
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:05,150
<i>Come, Dio.</i>

1372
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:08,316
<i>I’m up here.</i>

1373
01:37:08,316 --> 01:37:11,483
<i>Is that an invitation, JoJo?</i>

1374
01:37:11,483 --> 01:37:14,650
<i>Very well, I’ll take care of you first</i>

1375
01:37:14,650 --> 01:37:17,816
<i>(The flash of flames,
scattering the light)</i>

1376
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,400
<i>I’ll put an end to you and
your cursed powers here!</i>

1377
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,799
<i>It’s useless! Useless! Useless!</i>

1378
01:37:25,900 --> 01:36:20,900
<i>It’s time for us to say goodbye to it</i>

1379
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:28,400
<i>I’ll suck you dry!</i>

1380
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,000
<i>(The flames are pulsing)</i>

1381
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,599
<i>JOJO: Father! I’ll mourn you
DIO: I offer you my thanks</i>

1382
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,400
{\an8}<i>(Flickering from light to dark)</i>

1383
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:43,900
<i>JOJO: Please give me strength
DIO: For giving me strength</i>

1384
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:48,900
<i>I always walked in your shadow</i>

1385
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,400
<i>You were always right behind me</i>

1386
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,400
<i>My youth was with you</i>

1387
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,400
<i>The Joestar manor is burning</i>

1388
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,400
<i>And Father is dead!</i>

1389
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:20,400
<i>I’ve lost everything, save for my life</i>

1390
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,400
<i>I’ll let that burn to ash too.
I’ll stop you, Dio!</i>

1391
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,

1392
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,400
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

1393
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,400
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...

1394
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,400
The fire had already engulfed the
mansion, even overtaking the roof.

1395
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

1396
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:33,400
This body is immortal.

1397
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:33,400
The only one dying will be you!

1398
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:45,400
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1399
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:46,900
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1400
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:47,900
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1401
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:48,900
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1402
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,900
-JoJo!

1403
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,400
<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

1404
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,400
The knife you stabbed Father with!

1405
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
It’s useless! I’m immortal!

1406
01:39:59,392 --> 01:40:01,377
<i>With this final bit of strength</i>

1407
01:40:01,377 --> 01:40:03,362
{\an8}<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1408
01:40:03,362 --> 01:40:05,347
{\an8}<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1409
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:11,220
<i>(The goddess of familial love
is flickering in flames)</i>

1410
01:40:21,192 --> 01:40:41,137
<i>(Equally doling out love and judgement)</i>

1411
01:40:41,137 --> 01:41:01,082
<i>This can’t be how my life ends—</i>

1412
01:41:01,082 --> 01:41:21,027
JoJo!!

1413
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Can you hear me?

1414
01:41:33,361 --> 01:41:34,083
You can hear me.

1415
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:34,805
Good.

1416
01:41:34,805 --> 01:41:35,527
I hope you had a nice intermission.

1417
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Can I help you?

1418
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:36,250
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,

1419
01:41:35,807 --> 01:41:35,269
To give him some small
hope to keep on living!

1420
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:36,972
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

1421
01:41:36,346 --> 01:41:35,807
But I want to do what I can at least,

1422
01:41:36,884 --> 01:41:36,346
I’m not much,

1423
01:41:36,972 --> 01:41:37,694
And so that we can continue our
<i>show</i> of love for these characters.

1424
01:41:37,423 --> 01:41:36,884
After carrying the unconscious Mr. Joestar
to the hospital, I came back to visit him!

1425
01:41:37,694 --> 01:41:38,416
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

1426
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:37,423
<i>My voice calling for you?</i>

1427
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:39,138
Just a few more until it’s complete!

1428
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:37,961
<i>JoJo, can you hear me?</i>

1429
01:41:39,038 --> 01:41:38,500
<i>JoJo...</i>

1430
01:41:39,138 --> 01:41:39,861
I hope you get the merch
you’re looking for too.

1431
01:41:39,576 --> 01:41:39,038
<i>JoJo...</i>

1432
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:40,583
Well, let’s continue where we left off.

1433
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I found it!

1434
01:41:40,115 --> 01:41:39,576
<i>JoJo...</i>

1435
01:41:40,346 --> 01:41:47,040
This room doesn’t allow visitors.

1436
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,305
The story up to this point
seems like a bit of a fairytale, but...

1437
01:41:40,653 --> 01:41:40,115
<i>JoJo...</i>

1438
01:41:41,192 --> 01:41:40,653
If I have this mask—

1439
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:42,027
Make no mistake, it’s the truth.

1440
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:41,192
The mask that man wore!

1441
01:41:42,027 --> 01:41:42,750
Things are going to get more
and more bizarre from here on out.

1442
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:43,472
Yes.

1443
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:44,194
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.

1444
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:41,333
Three days later...

1445
01:41:44,194 --> 01:41:44,916
Previously, the mansion was
shrouded in flames and burnt down...

1446
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:45,638
But Mr. Joestar survived.

1447
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
He beat Dio,

1448
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:44,000
But lost everything.

1449
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:53,734
But that’s why I’m here!

1450
01:41:53,734 --> 01:42:00,428
I’m doing enough for him as his nurse.

1451
01:42:00,428 --> 01:42:07,122
Please come back some other day.

1452
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:13,816
Is he alright?! Oi, hold it—

1453
01:42:13,816 --> 01:42:20,510
<i>JoJo...</i>

1454
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:27,204
<i>JoJo...</i>

1455
01:42:27,204 --> 01:42:33,897
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1456
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:40,591
<i>My voice,</i>

1457
01:42:40,591 --> 01:42:47,285
<i>You recognise it, right?</i>

1458
01:42:47,285 --> 01:42:53,979
<i>From that bright, fleeting moment
when we were drawn together</i>

1459
01:42:53,979 --> 01:43:00,673
<i>I want to hear your voice again too</i>

1460
01:43:00,673 --> 01:43:07,367
Where am I...?

1461
01:43:07,367 --> 01:43:14,061
You slept for three whole days!

1462
01:43:14,061 --> 01:43:20,755
The mansion! Everyone is—

1463
01:43:20,755 --> 01:43:27,448
Please, just relax for now!

1464
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:34,142
You’ve made it through the worst
of it, but you’re still in bad shape!

1465
01:43:34,142 --> 01:43:40,836
I’m so glad you’re alive!

1466
01:43:40,836 --> 01:43:47,530
Have you been caring
for me this whole—

1467
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:54,224
You’re—

1468
01:43:54,224 --> 01:44:00,918
No, it couldn’t be.

1469
01:44:00,918 --> 01:44:07,612
But you look like...

1470
01:44:07,612 --> 01:44:14,306
Look like who?

1471
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:21,000
Like Erina Pendleton?

1472
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:27,693
It’s been a while, Jonathan Joestar.

1473
01:44:27,693 --> 01:44:34,387
How?

1474
01:44:34,387 --> 01:44:41,081
This is my father’s hospital.

1475
01:44:41,081 --> 01:44:47,775
We moved to India seven years
ago, and just recently returned.

1476
01:44:47,775 --> 01:44:54,469
It’s really been too long.

1477
01:44:54,469 --> 01:45:01,163
<i>I was weak back then,
I couldn’t run to your side</i>

1478
01:45:01,163 --> 01:45:07,857
<i>I was childish back then,
I couldn’t face you</i>

1479
01:45:07,857 --> 01:45:14,551
<i>Your voice is still the same</i>

1480
01:45:14,551 --> 01:45:21,244
<i>My feelings are still the same</i>

1481
01:45:21,244 --> 01:45:27,938
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

1482
01:45:27,938 --> 01:45:34,632
<i>Erina</i>

1483
01:45:34,632 --> 01:45:41,326
<i>JoJo</i>

1484
01:45:41,326 --> 01:45:48,020
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>

1485
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:54,714
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

1486
01:45:54,714 --> 01:46:01,408
Erina!

1487
01:46:01,408 --> 01:46:08,102
Oh, I’m sorry! I must have
lost my focus and fainted.

1488
01:46:08,102 --> 01:46:14,795
My goodness, you caught
me with your broken arm!

1489
01:46:14,795 --> 01:46:21,489
I’ll always be there to catch you.

1490
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:28,183
<i>When our</i>

1491
01:46:28,183 --> 01:46:34,877
<i>Eyes meet</i>

1492
01:46:34,877 --> 01:46:41,571
<i>I can see it there</i>

1493
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:48,265
<i>That little bit of courage
to move towards tomorrow</i>

1494
01:46:48,265 --> 01:46:54,959
<i>Your hand</i>

1495
01:46:54,959 --> 01:47:01,653
<i>Meets mine</i>

1496
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
<i>I can feel you there</i>

1497
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:12,875
<i>Our fates entwined forever</i>

1498
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:14,791
<i>Now our hearts
resonate, beating as one</i>

1499
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:16,708
<i>Drawn together on that fleeting day</i>

1500
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:18,625
<i>We’ll continue from there</i>

1501
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:20,541
<i>Just the two of us</i>

1502
01:47:20,541 --> 01:47:22,458
Fate? That’s right.

1503
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:24,375
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

1504
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:26,291
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

1505
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:28,208
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1506
01:47:28,208 --> 01:47:30,125
<i>He’s struck again,
that bloodthirsty maniac</i>

1507
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:32,041
<i>It was the same method, another woman—</i>

1508
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:33,958
<i>Her throat was slit</i>

1509
01:47:33,958 --> 01:47:35,875
<i>(And she had her guts ripped out!)</i>

1510
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:37,791
<i>The utmost cruelty!</i>

1511
01:47:37,791 --> 01:47:39,708
<i>No known motive at all!</i>

1512
01:47:39,708 --> 01:47:41,625
<i>The truth of the
matter is out of reach!</i>

1513
01:47:41,625 --> 01:47:43,541
<i>(Like it’s made of fog)</i>

1514
01:47:43,541 --> 01:47:45,458
<i>(Don’t go out walking at night!)</i>

1515
01:47:45,458 --> 01:47:47,375
<i>(You’ll be killed! He’ll find you!)</i>

1516
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:49,291
<i>(The plague of London,
that bloodthirsty killer!)</i>

1517
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:51,208
<i>(Only killing prostitutes,
throwing their guts up on the wall)</i>

1518
01:47:51,208 --> 01:47:53,125
<i>(Only found in fog and
darkness, that’s Jack—)</i>

1519
01:47:53,125 --> 01:47:55,041
<i>Jack the Ripper!</i>

1520
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:56,958
You’re kidding!

1521
01:47:56,958 --> 01:47:58,875
Oh, it’s already so late!

1522
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:00,791
I have to return home soon...

1523
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:02,708
It’s not late at all!

1524
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:04,625
But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!

1525
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,541
It’s a terrifying thought!

1526
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:08,458
Terrifying, is it?

1527
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:10,375
It is!

1528
01:48:10,375 --> 01:48:12,291
Well, as a matter of fact...

1529
01:48:12,291 --> 01:48:14,208
You’re talking with him right now!

1530
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,125
You’re out playing too late,

1531
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:18,041
You dirty harlot!

1532
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Who goes there?

1533
01:48:44,250 --> 01:49:28,750
You...

1534
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I like you.

1535
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Now that you’ve seen me, I’ll—

1536
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
<i>You—</i>

1537
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:10,000
<i>I don’t feel any pain, I’ve
got nothing to fear anymore</i>

1538
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
<i>I’ve been reborn, now’s the
time for my life to start!</i>

1539
01:50:14,166 --> 01:50:42,500
<i>Come to my side, Jack the Ripper!</i>

1540
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,000
<i>Oh, I must heal these wounds,
and for that I’ll need lives!</i>

1541
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
<i>Not to mention a
faithful servant—Jack!</i>

1542
01:50:26,428 --> 01:50:08,142
<i>Break out from the narrow
confines of your prison</i>

1543
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,000
<i>Don’t you want power?</i>

1544
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:40,000
<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1545
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,000
<i>This I will grant you!</i>

1546
01:50:42,500 --> 01:51:10,833
<i>Take my hand!</i>

1547
01:50:44,714 --> 01:50:26,428
<i>I’m not scared of anything!</i>

1548
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,000
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1549
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

1550
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:04,000
They fear that which is spectacularly evil.

1551
01:51:03,000 --> 01:50:44,714
<i>I’ll give you pleasure greater
than you’ve known before</i>

1552
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

1553
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Those are the evil elite.
Like myself, and you as well!

1554
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:22,000
How about it? Will you
become my, Dio’s, companion?

1555
01:51:21,285 --> 01:51:03,000
<i>Jack! You don’t have
to worry anymore</i>

1556
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
What do you know about me?!

1557
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Who’s that?

1558
01:51:24,450 --> 01:51:24,150
What’s wrong?

1559
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:24,450
Eh?

1560
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
<i>Who are you?</i>

1561
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:24,750
Let’s go.

1562
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:25,050
I’m alright.

1563
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:25,350
It’s alright.

1564
01:51:25,950 --> 01:51:25,650
It has to have been.

1565
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:25,950
Yes.

1566
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:26,250
I want to believe it turned
to dust like everything else.

1567
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:26,550
The Stone Mask...

1568
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:26,850
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1569
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:27,150
{\an8}<i>(Blood! Flesh!)</i>

1570
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:27,450
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1571
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
<i>I understand you, Jack.
You’re angry at them, right? </i>

1572
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:27,750
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1573
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:28,050
<i>I don’t need it anymore!</i>

1574
01:51:28,650 --> 01:51:28,350
{\an8}<i>(Blood, flesh, devour it all!)</i>

1575
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:28,650
<i>A life that forsakes the sun!</i>

1576
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:28,950
<i>I’ll start to live from this moment on</i>

1577
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:29,250
<i>We’ll change the tune of
that tired old philosophy!</i>

1578
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:29,550
<i>Seeing stars, or seeing mud?</i>

1579
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
<i>Those women who
indulge in pleasure</i>

1580
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:21,285
{\an8}<i>(Wry! Wry!)</i>

1581
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:46,000
<i>Women who are
dripping with ecstasy</i>

1582
01:51:42,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Has he been here
this whole time?

1583
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:52,000
<i>Go and spill more guts! There’s
no need to be afraid anymore</i>

1584
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Me, afraid?!

1585
01:51:57,857 --> 01:51:39,571
That’s right!

1586
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:07,000
{\an8}<i>(Power and pleasure!)</i>

1587
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:52,500
Jonathan Joestar!

1588
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
<i>I’ll show you the answer,
just come along with me</i>

1589
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:21,500
<i>Hey JoJo, one question at a time!</i>

1590
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
What did you do to me?!

1591
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:24,500
How do you know my name!

1592
01:52:42,875 --> 01:53:18,625
<i>If you do, your fate will change</i>

1593
01:52:52,500 --> 01:53:27,500
And Miss Erina Pendleton.

1594
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Who are you?

1595
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:54,375
<i>Whether you accept that or not</i>

1596
01:53:27,500 --> 01:54:02,500
You’ve done well to survive
the power of the Stone Mask!

1597
01:53:54,375 --> 01:54:30,125
<i>The choice is up to you!</i>

1598
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
The Stone Mask?!

1599
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:28,625
JoJo!

1600
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:31,041
<i>(Pow!)</i>

1601
01:54:31,041 --> 01:54:33,458
<i>Squeeze out</i>

1602
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:35,875
<i>Every last ounce</i>

1603
01:54:35,875 --> 01:54:38,291
<i>Of air inside your lungs!</i>

1604
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:40,708
How could you, he’s injured!

1605
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:43,125
What?! My broken arm—
It doesn’t hurt anymore!

1606
01:54:43,125 --> 01:54:45,541
<i>I am Baron Zeppeli!</i>

1607
01:54:45,541 --> 01:54:47,958
<i>Courage alone won’t defeat
the power of the Stone Mask</i>

1608
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:50,375
<i>I am on your side!</i>

1609
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
What will happen now?

1610
01:54:49,343 --> 01:54:50,030
<i>Let me demonstrate for you</i>

1611
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Dio is alive?!

1612
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:50,716
<i>The power that this breathing awakens!</i>

1613
01:54:50,375 --> 01:54:52,791
<i>I manipulated your breath, your
breath made the pain go away</i>

1614
01:54:50,716 --> 01:54:51,403
<i>(Breathe in, breathe out)</i>

1615
01:54:51,403 --> 01:54:52,090
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1616
01:54:52,090 --> 01:54:52,776
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1617
01:54:52,776 --> 01:54:53,463
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1618
01:54:53,463 --> 01:54:54,150
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1619
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
<i>I am your ally, Jonathan Joestar!</i>

1620
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:54,836
<i>With this special breathing</i>

1621
01:54:54,836 --> 01:54:55,523
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1622
01:54:55,523 --> 01:54:56,210
<i>You carry special oxygen</i>

1623
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:56,896
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1624
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,583
<i>In the blood it sends racing</i>

1625
01:54:57,529 --> 01:55:10,588
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1626
01:54:57,583 --> 01:54:58,269
<i>All throughout your body!</i>

1627
01:54:58,269 --> 01:54:58,956
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

1628
01:54:58,956 --> 01:54:59,643
<i>And energy is born!</i>

1629
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:00,330
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1630
01:55:00,330 --> 01:55:01,016
<i>Its name is—</i>

1631
01:55:01,016 --> 01:55:01,703
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1632
01:55:01,703 --> 01:55:02,389
<i>Ripple Energy!</i>

1633
01:55:02,389 --> 01:55:03,076
<i>(Memetaa!)</i>

1634
01:55:03,076 --> 01:55:03,763
{\an8}[TN: Sound of a frog being punched]

1635
01:55:03,763 --> 01:55:04,450
<i>The ripple’s power
passes through the frog</i>

1636
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:05,136
<i>Making this miracle happen—</i>

1637
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,360
<i>That is the power of the ripple</i>

1638
01:55:09,250 --> 01:54:56,416
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

1639
01:55:10,588 --> 01:55:23,647
<i>We must fight!</i>

1640
01:55:11,575 --> 01:55:20,005
<i>The power this breathing
infuses into your blood!</i>

1641
01:55:20,005 --> 01:55:28,434
<i>(In, out)</i>

1642
01:55:22,083 --> 01:55:09,250
<i>Pursuing the mask</i>

1643
01:55:23,647 --> 01:55:36,705
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1644
01:55:28,434 --> 01:55:36,865
<i>(In, out)</i>

1645
01:55:34,916 --> 01:55:22,083
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

1646
01:55:36,705 --> 01:55:49,764
<i>We must destroy it!</i>

1647
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,400
Breathing?

1648
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:43,400
Everyone has a little bit of energy
flowing through their bloodstream.

1649
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:43,400
It does things like carry nutrients
and regulate your body temperature.

1650
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:43,400
The power of the ripple gathers that small
amount of energy from all over the body.

1651
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:43,400
This is made possible by the rhythm
of a particular breathing technique.

1652
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,760
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!

1653
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:34,916
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

1654
01:55:49,764 --> 01:56:02,823
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1655
01:56:00,583 --> 01:55:47,750
<i>The mask is not broken—he has it!</i>

1656
01:56:02,823 --> 01:56:15,882
<i>And you must wield this
ripple energy, or you will die! </i>

1657
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:00,583
Yes!

1658
01:56:15,882 --> 01:56:28,941
<i>That’s right, your fate,
and the fate of the world</i>

1659
01:56:26,250 --> 01:56:13,416
Dio!

1660
01:56:28,941 --> 01:56:42,000
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

1661
01:56:39,083 --> 01:56:26,250
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

1662
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:55,058
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

1663
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:39,083
<i>They’re two sides of the same coin,
this breathing and the Stone Mask</i>

1664
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,440
And that wave of energy

1665
01:56:55,058 --> 01:57:08,117
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

1666
01:57:04,033 --> 01:57:21,219
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

1667
01:57:04,321 --> 01:56:57,067
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

1668
01:57:04,750 --> 01:56:51,916
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

1669
01:57:08,117 --> 01:57:21,176
<i>I finally found it!</i>

1670
01:57:11,575 --> 01:57:04,321
Use a ripple!

1671
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,640
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

1672
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:04,750
In, out!

1673
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:11,575
I think I’ve got it!

1674
01:57:21,176 --> 01:57:34,235
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

1675
01:57:21,219 --> 01:57:38,406
You see?

1676
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Yes! The power of breathing!

1677
01:57:26,084 --> 01:57:18,830
What must you do to stop that ripple?

1678
01:57:27,483 --> 01:57:43,170
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>

1679
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:26,084
Ah, let’s put it this way.

1680
01:57:34,235 --> 01:57:47,294
<i>Are all tied together. This is—</i>

1681
01:57:40,592 --> 01:57:33,338
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

1682
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:58,856
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>

1683
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
The power to defeat Dio!

1684
01:57:47,294 --> 01:58:00,352
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1685
01:57:47,847 --> 01:57:40,592
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

1686
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:47,847
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

1687
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:29,056
How...?

1688
01:57:58,856 --> 01:58:14,543
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

1689
01:58:00,352 --> 01:58:13,411
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1690
01:58:02,355 --> 01:57:55,101
That turns humans into vampires.

1691
01:58:04,375 --> 01:58:35,125
We’re already out of time.

1692
01:58:09,610 --> 01:58:02,355
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

1693
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:26,470
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1694
01:58:14,543 --> 01:58:30,230
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>

1695
01:58:16,864 --> 01:58:09,610
Mine and Dio’s!

1696
01:58:21,763 --> 01:57:55,410
I swear I’ll come back here again.

1697
01:58:24,118 --> 01:58:16,864
To fight... That is my destiny!

1698
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:45,916
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1699
01:58:31,372 --> 01:58:24,118
<i>Destiny!</i>

1700
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
<i>(In, out!)</i>

1701
01:58:35,125 --> 01:59:05,875
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

1702
01:58:45,916 --> 01:59:01,603
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1703
01:58:48,116 --> 01:58:21,763
For now, please just go along with it!

1704
01:59:01,603 --> 01:59:17,290
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>

1705
01:59:05,875 --> 01:59:36,625
JoJo?

1706
01:59:14,470 --> 01:58:48,116
I can’t get you involved in this!

1707
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:32,976
<i>I am left behind</i>

1708
01:59:32,976 --> 01:59:48,663
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

1709
01:59:40,823 --> 01:59:14,470
Erina...

1710
01:59:48,663 --> 02:00:04,350
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

1711
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
What do you mean, Dio?

1712
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:20,036
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

1713
02:00:20,036 --> 02:00:35,723
<i>I want to scream!</i>

1714
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
JoJo!

1715
02:00:35,723 --> 02:00:51,410
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

1716
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:30,000
<i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>

1717
02:00:51,410 --> 02:01:07,096
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

1718
02:01:06,000 --> 02:00:48,000
<i>So that I can call this
destiny one of love</i>

1719
02:01:07,096 --> 02:01:22,783
<i>Forever guided by fate</i>

1720
02:01:22,783 --> 02:01:38,470
<i>I’ll live my days, spinning its thread</i>

1721
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:06,000
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>

1722
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:54,156
<i>While looking up at the stars</i>

1723
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:24,000
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>

1724
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

1725
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:56,000
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

1726
02:01:59,141 --> 02:02:05,423
<i>Our stars shine together</i>

1727
02:02:00,000 --> 02:01:42,000
<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>

1728
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
<i>Waiting right here</i>

1729
02:02:05,423 --> 02:02:11,705
<i>No matter where you are, I will, I will,</i>

1730
02:02:11,705 --> 02:02:17,988
<i>I will live on!</i>

1731
02:02:17,988 --> 02:02:24,270
<i>I will live on!</i>

1732
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:30,552
<i>I will live on!</i>

1733
02:02:30,552 --> 02:02:36,835
Wang Chan, you’re alive?!

1734
02:02:36,835 --> 02:02:43,117
Yep!

1735
02:02:43,117 --> 02:02:49,400
C’mere!

1736
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:55,682
Why are you so strong?!

1737
02:02:55,682 --> 02:03:01,964
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!

1738
02:03:01,964 --> 02:03:08,247
Speeeedwagon!

1739
02:03:08,247 --> 02:03:14,529
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

1740
02:03:14,529 --> 02:03:20,811
JOJO: Stop right there!

1741
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:27,094
Mr. Joestar!

1742
02:03:27,094 --> 02:03:33,376
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

1743
02:03:33,376 --> 02:03:39,658
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

1744
02:03:39,658 --> 02:03:45,941
Licky licky? Licky licky!

1745
02:03:45,941 --> 02:03:52,223
Licky licky! Licky licky!

1746
02:03:52,223 --> 02:03:58,505
Lickithan Joestar.

1747
02:03:58,505 --> 02:04:04,788
JoJo, be careful.

1748
02:04:04,788 --> 02:04:11,070
He’s strong enough to rival you.

1749
02:04:11,070 --> 02:04:17,352
What was that, you old fart?

1750
02:04:17,352 --> 02:04:23,635
<i>Old fart?</i>

1751
02:04:23,635 --> 02:04:29,917
Time for a taste!

1752
02:04:29,917 --> 02:04:36,200
His arm... got longer!

1753
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:42,482
It’s useless.

1754
02:04:42,482 --> 02:04:48,764
I’ve been given new life!

1755
02:04:48,764 --> 02:04:55,047
And a body that transcends humanit—

1756
02:04:55,047 --> 02:05:01,329
That’s not what’s important here.

1757
02:05:01,329 --> 02:05:07,611
M-My body...

1758
02:05:07,611 --> 02:05:13,894
It’s hot!

1759
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,500
But it’s the same power!

1760
02:05:13,894 --> 02:05:20,176
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!

1761
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:14,350
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!

1762
02:05:19,277 --> 02:05:28,831
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:

1763
02:05:19,350 --> 02:05:16,850
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

1764
02:05:20,176 --> 02:05:26,458
Ah! Wait!

1765
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:19,350
That’s why I wanted power.

1766
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:21,850
I lost so much...

1767
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:24,350
What’s wrong, JoJo?

1768
02:05:28,831 --> 02:05:38,385
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”

1769
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:26,850
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.

1770
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,600
It’s amazing!

1771
02:05:38,385 --> 02:05:47,939
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,

1772
02:05:47,939 --> 02:05:57,493
They became vikings with backbone!

1773
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
What was that?!

1774
02:05:57,493 --> 02:06:07,047
You are different from Dio and his ilk!

1775
02:06:03,214 --> 02:06:18,443
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>

1776
02:06:07,047 --> 02:06:16,601
Because you feel the pain.

1777
02:06:16,601 --> 02:06:26,155
Pain...

1778
02:06:18,443 --> 02:06:33,673
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>

1779
02:06:26,155 --> 02:06:35,709
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>

1780
02:06:33,673 --> 02:06:48,902
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>

1781
02:06:35,709 --> 02:06:45,263
<i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>

1782
02:06:45,263 --> 02:06:54,817
<i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>

1783
02:06:48,902 --> 02:07:04,131
<i>The mask burst with light</i>

1784
02:06:54,817 --> 02:07:04,371
<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

1785
02:07:04,131 --> 02:07:19,360
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>

1786
02:07:04,371 --> 02:07:13,925
You need to listen to that pain!

1787
02:07:10,410 --> 02:06:19,203
I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

1788
02:07:13,925 --> 02:07:23,479
<i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>

1789
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:34,590
Mr. Zeppeli!

1790
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,420
JoJo!

1791
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:33,033
<i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>

1792
02:07:33,033 --> 02:07:42,587
<i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>

1793
02:07:34,149 --> 02:07:55,607
Hey JoJo.

1794
02:07:34,590 --> 02:07:49,819
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>

1795
02:07:42,587 --> 02:07:52,141
<i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>

1796
02:07:47,234 --> 02:07:30,931
And the resolve to face the consequences.

1797
02:07:49,819 --> 02:08:05,048
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>

1798
02:07:52,141 --> 02:08:01,695
<i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>

1799
02:07:55,607 --> 02:08:17,065
JoJo JoJo JoJo.

1800
02:08:01,616 --> 02:07:10,410
It was pure coincidence!

1801
02:08:01,695 --> 02:08:11,249
<i>Staining the darkness red</i>

1802
02:08:03,537 --> 02:07:47,234
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!

1803
02:08:05,048 --> 02:08:20,277
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>

1804
02:08:11,249 --> 02:08:20,803
<i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>

1805
02:08:17,065 --> 02:08:38,523
Ha-hey JoJo.

1806
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:03,537
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>

1807
02:08:20,277 --> 02:08:35,506
It was my father!

1808
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,220
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1809
02:08:35,506 --> 02:08:50,736
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>

1810
02:08:36,142 --> 02:08:19,840
<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be
JOJO: Shining bright</i>

1811
02:08:38,523 --> 02:08:59,981
Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.

1812
02:08:50,736 --> 02:09:05,965
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>

1813
02:08:52,445 --> 02:08:36,142
<i>ZEP: I swore to take revenge
JOJO: I won’t let you down!</i>

1814
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:21,439
Don’t forget this goal.

1815
02:09:08,748 --> 02:08:52,445
<i>ZEP: I’ve been chasing after it
JOJO: So that it won’t repeat</i>

1816
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:16,900
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

1817
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:42,897
Yes, sir.

1818
02:09:42,897 --> 02:10:04,355
I believe in the power of the ripple.

1819
02:10:04,355 --> 02:10:25,813
Yep.

1820
02:10:25,813 --> 02:10:47,271
I like your fringe.

1821
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
What is he...

1822
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
JoJo!

1823
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Hey JoJo, JoJo!

1824
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:21,000
He’s inside the horse’s body!

1825
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Why, why?!

1826
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Jonathan Joestar!

1827
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

1828
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Are you angry?

1829
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
You’re good company, huh?

1830
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Give me a little taste of your fresh blood!

1831
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Oh! It burns! It burns!

1832
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
My body, it—

1833
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Mr. Joestar!

1834
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Is that Mr. Horse?

1835
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Look Wang Chan!
Your, your ancestors—

1836
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Clippity clop, clippity clop!

1837
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
There he is.

1838
02:11:58,117 --> 02:12:08,352
Stand down, you two.

1839
02:11:59,151 --> 02:11:59,454
<i>The lovable sweetheart, Mr. Joestar,
has finally got a handle on the ripple</i>

1840
02:11:59,454 --> 02:11:59,757
<i>Hey yo yo! We’re coming
to collect payment</i>

1841
02:11:59,757 --> 02:12:00,060
<i>These bills been piling piling up</i>

1842
02:12:00,060 --> 02:12:00,363
<i>Your underworld rep, AKA
Speedwagon, is here to give a full report</i>

1843
02:12:00,363 --> 02:12:00,666
<i>Who else would be your guide</i>

1844
02:12:00,666 --> 02:12:00,969
<i>To this 16 bar showtime?</i>

1845
02:12:00,969 --> 02:12:01,272
<i>South of London, in total daylight,</i>

1846
02:12:01,272 --> 02:12:01,575
<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

1847
02:12:01,575 --> 02:12:01,878
<i>When we pass through this
tunnel, you’ll see the sights</i>

1848
02:12:01,878 --> 02:12:02,181
<i>That famous city of knights</i>

1849
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:02,484
<i>This is Windknight’s Lot</i>

1850
02:12:02,484 --> 02:12:02,787
<i>A natural fortress like an augite rock</i>

1851
02:12:02,787 --> 02:12:03,090
<i>Windknight’s Lot</i>

1852
02:12:03,090 --> 02:12:03,393
<i>Fate’ll have it—Dio’s hideout</i>

1853
02:12:03,393 --> 02:12:03,696
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1854
02:12:03,696 --> 02:12:04,000
<i>We’ll knock it out</i>

1855
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:04,303
<i>While the sun’s out</i>

1856
02:12:04,303 --> 02:12:04,606
<i>Clean this vampire nest out</i>

1857
02:12:04,606 --> 02:12:04,909
<i>Ay, Dio, dick, you make me sick</i>

1858
02:12:04,909 --> 02:12:05,212
<i>You play with life, that’s bullshit!</i>

1859
02:12:05,212 --> 02:12:05,515
<i>No more tomorrows Dio, that’s it</i>

1860
02:12:05,515 --> 02:12:05,818
<i>Now’s the end, ya gonna get hit!</i>

1861
02:12:05,818 --> 02:12:06,121
Thanks for keeping watch, Speedwagon.

1862
02:12:06,121 --> 02:12:06,424
My underground sources say that
Wang Chan definitely fled here.

1863
02:12:06,424 --> 02:12:06,727
Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

1864
02:12:06,727 --> 02:12:07,030
It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.

1865
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,333
The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

1866
02:12:07,333 --> 02:12:07,636
Yes, we’re arriving according to plan.

1867
02:12:07,636 --> 02:12:07,939
Oi, driver, why are we stopped here?

1868
02:12:07,939 --> 02:12:08,242
Whaaat?!

1869
02:12:08,242 --> 02:12:08,545
Be careful! The sun doesn’t reach here.

1870
02:12:08,352 --> 02:12:18,588
I will fight!

1871
02:12:08,545 --> 02:12:08,848
L-Look!

1872
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
T-The horse!!

1873
02:12:18,588 --> 02:12:28,823
JoJo, here’s a battle lesson!

1874
02:12:28,823 --> 02:12:39,058
You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

1875
02:12:39,058 --> 02:12:49,294
They come after us humans
even though we’re giants to them.

1876
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Windknight’s Lot...

1877
02:12:49,294 --> 02:12:59,529
Could you call something
like that “courageous”?

1878
02:12:50,619 --> 02:12:57,858
I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.

1879
02:12:57,858 --> 02:13:05,097
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

1880
02:12:59,529 --> 02:13:09,764
What are you yammering on about!

1881
02:13:05,097 --> 02:13:12,336
They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

1882
02:13:09,764 --> 02:13:20,000
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

1883
02:13:12,336 --> 02:13:19,576
Yes. Dio’s surely at the end of the trail.

1884
02:13:19,576 --> 02:13:26,815
Can you hear me?

1885
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:30,235
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

1886
02:13:26,815 --> 02:13:34,054
Sleeping knights...

1887
02:13:30,235 --> 02:13:40,470
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

1888
02:13:34,054 --> 02:13:41,293
<i>Follow me, serve royalty once again</i>

1889
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:50,705
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!

1890
02:13:41,293 --> 02:13:48,532
<i>Get your revenge on the past,
let’s rewrite history</i>

1891
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:04,000
There’s a hidden passage in the tunnel!

1892
02:13:48,532 --> 02:13:55,771
<i>Upend righteousness,
go for total victory</i>

1893
02:13:50,705 --> 02:14:00,941
The hymn of humanity
is a song of courage!

1894
02:13:55,771 --> 02:14:03,010
<i>That’s this world, the
unwavering world of Dio</i>

1895
02:14:00,941 --> 02:14:11,176
The greatness of humanity
is the greatness of courage!

1896
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:10,250
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1897
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:17,489
<i>Your long silence has
left this world to rot</i>

1898
02:14:11,176 --> 02:14:21,411
These zombies, no matter how
strong, know nothing of courage!

1899
02:14:17,489 --> 02:14:24,728
<i>Now raise your voices,
from crushed throats</i>

1900
02:14:21,411 --> 02:14:31,647
They’re just like fleas!

1901
02:14:24,728 --> 02:14:31,967
<i>Crying out from the mud,
conquer the stars</i>

1902
02:14:28,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Yes... I’ll eat every
shred of you in one bite!

1903
02:14:31,647 --> 02:14:41,882
Hot, so hot!

1904
02:14:31,967 --> 02:14:39,206
<i>I’ll allow you this and more!</i>

1905
02:14:39,206 --> 02:14:46,445
<i>(My sword, it’s yours!)</i>

1906
02:14:46,445 --> 02:14:53,684
<i>(Now is the time to raise our voices)</i>

1907
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
How dare you! I’ll kill you!

1908
02:14:53,684 --> 02:15:00,923
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1909
02:15:00,923 --> 02:15:08,163
<i>(We’ve been sleeping for 300 years,
us rotten and forgotten corpses)</i>

1910
02:15:08,163 --> 02:15:15,402
{\an8}<i>Wrrryyy!</i>

1911
02:15:15,402 --> 02:15:22,641
<i>Get your revenge!</i>

1912
02:15:22,641 --> 02:15:29,880
<i>300 years asleep, haunted
by painful thoughts</i>

1913
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:37,119
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1914
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:44,358
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1915
02:15:44,358 --> 02:15:51,597
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1916
02:15:51,597 --> 02:15:58,836
Wait, Dio!

1917
02:15:58,836 --> 02:16:06,076
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1918
02:16:06,076 --> 02:16:13,315
Come quick, JoJo.

1919
02:16:13,315 --> 02:16:20,554
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1920
02:16:20,554 --> 02:16:27,793
My world is in the palm of my hand now!

1921
02:16:27,793 --> 02:16:35,032
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry!)</i>

1922
02:16:35,032 --> 02:16:42,271
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1923
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
It’s really melting away...

1924
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:40,500
So much that there’s a hole in my cheek...

1925
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,500
My tongue is sticking out of the hole!

1926
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:42,500
Your cheek is melting,

1927
02:16:42,271 --> 02:16:49,510
<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1928
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,500
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?

1929
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:44,500
Dio!

1930
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Oh, it really is.

1931
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:56,750
<i>I will dominate life at last,</i>

1932
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:41,250
It’s melting...

1933
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

1934
02:16:54,818 --> 02:17:08,456
The sun has set.

1935
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:53,166
<i>Wry wry!</i>

1936
02:16:56,750 --> 02:17:03,989
<i>Tearing its natural
order from God’s grasp</i>

1937
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
<i>My world, this world!</i>

1938
02:16:57,833 --> 02:16:55,500
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to destroy!)</i>

1939
02:17:03,989 --> 02:17:11,228
<i>I will dominate history too,</i>

1940
02:17:08,456 --> 02:17:22,093
It’s time for your lives
to go down with it!

1941
02:17:11,228 --> 02:17:18,467
<i>Rewriting and upending it anew</i>

1942
02:17:18,467 --> 02:17:25,706
<i>I will dominate even time,</i>

1943
02:17:22,093 --> 02:17:35,731
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!

1944
02:17:25,706 --> 02:17:32,945
<i>My body eternal and sublime</i>

1945
02:17:32,945 --> 02:17:40,184
{\an8}<i>(Eternal life!)</i>

1946
02:17:35,731 --> 02:17:49,368
Even so, I can’t help
this feeling of dread.

1947
02:17:40,184 --> 02:17:47,423
<i>I will dominate everything,
rise above all my cares</i>

1948
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:11,833
{\an8}<i>(Wry wry, we vow to kill!)</i>

1949
02:17:47,423 --> 02:17:54,663
{\an8}<i>(We vow to steal them away!)</i>

1950
02:17:49,368 --> 02:18:03,006
As a human, I can’t let
you get away with this!

1951
02:17:54,663 --> 02:18:01,902
<i>Win it all, negate righteousness</i>

1952
02:18:01,902 --> 02:18:09,141
<i>In this peacefully unaware country</i>

1953
02:18:03,006 --> 02:18:16,643
JoJo!

1954
02:18:09,141 --> 02:18:16,380
{\an8}<i>(This country is ours!)</i>

1955
02:18:11,166 --> 02:17:41,500
<i>And demand peace of mind!</i>

1956
02:18:16,643 --> 02:18:30,281
Put your training to use.

1957
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
<i>I will dominate everything,
I’ll face them now</i>

1958
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:43,918
<i>(We’ll feast! On your blood and flesh!)</i>

1959
02:18:43,918 --> 02:18:57,556
<i>(Steal it away!)</i>

1960
02:18:57,556 --> 02:19:11,193
<i>(To heal all of our wounds!)</i>

1961
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Dio Brando?

1962
02:19:11,193 --> 02:19:24,831
<i>JoJo, here’s a lesson for you</i>

1963
02:19:12,657 --> 02:19:11,552
This is the power
that will defeat you!

1964
02:19:13,763 --> 02:19:12,657
The ripple of the sun! Dio!

1965
02:19:14,868 --> 02:19:13,763
<i>Overdrive!!</i>

1966
02:19:15,973 --> 02:19:14,868
<i>Sunlight yellow, sunlight yellow</i>

1967
02:19:17,078 --> 02:19:15,973
<i>(Over!)</i>

1968
02:19:18,184 --> 02:19:17,078
<i>Over...</i>

1969
02:19:19,289 --> 02:19:18,184
<i>(Yellow...)</i>

1970
02:19:20,394 --> 02:19:19,289
<i>Yellow...</i>

1971
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:20,394
<i>(Sunlight...)</i>

1972
02:19:22,605 --> 02:19:21,500
<i>Sunlight...</i>

1973
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:22,605
{\an8}<i>(Heat!)</i>

1974
02:19:24,815 --> 02:19:23,710
<i>Pa-pow-pow-pow with unrelenting heat!</i>

1975
02:19:24,831 --> 02:19:38,468
<i>The north wind made the vikings!</i>

1976
02:19:25,921 --> 02:19:24,815
<i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>

1977
02:19:27,026 --> 02:19:25,921
<i>Find your way through the darkness!</i>

1978
02:19:28,131 --> 02:19:27,026
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>

1979
02:19:29,236 --> 02:19:28,131
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1980
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
<i>The waves of the ripple!</i>

1981
02:19:30,342 --> 02:19:29,236
<i>Are resounding through my body!</i>

1982
02:19:31,447 --> 02:19:30,342
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1983
02:19:35,841 --> 02:19:31,947
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my
way through the darkness!</i>

1984
02:19:38,468 --> 02:19:52,106
This battle will be an exercise—

1985
02:19:39,735 --> 02:19:35,841
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

1986
02:19:43,629 --> 02:19:39,735
<i>The ripple of the wine!</i>

1987
02:19:47,523 --> 02:19:43,629
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

1988
02:19:51,417 --> 02:19:47,523
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>

1989
02:19:52,106 --> 02:20:05,743
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!

1990
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:51,417
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>

1991
02:19:59,205 --> 02:19:55,311
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1992
02:19:59,300 --> 02:21:25,900
Yeah?

1993
02:20:03,100 --> 02:19:59,205
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

1994
02:20:05,743 --> 02:20:19,381
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!

1995
02:20:06,994 --> 02:20:03,100
<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>

1996
02:20:10,888 --> 02:20:06,994
<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>

1997
02:20:14,782 --> 02:20:10,888
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

1998
02:20:18,676 --> 02:20:14,782
<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>

1999
02:20:22,570 --> 02:20:18,676
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

2000
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:36,200
The north wind made the vikings!

2001
02:20:26,464 --> 02:20:22,570
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>

2002
02:20:30,358 --> 02:20:26,464
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>

2003
02:20:34,252 --> 02:20:30,358
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—

2004
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
I don’t know you, but...

2005
02:22:11,430 --> 02:22:11,892
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:

2006
02:22:11,892 --> 02:22:12,353
Finally, we meet.

2007
02:22:12,353 --> 02:22:12,815
Don’t get carried away!

2008
02:22:12,815 --> 02:22:13,276
Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.

2009
02:22:13,276 --> 02:22:13,738
You’re the one who put it there!

2010
02:22:13,738 --> 02:22:14,200
Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.

2011
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:14,661
I’ll be using your lives...

2012
02:22:14,661 --> 02:22:15,123
To purge this wound!

2013
02:22:15,123 --> 02:22:15,584
You bastard!

2014
02:22:15,584 --> 02:22:16,046
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?

2015
02:22:16,046 --> 02:22:16,507
Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?

2016
02:22:16,507 --> 02:22:16,969
I’ll make you submit!

2017
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
By the ripple of the sun!

2018
02:22:20,533 --> 02:22:23,200
Pow!

2019
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:25,866
Utterly pathetic!

2020
02:22:25,866 --> 02:22:28,533
It’s freezing?!

2021
02:22:28,533 --> 02:22:31,200
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!

2022
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,866
I am able to control my own body at will.

2023
02:22:33,866 --> 02:22:36,533
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2024
02:22:36,533 --> 02:22:39,200
Then you won’t be able to use that power!

2025
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,866
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2026
02:22:41,866 --> 02:22:44,533
Mr. Zeppeli!

2027
02:22:44,533 --> 02:22:47,200
Useless, useless, useless, useless!

2028
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:49,866
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2029
02:22:49,866 --> 02:22:52,533
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,

2030
02:22:52,533 --> 02:22:55,200
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2031
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,866
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.

2032
02:22:57,866 --> 02:23:00,533
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...

2033
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,200
JoJo, Dio!

2034
02:23:00,533 --> 02:23:03,200
That’s right. Do you remember?

2035
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,866
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?

2036
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,200
What?

2037
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:54,000
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,

2038
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:41,740
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2039
02:23:41,740 --> 02:24:04,100
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2040
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:29,200
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2041
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:26,460
Mary Stuart!

2042
02:24:24,450 --> 02:23:26,950
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

2043
02:24:26,460 --> 02:24:48,820
It was about the ones who served her!

2044
02:24:29,200 --> 02:25:04,400
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—

2045
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Yes!

2046
02:24:59,550 --> 02:24:54,650
Father told us...

2047
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of those two proud knights...

2048
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
This is a story of knightly pride!

2049
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:26,894
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

2050
02:25:26,894 --> 02:25:28,157
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2051
02:25:28,157 --> 02:25:29,421
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>

2052
02:25:29,421 --> 02:25:30,684
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2053
02:25:30,684 --> 02:25:31,947
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>

2054
02:25:31,947 --> 02:25:33,210
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>

2055
02:25:33,210 --> 02:25:34,473
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2056
02:25:34,473 --> 02:25:35,736
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>

2057
02:25:35,736 --> 02:25:37,000
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>

2058
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,263
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2059
02:25:38,263 --> 02:25:39,526
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>

2060
02:25:39,526 --> 02:25:40,789
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2061
02:25:40,789 --> 02:25:42,052
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,

2062
02:25:42,052 --> 02:25:43,315
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2063
02:25:43,315 --> 02:25:44,578
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

2064
02:25:44,578 --> 02:25:45,842
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>

2065
02:25:45,842 --> 02:25:47,105
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>

2066
02:25:47,105 --> 02:25:48,368
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2067
02:25:48,368 --> 02:25:49,631
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2068
02:25:49,631 --> 02:25:50,894
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2069
02:25:50,894 --> 02:25:52,157
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2070
02:25:52,157 --> 02:25:53,421
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2071
02:25:53,421 --> 02:25:54,684
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2072
02:25:54,684 --> 02:25:55,947
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2073
02:25:55,947 --> 02:25:57,210
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!

2074
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:58,473
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2075
02:25:58,473 --> 02:25:59,736
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2076
02:25:59,736 --> 02:26:01,000
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2077
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,263
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2078
02:26:02,263 --> 02:26:03,526
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2079
02:26:03,526 --> 02:26:04,789
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2080
02:26:04,789 --> 02:26:06,052
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2081
02:26:06,052 --> 02:26:07,315
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>

2082
02:26:07,315 --> 02:26:08,578
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2083
02:26:08,578 --> 02:26:09,842
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2084
02:26:09,842 --> 02:26:11,105
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2085
02:26:11,105 --> 02:26:12,368
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2086
02:26:12,368 --> 02:26:13,631
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2087
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:14,894
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2088
02:26:14,894 --> 02:26:16,157
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!

2089
02:26:16,157 --> 02:26:17,421
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2090
02:26:17,421 --> 02:26:18,684
But those two should
have done a better job!

2091
02:26:18,684 --> 02:26:19,947
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2092
02:26:19,947 --> 02:26:21,210
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2093
02:26:21,210 --> 02:26:22,473
It might be as you say, however—

2094
02:26:22,473 --> 02:26:23,736
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2095
02:26:23,736 --> 02:26:25,000
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2096
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,263
Everything is connected!

2097
02:26:26,263 --> 02:26:27,526
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2098
02:26:27,526 --> 02:26:28,789
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2099
02:26:28,789 --> 02:26:30,052
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2100
02:26:30,052 --> 02:26:31,315
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2101
02:26:31,315 --> 02:26:32,578
<i>Either one—</i>

2102
02:26:32,578 --> 02:26:33,842
<i>JoJo</i>

2103
02:26:33,842 --> 02:26:35,105
<i>Dio</i>

2104
02:26:35,105 --> 02:26:36,368
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2105
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I turned those two

2106
02:26:48,669 --> 02:27:08,007
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!

2107
02:27:08,007 --> 02:27:27,345
Even history bends before me!

2108
02:27:27,345 --> 02:27:46,684
It can’t be!

2109
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The way you feel—

2110
02:27:46,684 --> 02:28:06,022
Such grotesque forms!

2111
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
My master—I, Bruford,

2112
02:27:54,005 --> 02:28:28,015
Your pride, your resentment.

2113
02:28:06,022 --> 02:28:25,360
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2114
02:28:08,255 --> 02:28:36,765
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2115
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:44,699
Don’t you think so?

2116
02:28:28,015 --> 02:29:02,025
I can’t even imagine it!

2117
02:28:36,765 --> 02:29:05,275
Alright, go ahead!

2118
02:28:44,699 --> 02:29:04,037
Kill them all!

2119
02:29:02,025 --> 02:29:36,035
But I also bear my own burdens!

2120
02:29:04,037 --> 02:29:23,375
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2121
02:29:05,275 --> 02:29:33,785
We’ll duel as knights!

2122
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Honourable knight,

2123
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:09,400
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2124
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:10,200
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2125
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2126
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:11,000
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2127
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:11,800
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2128
02:29:23,003 --> 02:29:47,010
Is revenge your answer?

2129
02:29:23,375 --> 02:29:42,714
Tarkus!

2130
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And you, Tarkus!

2131
02:29:33,785 --> 02:30:02,295
Run away, you two!

2132
02:29:36,035 --> 02:30:10,045
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2133
02:29:42,714 --> 02:30:02,052
Bruford!

2134
02:29:47,010 --> 02:30:11,016
Is that what you take pride in?

2135
02:30:02,052 --> 02:30:21,390
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2136
02:30:02,295 --> 02:30:30,805
Mr. Joestar!

2137
02:30:02,529 --> 02:29:42,176
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2138
02:30:10,045 --> 02:30:44,055
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2139
02:30:11,016 --> 02:30:35,023
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2140
02:30:15,045 --> 02:28:39,015
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2141
02:30:18,545 --> 02:29:33,515
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2142
02:30:22,883 --> 02:30:02,529
Our pride!

2143
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
Our grudge!

2144
02:30:35,023 --> 02:30:59,029
You can lecture me after you win!

2145
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,060
Fucking hell!

2146
02:30:40,774 --> 02:30:39,631
Damn it...

2147
02:30:41,917 --> 02:30:40,774
Don’t come any closer!

2148
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:41,917
Old man!

2149
02:30:44,202 --> 02:30:43,060
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2150
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
Tarkus!

2151
02:30:45,345 --> 02:30:44,202
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2152
02:30:46,488 --> 02:30:45,345
I won’t let you interfere!

2153
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2154
02:30:59,029 --> 02:31:23,036
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2155
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:03,060
That man’s pride...

2156
02:31:23,036 --> 02:31:47,043
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2157
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,060
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2158
02:31:47,043 --> 02:32:11,050
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2159
02:31:55,060 --> 02:32:15,060
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2160
02:32:02,859 --> 02:31:49,660
Speedwagon...

2161
02:32:11,050 --> 02:32:35,056
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

2162
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:35,060
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2163
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:02,859
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2164
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Luck!

2165
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:29,060
And also...

2166
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
Pluck!

2167
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:16,060
Melt!

2168
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:55,060
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

2169
02:32:42,460 --> 02:32:29,260
Old man!

2170
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2171
02:32:50,127 --> 02:33:28,261
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

2172
02:32:55,060 --> 02:33:15,060
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2173
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
What the...

2174
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,060
Why aren’t you moving?

2175
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,060
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2176
02:33:28,261 --> 02:34:06,395
Damn you!

2177
02:33:36,060 --> 02:31:50,060
Let it somehow be restored!

2178
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,060
This pain means nothing to me!

2179
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:57,060
JoJo!

2180
02:33:43,560 --> 02:34:28,560
Just now,

2181
02:33:57,060 --> 02:34:17,060
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2182
02:34:06,395 --> 02:34:44,529
JoJo!

2183
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
No!

2184
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2185
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,060
Bruford...

2186
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Pain?

2187
02:34:44,529 --> 02:35:22,664
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

2188
02:34:45,795 --> 02:34:55,265
That’s why...

2189
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You said “pain”.

2190
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,060
That means that now,

2191
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:55,060
You can feel pain!

2192
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Pain...

2193
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I stopped fighting you.

2194
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That’s why you stopped your sword.

2195
02:35:07,045 --> 02:36:59,015
How could you!

2196
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a great knight.

2197
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is proof of life!

2198
02:35:22,664 --> 02:36:00,798
Just as I thought...

2199
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You are human!

2200
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:31,250
So this is what it means to be human?

2201
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

2202
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

2203
02:35:51,015 --> 02:34:43,045
JoJo!

2204
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

2205
02:36:00,765 --> 02:34:02,295
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

2206
02:36:00,798 --> 02:36:38,932
I, Dio, will—

2207
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
What did he have to be joyful about!

2208
02:36:39,625 --> 02:36:27,875
He never got his revenge!

2209
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You are my hope.

2210
02:36:51,375 --> 02:36:39,625
What an embarrassment of a knight!

2211
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Hey baby!

2212
02:37:03,125 --> 02:36:51,375
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

2213
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

2214
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:02,666
JoJo,

2215
02:37:53,333 --> 02:37:28,000
I leave everything I have to you.

2216
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
For victory!

2217
02:38:00,150 --> 02:38:04,450
I take pride in victory!

2218
02:38:04,450 --> 02:38:08,750
Fuck!

2219
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:13,050
I’ll get you!

2220
02:38:13,050 --> 02:38:17,350
I’ll get you for this!

2221
02:38:17,350 --> 02:38:21,650
JoJo...

2222
02:38:18,666 --> 02:37:53,333
In the end,

2223
02:38:21,650 --> 02:38:25,950
JoJo!

2224
02:38:25,950 --> 02:38:30,250
My final ripple...

2225
02:38:30,250 --> 02:38:34,550
My... dying wish is...

2226
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:38,850
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

2227
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
He collapsed.

2228
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:18,666
I lived my own life to the fullest.

2229
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

2230
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

2231
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Old man!

2232
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Mr. Zeppeli!

2233
02:39:09,333 --> 02:38:44,000
I...

2234
02:39:10,375 --> 02:39:13,125
If we lose you—

2235
02:39:13,125 --> 02:39:15,875
There’s no time to be sad.

2236
02:39:15,875 --> 02:39:18,625
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

2237
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Old man!

2238
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

2239
02:40:10,166 --> 02:40:14,500
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

2240
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:18,833
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

2241
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:32,000
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

2242
02:40:33,500 --> 02:40:36,500
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

2243
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:39,500
<i>Into my spirit</i>

2244
02:40:39,500 --> 02:40:42,500
It felt like...

2245
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.

2246
02:40:53,125 --> 02:40:55,375
From here on...

2247
02:40:55,375 --> 02:40:57,625
I live within you.

2248
02:40:57,625 --> 02:40:59,875
JoJo.

2249
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
<i>The way to you...</i>

2250
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:14,000
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2251
02:41:15,125 --> 02:41:17,375
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

2252
02:41:17,375 --> 02:41:19,625
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

2253
02:41:19,625 --> 02:41:21,875
<i>Even this pain...</i>

2254
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:05,800
<i>Will light up</i>

2255
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:29,000
<i>Even this pain</i>

2256
02:41:23,500 --> 02:42:10,500
Dio!

2257
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:42,000
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

2258
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:21,400
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

2259
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:51,000
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

2260
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:37,000
<i>A golden spirit</i>

2261
02:41:53,833 --> 02:41:59,500
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

2262
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:05,166
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

2263
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:16,000
<i>And from this prison...</i>

2264
02:42:08,200 --> 02:41:52,600
<i>I see the stars</i>

2265
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:43,000
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

2266
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:50,000
JoJo...!

2267
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,000
<i>Dio...</i>

2268
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:33,000
<i>Dio...</i>

2269
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:41,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

2270
02:43:41,125 --> 02:43:41,375
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

2271
02:43:41,375 --> 02:43:41,625
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

2272
02:43:41,625 --> 02:43:41,875
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2273
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:50,000
<i>I already killed my past</i>

2274
02:43:50,250 --> 02:43:50,750
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

2275
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:59,000
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

2276
02:44:00,741 --> 02:44:04,224
<i>You and I are different</i>

2277
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:07,706
<i>We’re not so different, you’re my son</i>

2278
02:44:07,706 --> 02:44:11,189
<i>I have changed into something new</i>

2279
02:44:11,189 --> 02:44:14,672
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

2280
02:44:14,672 --> 02:44:18,155
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

2281
02:44:18,155 --> 02:44:21,637
<i>DIO: I’ll steal it all
DARIO: You’ll steal it all</i>

2282
02:44:21,637 --> 02:44:25,120
<i>DIO: Upend righteousness</i>

2283
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:28,603
<i>DARIO: You’re my clever boy!</i>

2284
02:44:28,603 --> 02:44:32,086
<i>DIO: I will conquer it all</i>

2285
02:44:32,086 --> 02:44:35,568
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

2286
02:44:35,568 --> 02:44:39,051
<i>DIO: I will dominate everything</i>

2287
02:44:39,051 --> 02:44:42,534
<i>Go ahead and dominate,
what will you want after that?</i>

2288
02:44:42,534 --> 02:44:46,017
<i>What do I want?</i>

2289
02:44:46,017 --> 02:44:49,500
<i>DARIO: What do you want?</i>

2290
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:52,982
<i>DIO: What do I want?</i>

2291
02:44:52,982 --> 02:44:56,465
<i>I want...</i>

2292
02:44:56,465 --> 02:44:59,948
<i>I want...</i>

2293
02:44:59,948 --> 02:45:03,431
{\an8}<i>Dio... Dio...</i>

2294
02:45:03,431 --> 02:45:06,913
<i>I want...</i>

2295
02:45:06,913 --> 02:45:10,396
So you’ve come...

2296
02:45:10,396 --> 02:45:13,879
JoJo.

2297
02:45:13,879 --> 02:45:17,362
Is this...

2298
02:45:17,362 --> 02:45:20,844
The world you wished for?

2299
02:45:20,844 --> 02:45:24,327
What?

2300
02:45:24,327 --> 02:45:27,810
The world...

2301
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:31,293
That you’ve been trying
to obtain for so long...

2302
02:45:31,293 --> 02:45:34,775
Surrounded by death...

2303
02:45:34,775 --> 02:45:38,258
It’s a pitiful world, isn’t it?

2304
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
It’s a splendid world where
I’ve dominated everything.

2305
02:45:51,333 --> 02:45:54,000
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

2306
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,666
For that reason, you stole
from uninvolved innocents?

2307
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:03,000
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

2308
02:46:04,833 --> 02:46:08,500
You’re just afraid.

2309
02:46:08,500 --> 02:46:12,166
Of being human...

2310
02:46:12,166 --> 02:46:15,833
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

2311
02:46:15,833 --> 02:46:19,500
For the sake of obtaining this world...

2312
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:23,166
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

2313
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
You ran away from it.

2314
02:46:29,136 --> 02:46:33,409
The ends justify the means.

2315
02:46:33,409 --> 02:46:37,681
I will win,

2316
02:46:37,681 --> 02:46:41,954
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

2317
02:46:41,954 --> 02:46:46,227
All of this is fate!

2318
02:46:46,227 --> 02:46:50,500
No!

2319
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:54,772
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

2320
02:46:54,772 --> 02:46:59,045
Opposing fate...

2321
02:46:59,045 --> 02:47:03,318
What will your legacy be?

2322
02:47:03,318 --> 02:47:07,590
Such righteousness!

2323
02:47:07,590 --> 02:47:11,863
Just like the one who gave me this power...

2324
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And then died!

2325
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Just like...

2326
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Your father.

2327
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
That’s right.

2328
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

2329
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

2330
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
For the sake of revenge...

2331
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:08,500
Dio...

2332
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I will kill you!

2333
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
We’re one and the same; you want
to exact your revenge! I admire that!

2334
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

2335
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

2336
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Speedwagon!

2337
02:48:23,312 --> 02:48:27,937
Right!

2338
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Mr. Joestar!

2339
02:48:27,937 --> 02:48:32,562
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

2340
02:48:32,562 --> 02:48:37,187
<i>I’ll suck you dry</i>

2341
02:48:36,300 --> 02:48:54,900
JoJo!

2342
02:48:37,187 --> 02:48:41,812
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

2343
02:48:41,812 --> 02:48:46,437
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

2344
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:31,700
Utterly pathetic!

2345
02:48:46,437 --> 02:48:51,062
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

2346
02:48:51,062 --> 02:48:55,687
<i>Useless, useless, useless, useless!</i>

2347
02:48:54,900 --> 02:49:13,500
<i>Utterly pathetic! I’m grasping
your carotid artery, JoJo!</i>

2348
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
<i>I obtained this power</i>

2349
02:48:58,500 --> 02:48:45,100
What! The sword is freezing—

2350
02:49:01,375 --> 02:49:02,125
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

2351
02:49:02,125 --> 02:49:02,875
<i>So I could steal everything from you</i>

2352
02:49:02,875 --> 02:49:03,625
<i>I’ll dull this pain</i>

2353
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:07,000
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

2354
02:49:08,642 --> 02:49:11,928
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

2355
02:49:11,900 --> 02:48:58,500
You fools!

2356
02:49:11,928 --> 02:49:15,214
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

2357
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:32,100
<i>With this, you’ll become
one of my undead servants</i>

2358
02:49:15,214 --> 02:49:18,500
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

2359
02:49:18,500 --> 02:49:21,785
<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

2360
02:49:21,785 --> 02:49:25,071
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

2361
02:49:25,071 --> 02:49:28,357
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

2362
02:49:25,300 --> 02:49:11,900
Not a chance!

2363
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
You did it! You defeated Dio!

2364
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:50,700
<i>Ironic, isn’t it, Dio?</i>

2365
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:07,000
<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

2366
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:13,000
<i>Why don’t you freeze me now, Dio!</i>

2367
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
My fist... Just from hitting him!

2368
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

2369
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
I can’t be...

2370
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,000
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

2371
02:50:24,666 --> 02:50:28,000
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

2372
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:31,333
<i>DIO: Let’s test your willpower
JOJO: I will reach you!</i>

2373
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,000
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

2374
02:50:36,500 --> 02:50:37,500
<i>JOJO: Us humans...
DIO: To be human is to have limits</i>

2375
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:38,500
<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

2376
02:50:38,166 --> 02:51:14,500
Not yet!!

2377
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:42,000
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2378
02:50:43,666 --> 02:50:47,000
<i>DIO: I’ll chip away at this body to prove it
JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

2379
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:50,333
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

2380
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2381
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:55,000
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

2382
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2383
02:50:59,916 --> 02:51:03,750
<i>JOJO: Our connection, it’s here
DIO: Even when I’ve thrown away my humanity</i>

2384
02:51:03,750 --> 02:51:07,583
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

2385
02:51:07,583 --> 02:51:11,416
<i>With my life on the
line, I’ll prove it now!</i>

2386
02:51:11,416 --> 02:51:15,250
<i>-Dio! Dio! Dio!
-JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

2387
02:51:14,500 --> 02:51:50,833
Watch out! He’s shooting
hot liquid out of his eyes!

2388
02:51:15,250 --> 02:51:19,083
“I was only trying to be friendly!”

2389
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
“I like being number one!”

2390
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
“My eye!”

2391
02:51:29,166 --> 02:51:33,500
“I think my finger went in his eye.”

2392
02:51:30,500 --> 02:50:41,500
Crumble to dust!

2393
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:37,833
Dio!

2394
02:51:37,833 --> 02:51:42,166
<i>I won’t stop beating you
until you’re finished!</i>

2395
02:51:42,166 --> 02:51:46,500
This is impossible!

2396
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:50,833
The heat is coursing through me!

2397
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
I’m melting!

2398
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000

02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I can’t wait to hear all about it!

2434
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
America, how nice!

2435
02:54:11,700 --> 02:55:01,100
<i>This is the start of his mythos!</i>

2436
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I wanna go there too,

2437
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
And try to dig up some oil for myself!

2438
02:54:18,666 --> 02:54:22,000
Damn it...

2439
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:25,333
But after this, a fateful
moment was soon to come...

2440
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
This story will be passed down
until the world has come full circle.

2441
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:38,300
That will be the life’s work
of Speedwagon the meddler...

2442
02:54:38,300 --> 02:54:44,500
But, the one to tell you what
happens right now won’t be me...

2443
02:54:44,500 --> 02:54:50,700
<i>I pray that today will never end</i>

2444
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Erina,

2445
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:56,900
<i>In the midst of a carousel of stars</i>

2446
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:06,500
<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>

2447
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:50,500
<i>This ark is swarming with his followers!</i>

2448
02:55:01,625 --> 02:55:22,875
Go back to our cabin.

2449
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
What’s wrong?

2450
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:12,900
When you’re next to me...

2451
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,000
I have lured him here.

2452
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:15,500
I’m happy!

2453
02:55:15,500 --> 02:55:18,100
I feel the same.

2454
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:20,700
I wish you could’ve met my father...

2455
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,500
Well, let’s go and eat!

2456
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:27,500
Jonathan?

2457
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:28,500
That’s...

2458
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,000
Don’t forget to lock the door!

2459
02:55:38,000 --> 02:54:22,666
<i>My ripple!</i>

2460
02:55:50,500 --> 02:56:39,900
Please, spare the child!

2461
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,500
My body...

2462
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Have you come?

2463
02:55:58,500 --> 02:55:59,500
Dio...

2464
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:01,500
JoJo...

2465
02:56:02,750 --> 02:56:05,250
I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

2466
02:56:05,250 --> 02:56:07,750
I used to despise you so much,

2467
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:13,000
But now I respect you...

2468
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
That’s because I’ve realised something!

2469
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,000
If there is a God that controls fate,

2470
02:56:19,250 --> 02:54:29,750
Please look!

2471
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:26,000
Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

2472
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,500
You’re the reason I got this power,

2473
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
And you’re the reason why...

2474
02:56:35,937 --> 02:56:37,812
The world has slipped from my grasp!

2475
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:39,000
<i>I will end it all</i>

2476
02:56:37,812 --> 02:56:39,687
When will it...

2477
02:56:39,687 --> 02:56:41,562
Be enough for you?

2478
02:56:39,900 --> 02:57:29,300
Run!

2479
02:56:42,500 --> 02:56:45,000
That’s exactly what our destiny is!

2480
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:52,000
I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.

2481
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:56,000
And live in eternal glory!

2482
02:56:53,333 --> 02:55:38,000
<i>I can’t speak—can’t breathe—</i>

2483
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,000
JoJo...

2484
02:57:00,250 --> 02:57:00,750
You and I...

2485
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Are one and the same in this world!

2486
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Lord Dio! Look, look, look!

2487
02:57:10,625 --> 02:56:47,875
<i>This is the start of my mythos</i>

2488
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
JoJo?

2489
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:22,000
<i>From light to darkness</i>

2490
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:26,000
<i>And restart it all</i>

2491
02:57:26,666 --> 02:57:28,000
<i>For this is Dio’s World!</i>

2492
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,333
Right, Erina Joestar?

2493
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Dio!

2494
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

2495
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Shall we torture him to death?!

2496
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Or maybe enjoy watching him asphyxiate?!

2497
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Wang Chan!

2498
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:04,000
<i>Painlessly cut his head
from his shoulders!</i>

2499
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,000
<i>I won’t tolerate any insults!</i>

2500
02:58:09,500 --> 02:58:10,500
<i>My friend, Jonathan Joestar—</i>

2501
02:58:10,500 --> 02:58:11,500
<i>I’ll take you as my own</i>

2502
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:18,000
<i>Your blood will become my future!</i>

2503
02:58:20,500 --> 02:58:25,500
<i>I’ll tie our futures together</i>

2504
02:58:21,640 --> 02:59:38,920
<i>JoJo!</i>

2505
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:30,500
<i>With my final ripple!</i>

2506
02:58:30,500 --> 02:58:35,500
<i>JoJo!</i>

2507
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:40,500
<i>JoJo!</i>

2508
02:58:40,500 --> 02:58:45,500
<i>I felt it tear. Something
important inside me just tore</i>

2509
02:58:45,500 --> 02:58:50,500
Jonathan!

2510
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:02,500
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2511
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:55,500
ERINA: How could this be?!
JOJO: Get out of here!

2512
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
<i>Hey, JoJo</i>

2513
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
I won’t, JoJo...

2514
02:59:02,875 --> 02:59:08,625
<i>I will burn with you</i>

2515
02:59:08,625 --> 02:59:14,375
<i>Until everything turns to ash</i>

2516
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:17,000
<i>I’ll disappear</i>

2517
02:59:14,375 --> 02:59:20,125
<i>(The flash of flames)</i>

2518
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
<i>Everything is connected</i>

2519
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
<i>You can’t ask me to live!</i>

2520
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
<i>There’s a meaning to it all!</i>

2521
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:32,000
<i>JOJO: It’s alright if you cry
ERINA: Your courage is too cruel!</i>

2522
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:37,000
<i>JOJO: You will be
ERINA: I will be</i>

2523
02:59:36,500 --> 02:58:49,500
<i>In the end, I, Dio, will triumph!</i>

2524
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:42,000
<i>The one to spin the thread of fate</i>

2525
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2526
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
<i>Just like my mother
died for me, I’ll—</i>

2527
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
<i>I’ll live</i>

2528
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
{\an8}<i>(Light and darkness flicker and flash)</i>

2529
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
{\an8}<i>(Flames are burning everything up)</i>

2530
02:59:54,966 --> 03:01:10,900
<i>JOJO: With you!
DIO: I will live!</i>

2531
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
<i>Farewell!</i>

2532
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
<i>I’m still alive! </i>

2533
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:11,720
<i>No, it’s because of you</i>

2534
03:00:13,780 --> 03:00:15,480
Lost consciousness.

2535
03:00:15,632 --> 03:00:14,397
Before I...

2536
03:00:16,867 --> 03:00:15,632
You would strike...

2537
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:18,720
I know what you’re like...

2538
03:00:18,102 --> 03:00:16,867
I figured...

2539
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:21,680
Let me go, JoJo!

2540
03:00:29,080 --> 03:00:29,760
He’s...

2541
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Dead...

2542
03:00:41,450 --> 03:01:00,349
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

2543
03:01:01,259 --> 03:00:27,566
<i>If it weren’t for you...</i>

2544
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:14,800
<i>That proud life of his</i>

2545
03:01:10,900 --> 03:02:26,833
{\an8}<i>(The sunlight yellow gleam shines)</i>

2546
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:18,800
<i>Vanished into the dusts of time</i>

2547
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,800
<i>But this fateful adventure</i>

2548
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,800
<i>(This bizarre adventure)</i>

2549
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:28,800
<i>Will become an inheritance</i>

2550
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:31,800
<i>Passed down forever</i>

2551
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:36,800
<i>His golden spirit</i>

2552
03:01:34,953 --> 03:01:01,259
<i>Isn’t that right, Dio?</i>

2553
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:40,800
<i>(Phantom Blood)</i>

2554
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:48,800
<i>Like two who make one,</i>

2555
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:51,800
<i>We feel a bizarre friendship</i>

2556
03:01:59,300 --> 03:03:10,300
<i>(Our golden spirit will shine)</i>

2557
03:02:02,849 --> 03:00:32,950
{\an8}<i>(Like blood through a vein,
mud is pulsating)</i>

2558
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:09,800
<i>Now I’ll...</i>

2559
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:14,800
<i>Keep looking at the stars</i>

2560
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:21,800
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>

2561
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:26,800
<i>We’ll reach out to the stars</i>

2562
03:02:24,300 --> 03:01:41,300
<i>(The tale will keep on being told)</i>

2563
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,800
<i>Our two fates</i>

2564
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:34,800
<i>Have become one</i>

2565
03:02:36,050 --> 03:02:38,550
{\an8}<i>(That immortal poem echoes quietly)</i>

2566
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:40,800
<i>Until the world</i>

2567
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:43,800
{\an8}<i>(One saw stars)</i>

2568
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:45,800
<i>Is born anew</i>

2569
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:47,800
{\an8}<i>(The stars are shimmering)</i>

2570
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:53,800
{\an8}<i>(One saw mud)</i>

2571
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:07,800
{\an8}<i>(Let the golden wind blow)</i>

2572
03:03:07,300 --> 03:02:24,300
<i>(Even when the world resets)</i>

2573
03:03:10,300 --> 03:03:15,300
{\an8}<i>(And the shadow of midnight
blue darkness grows)</i>

2574
03:03:15,300 --> 03:03:20,300
<i>(Living in the shadow of history)</i>

2575
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:28,800
<i>(We’ll stop the flow of time)</i>

2576
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

2577
03:03:50,778 --> 03:03:58,736
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.

2578
03:03:58,736 --> 03:04:06,693
This is a public [streamed] performance.

2579
03:04:06,693 --> 03:04:14,651
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,

2580
03:04:14,651 --> 03:04:22,609
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.

2581
03:04:22,609 --> 03:04:30,566
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.

2582
03:04:30,566 --> 03:04:38,524
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.

2583
03:04:38,524 --> 03:04:46,481
Thank you for today.

2584
03:04:46,481 --> 03:04:54,439
The musical will close tomorrow, though.

2585
03:04:54,439 --> 03:05:02,396
This type of role has been
played by others before,

2586
03:05:02,396 --> 03:05:10,354
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.

2587
03:05:10,354 --> 03:05:18,312
There have been many
things that led to this day.

2588
03:05:18,312 --> 03:05:26,269
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...

2589
03:05:26,269 --> 03:05:34,227
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...

2590
03:05:34,227 --> 03:05:42,184
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.

2591
03:05:42,184 --> 03:05:50,142
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

2592
03:05:50,142 --> 03:05:58,099
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—

2593
03:05:58,099 --> 03:06:06,057
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.

2594
03:06:06,057 --> 03:06:14,015
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.

2595
03:06:14,015 --> 03:06:21,972
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.

2596
03:06:21,972 --> 03:06:29,930
From the bottom of my heart,

2597
03:06:29,930 --> 03:06:37,887
Pow.

2598
03:06:37,887 --> 03:06:45,845
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!

2599
03:06:45,845 --> 03:06:53,803
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.

2600
03:06:53,803 --> 03:07:01,760
Thank you for today!

2601
03:07:01,760 --> 03:07:09,718
Did you have fun, everyone?!

2602
03:07:09,718 --> 03:07:17,675
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.

2603
03:07:17,675 --> 03:07:25,633
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.

2604
03:07:25,633 --> 03:07:33,590
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.

2605
03:07:33,590 --> 03:07:41,548
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.

2606
03:07:41,548 --> 03:07:49,506
I—are you worried?

2607
03:07:49,506 --> 03:07:57,463
Nah, it’s probably okay.

2608
03:07:57,463 --> 03:08:05,421
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!

2609
03:08:05,421 --> 03:08:13,378
-He’s—that’s in the past.

2610
03:08:13,378 --> 03:08:21,336
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.

2611
03:08:21,336 --> 03:08:29,293
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.

2612
03:08:29,293 --> 03:08:37,251
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,

2613
03:08:37,251 --> 03:08:45,209
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.

2614
03:08:45,209 --> 03:08:53,166
And I’m relieved that we made it.

2615
03:08:53,166 --> 03:09:01,124
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!

2616
03:09:01,124 --> 03:09:09,081
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

2617
03:09:09,081 --> 03:09:17,039
But when we made it to opening day,

2618
03:09:17,039 --> 03:09:24,996
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,

2619
03:09:24,996 --> 03:09:32,954
Which has continued up through today.

2620
03:09:32,954 --> 03:09:40,912
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.

2621
03:09:40,912 --> 03:09:48,869
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.

2622
03:09:48,869 --> 03:09:56,827
For having supported us up to this point.

2623
03:09:56,827 --> 03:10:04,784
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.

2624
03:10:04,784 --> 03:10:12,742
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

2625
03:10:12,742 --> 03:10:20,700
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.

2626
03:10:20,700 --> 03:10:28,657
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.

2627
03:10:28,657 --> 03:10:36,615
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!

2628
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thanks!

2629
03:10:36,615 --> 03:10:44,572
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.

2630
03:10:38,531 --> 03:10:49,593
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.

2631
03:10:44,572 --> 03:10:52,530
Excuse yourself...

2632
03:10:49,593 --> 03:11:00,656
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!

2633
03:10:52,530 --> 03:11:00,487
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.

2634
03:11:00,487 --> 03:11:08,445
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.

2635
03:11:00,656 --> 03:11:11,718
Everyone, do your best!

2636
03:11:01,750 --> 03:10:41,250
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

2637
03:11:08,445 --> 03:11:16,403
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.

2638
03:11:11,718 --> 03:11:22,781
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!

2639
03:11:16,403 --> 03:11:24,360
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.

2640
03:11:22,250 --> 03:11:01,750
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

2641
03:11:22,781 --> 03:11:33,843
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?

2642
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:32,318
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.

2643
03:11:32,318 --> 03:11:40,275
You were just that wonderful.

2644
03:11:33,843 --> 03:11:44,906
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!

2645
03:11:40,275 --> 03:11:48,233
[INAUDIBLE]

2646
03:11:42,750 --> 03:11:22,250
Now to everyone at the theatre,

2647
03:11:44,906 --> 03:11:55,968
I’m gonna watch it too!

2648
03:11:48,233 --> 03:11:56,190
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...

2649
03:11:55,968 --> 03:12:07,031
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

2650
03:11:56,190 --> 03:12:04,148
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—

2651
03:12:03,250 --> 03:11:42,750
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

2652
03:12:04,148 --> 03:12:12,106
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.

2653
03:12:07,031 --> 03:12:18,093
Pardon me.

2654
03:12:12,106 --> 03:12:20,063
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.

2655
03:12:18,093 --> 03:12:29,156
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!

2656
03:12:20,063 --> 03:12:28,021
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

2657
03:12:23,750 --> 03:12:03,250
It was wonderful. Thanks!

2658
03:12:29,156 --> 03:12:40,218
Truly, thank you for today!

2659
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
Thank you everyone in the cast!

2660
03:12:40,218 --> 03:12:51,281
{\an8}[TN: Everyone’s muted for about 2 min]

2661
03:12:51,281 --> 03:13:02,343
[INAUDIBLE]

2662
03:13:02,343 --> 03:13:13,406
MAMORU: It’s already over.

2663
03:13:13,406 --> 03:13:24,468
[INAUDIBLE]

2664
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Thank you!

2665
03:13:20,750 --> 03:13:16,250
MAMORU: Do your best!

2666
03:13:25,250 --> 03:13:20,750
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

2667
03:13:29,750 --> 03:13:25,250
Definitely, please support
tomorrow’s performance too!

2668
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Thank you! Thank you!
