{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Is it possible to be this happy?}

2623
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:07,686
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:11:07,710 --> 03:11:08,475
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:11:08,502 --> 03:11:10,877
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:11:10,904 --> 03:11:11,457
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:13,299
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
