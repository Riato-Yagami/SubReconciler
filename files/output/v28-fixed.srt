Ah, nothing.

Oh, no!
{\ O (spread)}

-He came at me so suddenly.
{\ O (spread)}

309
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:33,723
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (spread)}

310
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,519
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (spread)}

He’s a friendly creature, but

Alright JoJo, I’ll tell

I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

I was only trying to be friendly!
{\ O (rank)}

What are you two doing?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: What are you both doing?}

334
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: One more thing}

335
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I hate dogs}

336
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,379
The way they grovel and suck

Keep your stupid dog away from me!

Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

It’s just because I love reading so much!

But they haven’t even

My mother taught me well. She

<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

In our great England, a tale of two knights

{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: There are two knights in English folklore.}

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

381
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,999
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (spread)}

382
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (gap)}
{\ T: yes}

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

386

What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?
{\ O (spread)}

387
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,999
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread)}

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank)}

What do you think?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Which do you think?}

390

The stars?

00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:21,583
Or the mud?
{\ O (spread)}

392
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,056
I...
{\ O (spread)}

393
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,271
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

394
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,999
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread)}

395
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they have no choice but to die for their master.}

396
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:53,473
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread)}

397
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (rank)}

They held onto their honour!
{\ O (spread)}

00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:57,228
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!
{\ O (spread)}

400
00:26:53,628 --> 00:27:05,999
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread)}

401
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,984
So what!
{\ O (spread)}

402
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,999
So what?
{\ O (spread)}

403
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

404
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,083
But they—
{\ O (spread)}

405
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

406
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:09,649
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread)}

407
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:10,999
Such regret...
{\ O (spread)}

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:26:48,999
I think...
{\ O (spread)}

409
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: That soul-dissolving powerlessness}

410
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: All they saw was mud.}

411
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,846
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (spread)}

412
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:23,878
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread)}

413
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,090
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (spread)}

Listen!

You’re a noble! You have it all!
{\ O (spread)}

You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread)}

417
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: So, in order to fulfill that responsibility, shouldn't we think about what we can accomplish with our lives?}

418
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: I}

Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!

They come after us humans

Could you call something

What are you yammering on about!

So then, what exactly is “courage”?
{\ O (spread)}

1883
02:14:21,845 --> 02:14:23,570
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!
{\ O (spread)}

Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

Let me say this to the Stone

Finally, we meet.

Don’t get carried away!
{\ O (spread)}

Perhaps you can heal this

You’re the one who put it there!
{\ O (spread)}

Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.
{\ O (spread)}

02:22:46,444 --> 02:22:49,037
I’ll be using your lives...
{\ O (spread)}

To purge this wound!
{\ O (spread)}

You bastard!
{\ O (spread)}

2018
02:22:54,433 --> 02:22:58,622
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?
{\ O (spread)}

Do you remember how many slices of

I’ll make you submit!

{\ O (spread)}

2023
02:23:30,384 --> 02:23:33,848
Utterly pathetic!

It’s freezing?!
{\ O (spread)}

2025
02:23:35,909 --> 02:23:40,858
I guessed that this energy of yours

{\ O (spread)}

2026
02:23:40,915 --> 02:23:45,853
I am able to control my own body at will.
{\ O (spread)}

2027
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,951
If I freeze up all of your veins,

Then you won’t be able to use that power!

Useless, useless, useless, useless!
{\ O (spread)}

Breathing techniques? Ripple?
{\ O (spread)}

2033
02:24:10,875 --> 02:24:13,696
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,
{\ O (spread)}

2034
02:24:13,743 --> 02:24:19,250
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!
{\ O (spread)}

2035
02:24:26,304 --> 02:24:30,880
Looks like your companions

{\ O (spread)}

02:24:30,919 --> 02:24:32,931
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...
{\ O (spread)}

2037
02:24:34,387 --> 02:24:37,935
That’s right. Do you remember?
{\ O (spread)}

2038

The story of the knights

What?
{\ O (spread)}

2040
02:24:44,171 --> 02:24:49,634
The tragic queen who was sentenced

{\ O (spread)}

2041
02:24:49,806 --> 02:24:53,946
After a failed assassination

Yes!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: Yes.}

2043

We listened to it together, didn’t we?!
{\ O (spread)}

2044
02:24:54,502 --> 02:24:56,769
Mary Stuart!
{\ O (spread)}

2045
02:24:58,060 --> 02:24:59,999
It was about the ones who served her!
{\ O (spread)}

2046
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of those two proud knights...
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: The story of the knight that my parents told}

2047
02:25:02,000 --> 02:24:52,199

JoJo, Dio!
{\ O (spread)}

2049
02:25:05,958 --> 02:25:10,541
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,
{\ O (spread)}

2050
02:25:10,639 --> 02:25:15,182
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.
{\ O (spread)}

Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—
{\ O (spread)}

2052
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
This is a story of knightly pride!
{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: It's the story of a proud knight.}

2053
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,457
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2054
02:25:29,689 --> 02:25:34,073
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>

<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2057
02:25:43,418 --> 02:25:47,556
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2058
02:25:48,046 --> 02:25:51,560
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2059
02:25:52,721 --> 02:26:00,889
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2060
02:26:01,092 --> 02:26:10,163
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2061
02:26:11,032 --> 02:26:15,620
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2062
02:26:15,672 --> 02:26:19,827
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2063
02:26:20,176 --> 02:26:24,733
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2064
02:26:24,784 --> 02:26:29,072
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2065
02:26:29,573 --> 02:26:33,527
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,
{\ O (spread)}

2066
02:26:33,575 --> 02:26:37,774
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.
{\ O (spread)}

2067
02:26:38,804 --> 02:26:42,832
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2068

<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2069
02:26:47,732 --> 02:26:52,201
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2070
02:26:52,278 --> 02:26:56,724
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2071
02:26:56,823 --> 02:27:01,196
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2072
02:27:01,417 --> 02:27:05,957
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2073
02:27:06,033 --> 02:27:14,427
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2074
02:27:14,545 --> 02:27:19,366
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2075
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:24,674
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2076
02:27:25,067 --> 02:27:27,219
But in the moment they
were to be executed—
{\ O (spread)}

2077
02:27:27,270 --> 02:27:29,703
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!
{\ O (spread)}

2078
02:27:29,731 --> 02:27:32,243
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.
{\ O (spread)}

2079
02:27:32,329 --> 02:27:34,620
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!
{\ O (spread)}

2080
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:38,008
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!
{\ O (spread)}

2081
02:27:38,095 --> 02:27:42,682
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!
{\ O (spread)}

2082
02:27:47,423 --> 02:27:51,150
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:27:51,226 --> 02:27:56,145
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:27:56,654 --> 02:28:01,129
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2085
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:05,720
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s

{\ O (spread)}

02:28:05,806 --> 02:28:09,947
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2087
02:28:10,024 --> 02:28:14,902
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2088
02:28:14,991 --> 02:28:18,379
<i>As though it were alive!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2089
02:28:18,436 --> 02:28:20,517
<i>And that is the story,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2090
02:28:20,572 --> 02:28:28,033
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Until the very end!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2092
02:28:38,211 --> 02:28:39,919
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!
{\ O (spread)}

2093
02:28:39,964 --> 02:28:41,588
Oh, what loyal hearts!
{\ O (spread)}

2094
02:28:41,636 --> 02:28:44,206
But those two should
have done a better job!
{\ O (spread)}

2095
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:46,718
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

2096
02:28:46,745 --> 02:28:48,874
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!
{\ O (spread)}

2097
02:28:48,926 --> 02:28:51,307
It might be as you say, however—
{\ O (spread)}

2098
02:28:51,357 --> 02:28:53,409
There is nothing that is without meaning.
{\ O (spread)}

2099
02:28:53,464 --> 02:28:56,596
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.
{\ O (spread)}

2100
02:28:56,857 --> 02:28:58,320
Everything is connected!
{\ O (spread)}

2101
02:28:58,350 --> 02:29:02,116
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

2102
02:29:03,818 --> 02:29:08,335
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2103
02:29:08,413 --> 02:29:12,853
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2104
02:29:12,931 --> 02:29:17,630
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2105
02:29:17,729 --> 02:29:24,666
<i>Either one—</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2106
02:29:25,555 --> 02:29:26,664
<i>JoJo</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Dio</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:29:29,707 --> 02:29:36,151
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2109
02:29:44,697 --> 02:29:46,801
I turned those two
{\ O (spread)}

2110
02:29:47,081 --> 02:29:52,569
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!
{\ O (spread)}

2111
02:29:53,498 --> 02:29:59,103
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (spread)}

2112
02:29:59,142 --> 02:30:00,352
It can’t be!
{\ O (spread)}

2113
02:30:08,990 --> 02:30:11,207
Such grotesque forms!
{\ O (spread)}

2114
02:30:11,248 --> 02:30:15,866
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!
{\ O (spread)}

2115
02:30:16,531 --> 02:30:18,774
Don’t you think so?
{\ O (spread)}

2116
02:30:19,842 --> 02:30:22,485
Kill them all!
{\ O (spread)}

2117
02:30:22,748 --> 02:30:25,006

Is that what you take pride in?

Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

2583
03:04:25,866 --> 03:04:44,386
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread)}

2584
03:04:44,671 --> 03:04:58,306
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread)}

2585
03:05:09,064 --> 03:05:15,022
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.
{\ O (spread)}

2586

I had the honour of performing the double

03:05:32,034 --> 03:05:39,727
Thank you for today.
{\ O (spread)}

The musical will close tomorrow, though.
{\ O (spread)}

2589
03:06:01,847 --> 03:06:14,640
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread)}

2590
03:06:16,898 --> 03:06:31,437
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.
{\ O (spread)}

2591
03:06:32,652 --> 03:06:50,295
There have been many
things that led to this day.
{\ O (spread)}

2592
03:06:50,533 --> 03:07:13,877
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...
{\ O (spread)}

2593
03:07:15,065 --> 03:07:35,047
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...
{\ O (spread)}

2594
03:07:36,931 --> 03:07:57,844
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.
{\ O (spread)}

2595
03:07:58,640 --> 03:08:08,579
And foremost, the people
who came every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2596
03:08:08,813 --> 03:08:22,802
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2597
03:08:23,060 --> 03:08:36,730
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.
{\ O (spread)}

2598
03:08:36,961 --> 03:08:46,022
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.
{\ O (spread)}

2599
03:08:46,276 --> 03:09:04,404
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.
{\ O (spread)}

2600
03:09:04,662 --> 03:09:14,262

{\ O (spread)}

03:09:14,450 --> 03:09:20,593
Pow.

2602
03:09:20,766 --> 03:09:28,459

{\ O (spread)}

2603
03:10:15,472 --> 03:10:30,999

Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.
{\ O (spread)}

2604
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000

{\ O (rank)}
{\ T: thank you.}

2605
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,049
Did you have fun, everyone?!
{\ O (spread)}

2606
03:10:36,053 --> 03:10:38,416
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.
{\ O (spread)}

2607
03:10:38,808 --> 03:10:42,179
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2608
03:10:42,230 --> 03:10:43,933
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.
{\ O (spread)}

2609
03:10:43,958 --> 03:10:46,532
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.
{\ O (spread)}

2610
03:10:46,560 --> 03:10:48,600
I—are you worried?
{\ O (spread)}

2611
03:10:48,635 --> 03:10:49,333
Nah, it’s probably okay.
{\ O (spread)}

2612
03:10:49,333 --> 03:10:50,823
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!
{\ O (spread)}

2613
03:10:50,823 --> 03:10:52,496
-He’s—that’s in the past.
{\ O (spread)}

2614
03:10:52,543 --> 03:10:55,450
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.
{\ O (spread)}

2615
03:10:55,508 --> 03:10:59,009
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.
{\ O (spread)}

2616
03:10:59,070 --> 03:11:02,334
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,
{\ O (spread)}

2617
03:11:02,390 --> 03:11:05,085
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2618
03:11:05,131 --> 03:11:06,560
And I’m relieved that we made it.
{\ O (spread)}

2619
03:11:06,606 --> 03:11:09,622
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!
{\ O (spread)}

2620
03:11:13,644 --> 03:11:17,502
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2621
03:11:17,556 --> 03:11:19,306
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2622
03:11:19,369 --> 03:11:24,802
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2623
03:11:24,863 --> 03:11:26,129
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:11:26,181 --> 03:11:30,343
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:11:30,424 --> 03:11:36,467
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:11:36,539 --> 03:11:39,240
For having supported us up to this point.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:11:39,288 --> 03:11:41,095
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.
{\ O (spread)}

2628
03:11:41,149 --> 03:11:44,972
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?
{\ O (spread)}

2629
03:11:45,024 --> 03:11:46,318
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2630
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:49,049
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.
{\ O (spread)}

2631
03:11:49,095 --> 03:11:50,699
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!
{\ O (spread)}

2632
03:11:50,737 --> 03:11:51,969
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.
{\ O (spread)}

2633
03:11:52,002 --> 03:11:52,820
Excuse yourself...
{\ O (spread)}

2634
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:55,169
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.
{\ O (spread)}

2635
03:11:55,225 --> 03:11:58,856
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.
{\ O (spread)}

2636
03:11:58,904 --> 03:11:59,811
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.
{\ O (spread)}

2637
03:11:59,858 --> 03:12:03,309
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2638
03:12:03,346 --> 03:12:06,167
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread)}

2639
03:12:06,237 --> 03:12:07,414
You were just that wonderful.

{\ O (spread)}

2642
03:12:10,450 --> 03:12:14,949
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—
{\ O (spread)}

2643
03:12:15,041 --> 03:12:22,614
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.
{\ O (spread)}

2644
03:12:22,712 --> 03:12:28,289
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.
{\ O (spread)}

2645
03:12:28,460 --> 03:12:31,999
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.
