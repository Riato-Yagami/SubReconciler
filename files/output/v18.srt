You, watching this.

Yeah, you there.

4
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,720
You have been chosen.

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,816
I’m leaving this record of my
will behind for the next generation.

7
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:41,952
After this, I am headed to an
archaeological site in Mexico.
{\ O (spread): You are watching this}

8
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:48,088
Time has started to move again
after standing still for 49 years.
{\ O (spread): yes}

9
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:54,224
It keeps moving forward.

10
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:00,360
That is why I have to
create this record now.
{\ O (spread): You have been chosen}

11
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680
If something should
happen to me, I—
{\ O (rank): I decided it was worth believing.}

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,080
Never mind.

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Back to the story.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,104
As you all know, this foundation
was created to support various fields,

15
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:23,128
Such as medicine, pharmacy, and archaeology—

16
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:28,152
All with the goal of contributing
to the welfare of humanity.

17
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:33,176
That’s how it looks on the outside.

18
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:38,200
Right, that’s the cover.

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Now, listen carefully.

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,173
There is a secret to why I established
this foundation here in the USA,

21
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:52,146
And created our branches around the world...
{\ O (spread): If something happens to me in the future}

22
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:58,120
That secret is...
{\ O (spread): no}

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
The Stone Mask.
{\ O (rank): Let's get back to the topic}

24
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:27,840
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>

25
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,800
That’s why I’m here today, to leave
behind a record of the tale of that mask.

27
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,200
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It all began in the 13th century.

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,297
Deep in the Central Mexican Plateau,
a tribe was raising a battle cry.

30
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:57,794
They were members of the
people of the sun—the Aztecs!

31
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:01,291
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): Please listen carefully}

00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,788
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>
{\ O (spread): I founded this foundation here in the United States and have branches all over the world.}

33
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:08,285
<i>(Chief! Chief! Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It's to pursue the secret of something.}

34
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,782
<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>
{\ O (spread): What is that something?}

35
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:15,279
<i>Blood be life, life be power</i>
{\ O (spread): Stone Mask}

36
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,776
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>
{\ O (spread): The Foundation's true purpose is to uncover the secrets of the Stone Mask.}

37
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:22,280
{\an8}<i>(Power!)</i>
{\ O (spread): And today, I'm recording the story of the mask.}

38
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,080
<i>Eternal! Power! Eternal! Life!</i>
{\ O (rank): And the story of the golden spirit that was there}

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,593
{\an8}<i>(Eternal!)</i>

40
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:33,106
{\an8}<i>(Life!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It began in the 16th century}

41

{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>

00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:37,645
<i>Shalt thou become our life?</i>

44
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,158
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): I have the power of life, eternal power, eternal life in my hands.}

45
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,671
{\an8}<i>(With pleasure!)</i>

46
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:42,184
<i>Blood of the living</i>

47
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:43,697
{\an8}<i>(Chief!)</i>
{\ O (spread): We are children of the sun}

<i>Life is power</i>

{\ O (spread): was disliked}

50
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,236
<i>The power in this hand</i>
{\ O (spread): But one day the tribe suddenly disappeared.}

51
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:49,760
{\an8}<i>(Chief! Ha!)</i>
{\ O (spread): All of this mystery lies in the Stone Mask}

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
<i>(We are children of the sun!)</i>
{\ O (rank): This story is about the Stone Mask}

53
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:59,380
<i>(For us Aztecs, life becomes power!)</i>

54
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>(We, Aztecs, have drawn the sun’s wrath!)</i>

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,842
Became entwined in the
unfortunate fate of two young men.

59
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:26,684
With that, let’s pick up the narrative
on the outskirts of London in 1868.

60
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:30,526
Bloody hell! This rain is awful,
it came outta nowhere!

61
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,368
Oi Cammie, you feelin’ cold?
I’ll warm you right up!

62
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:38,210
Why don’t we stay up all
night, you sweet little thing?

63
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,052
Your voice is sweeter
than birdsong, Debbie!

64
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:45,894
Wot have we here!

65
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:49,736
That carriage has gone and wrecked itself!

66
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:53,578
No one’s swarmed it yet! Alright!
First come, first served! Let’s go!

67
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:57,420
-Hang on...

68
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,262
-Hurry up! C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!

69
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:05,104
-Wait!

70
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:08,946
I said wait!

71
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:12,788
Yahoo!

72
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:16,630
Darling, wait! We really
shouldn’t be doing this!

73
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,472

they gotta be nobles!
{\ O (spread): There must be something good in this box}

It’s a treasure hunt! C’mere and look!

75
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:28,156
This bloke must’ve died instantly.

76
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:32,000
Look at that! What a
pretty necklace! All mine!

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This box’ll have somethin’ good...
{\ O (rank): Find something valuable, something valuable}

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,714
What the—
{\ O (spread): Don't have a nice ring?}

79
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,428
Just a creepy mask!
{\ O (spread): What are you doing?}

80
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,142
Don’t need that!

81
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:43,856
Darling!

82
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,570
What?!

83
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,284
In the carriage! A baby survived!

84
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:49,000
A baby?! Leave it there!

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh...

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, isn’t this a nice ring? I’ll take that!

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
-What are you doing?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,555
One man’s misfortune is
another man’s fortune!

90
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:04,110
Have a look!

91
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,665
A pocket watch too!
{\ O (spread): Did you release me?}

92
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,220
Nice teeth!
{\ O (spread): My wife and son}

93
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,775
Aren’t these nice teeth?
They’ll fetch a pretty penny.
{\ O (spread): His wife had already passed away}

94
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,330
That’s enough!
{\ O (spread): The baby is safe}

95
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,885
Nobles can buy replacement
teeth! And he’s a noble!

96
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,440
No bad deed done here. Just calm down.

97
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,000
Let’s take some of those upper teeth.
{\ O (spread): Is this fate?}

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You... Did you rescue us...?
{\ O (rank): I want to thank you for saving my life}

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are my wife and son...?
{\ O (rank): My name is Joestar}

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She croa—
{\ O (spread): I will never forget this kindness}

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your wife has already passed away
it seems, but your child is safe.
{\ O (gap): It's not worth mentioning, but}

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Go get him!
{\ O (spread): brand}

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this too is fate...

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to express my gratitude
to you for saving my life...

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My name is Joestar...

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will never forget your kindness!

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don’t have a fancy name, but
please call me Brando.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Dario Brando!

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,444
And so the years flow by until 1880.

110
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:15,888
It’s an era filled with frenzy.

111
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:21,332
<i>(Like the ground before a storm,

<i>(The era is changing, and now is
the time to make ourselves rich)</i>

114

<i>(In sunlight yellow day, with pride

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000

<i>I might already be in hell,

<i>And yet, my mum told me to be noble</i>

<i>She kept on saying that,

Just like that...

{\ O (rank): Under this murky sky, I continued to struggle and die}

Oh yeah!
{\ O (spread): Let's receive our inheritance now, it's all from our parents, let's go on a journey}

You’ve got something good today too, eh?
{\ O (spread): I still have nothing in my hands, so let's start from here}

256

Give it back!
{\ O (spread): Joestar, you have the sun in the sky}

Over here!
{\ O (spread): That's right, Joestar}

258
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,000
Hey Erina, I heard that
your old man’s a quack!

259

My father’s a real doctor!
{\ O (rank): Your father is a good doctor}

Oh really? This hat looks expensive!
{\ O (spread): What do you think?}

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Stop it! It was a birthday
present from my mother!
{\ O (spread): But it's an expensive hat}

Stop right there!
{\ O (spread): Stop it, your mother gave it to you for your birthday.}

263
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What are you doing?! Take this!

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hate when guys try to
act cool in front of girls!
{\ O (spread): What are you doing?}

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Ow! That hurt!
{\ O (spread): Just because you're in front of a girl, you're trying to act cool}

-Hey, do you know who this guy is?
{\ O (rank): Hey, do you know who this is?}

267

If he’s that Jonathan kid

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I’m gonna give him even
more of a walloping!
{\ O (spread): After all, this guy is Jona of the Joestar family.}

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He <i>is</i> the Joestars’ Jonathan!

{\ O (spread): Um, are you okay?}

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Eh?!
{\ O (spread): Leave me alone}

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let’s go already! Shit!
{\ O (spread): but}

275
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Uh... Are you alright?
{\ O (rank): I did it because I wanted to, not to be thanked by you.}

276
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Leave me alone!
{\ O (gap): I'm aiming for true sincerity. You were a girl and I was having trouble with you, so I just stood up to you.}

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But...
{\ O (gap): Someday I'll be able to win}

278

I did this because I wanted to.
{\ O (rank): Okay, let's go}

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I didn’t do it to get you to thank me.
{\ O (spread): Jonathan Joestar}

280
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
My goal is to become a true gentleman.

281
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You were a damsel in distress,
so I had to stand up for you.

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I’ll beat them, someday.
{\ O (spread): you}

Let’s go, Danny!
{\ O (rank): You're Dio Brando!}

Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!
{\ O (rank): friend?}

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,333
Ah, Danny! I’ll introduce you.

292
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,666
This is my friend, Danny.
He’s a clever old hound!
{\ O (spread): What are you doing? I won't forgive you!}

293
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, and don’t worry about him biting!
{\ O (spread): I've been waiting for you, Diobrando.}

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Friend?

295
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah!
{\ O (spread): Come in. This is the mansion where you will be living from today onwards.}

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Danny! What was that for!
{\ O (spread): What's up, JoJo?}

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Danny!
{\ O (rank): You must be tired from traveling all the way from London, Dio.}

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You won’t get away with this!
{\ O (spread): From today onwards, you are part of our family. Please live your life just like our son, Jojo.}

299
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.
{\ O (rank): Yes, I am grateful for Lord Joestar's actions.}

300
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000

Come inside!
{\ O (spread): Brand, this is Inspector Archer.}

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
From today on, you’ll be
living here in our mansion.
{\ O (spread): Police? Did something happen?}

303
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Something wrong, JoJo?

304
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah, nothing.

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,586
Starting today, you are part of our family.

307
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:05,172
You’ll be given the same
kind of life as my son, JoJo.
{\ O (spread): He's quite friendly, but it seems he startled you.}

kindness, Lord Joestar.
{\ O (rank): yes.}

I’m Police Inspector Archer!
{\ O (rank): Please get along well with each other.}

Police? Has something happened?
{\ O (rank): Now, let me show you to your room.}

Oh, no!
{\ O (spread): Mr. Brand.}

314
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,120
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.

315
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,800
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...
{\ O (spread): nice to meet you!}

316
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,480
Ah, that was—

317
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,160
-He came at me so suddenly.

318
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,840
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!

319
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.

320
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes!
{\ O (rank): Don't touch my bag.}

322
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.
{\ O (spread): I'll try to carry it}

323
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Mister Brando!
{\ O (spread): 結構}

324
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I’m Police Inspector Archer!
{\ O (spread): Your hands are sticky with dog drool}

325
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Police? Has something happened?

326
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Oh, no!

327
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
I’m an old friend of the Joestars.
{\ O (spread): Listen, JoJo}

328
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Although, I could hear Danny
whimper a moment ago...

329
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Ah, that was—

330
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
-He came at me so suddenly.

331
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
When I jumped in surprise,
I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (spread): I just try to be friendly}

332
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (spread): What are you both doing?}

333
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.
{\ O (spread): One more thing}

334
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I hate dogs}

335
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?

336
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes, sir.

337
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Good.

338
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

339
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Make sure to get along with each other.

340
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

341
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mister Brando!

342
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Nice to have met you!

343
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,240
Ta-ta, JoJo!

344
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,320
Now then, let me get—
{\ O (spread): Here comes JoJo}

345
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,400
Watch it!

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don’t touch my bag!

347
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,420
I was just trying to carry it for—

348
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,320
That’s enough.

349
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

350
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
Ta-ta, JoJo!

351
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,260
Now then, let me get—

352
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,100
Watch it!

353
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,940
Don’t touch my bag!

354
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,780
I was just trying to carry it for—

355
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,620
That’s enough.

356
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,460
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

357
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!

358
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,140
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.

359
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,980
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!
{\ O (spread): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

360
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,820
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!

361
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!

362
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?

363
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—

364
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.

365
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:13,120
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.

366
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Keep your stupid dog away from me!

367
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread): How many times has this happened?}

368
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.

369
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?
{\ O (rank): All uses are correct}

370
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,977
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

371
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,834
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>

372
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,691
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>

373
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:02,548
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>

374
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,405
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>

375
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:10,262
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>

376
00:23:10,262 --> 00:23:14,120
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>

377
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

378
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,620
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>

379
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,120
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>

380
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,620
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

381
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,120
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>

382
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>

383
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>

384
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,342
It’s just because I love reading so much!

385
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:46,564
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!

386
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:50,786
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>

387
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:55,008
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread): Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

388
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:59,230
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>

389
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,452
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>

390
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:07,674
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

391
00:24:07,674 --> 00:24:11,896
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

392
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:16,120
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>

393
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

394
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>

395
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,220
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>

396
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,320
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>
{\ O (spread): graceful}

397
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,420
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>

398
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,520
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>

399
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,620
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>

400
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,720
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>

401
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,820
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>

402
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>

403
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,020
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>
{\ O (spread): Follow their example}

404
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,120
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>

405
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>

406
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,590
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>

407
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,060
But...

408
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:06,530
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.

409
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:13,000
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>

410
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.

412
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.
{\ O (rank): Always question philosophy and truth in your mind}

413
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ O (gap): There are two knights in English folklore.}

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (spread): One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank): The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

416
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Here is my question for you:
{\ O (spread): If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

417
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (spread): Here's the problem for both of you}

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ O (gap): yes}

419
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?
{\ O (spread): Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

420
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread): Is what you see beyond the prison bars the mud in front of you?}

421
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank): Or is it the star shining above?}

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ O (rank): Which do you think?}

423
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,555
The stars?

424
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:19,110
Or the mud?
{\ O (spread): I think I saw mud}

425
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,665
I...

426
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:20,220
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (spread): In the end, they have no choice but to die for their master.}

427
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,775
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread): If you're dead, you can't accomplish anything.}

428
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:21,330
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (spread): So no matter how many plans I had, I felt I had to live and do something.}

429
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:21,885
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread): I think I was looking at the stars}

430
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:22,440
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread): You lived your life to the fullest, and your two noble names will be engraved in history.}

431
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (spread): So}

432
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think...
{\ O (gap): So}

433
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (rank): How you lived, how things happened, cherish that}

434
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,500
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread): In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

435
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread): That soul-dissolving powerlessness}

436
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,500
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (spread): All they saw was mud.}

437
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,000
I think...

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,750
They held onto their honour!

440
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,500
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

441
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,250
So what!
{\ O (spread): So, in order to fulfill that responsibility, shouldn't we think about what we can accomplish with our lives?}

442
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,000
So what?
{\ O (spread): I}

443
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (rank): Neither of us have a right answer to this question.}

444
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!

445
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,100
I think...

446
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,200
They were looking at the stars!

447
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,300
They held onto their honour!

448
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,400
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!

449
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,500
So what!
{\ O (spread): Who will be the next to challenge this champion?}

450
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:10,600
So what?
{\ O (spread): Everyone, be quiet! A new friend has just asked to join our game!}

451
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:10,700
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!

452
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:10,800
But they—
{\ O (spread): How about getting to know your new friends by getting them involved in our games?}

453
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:10,900
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread): Okay! Let's do it!}

454
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,000
Such regret...
{\ O (spread): The rule is that if you get hit by the cross section even once, you lose!}

455
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (gap): If this is the rule, I'll throw it away if I do it in London!}

456
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (gap): Gong down!}

457
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,666
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (spread): Go, Jar Jarz!}

458
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,332
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread): Yay!}

459
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,998
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (spread): What a movement!}

460
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:28,664
Listen!
{\ O (spread): I've never seen that before!}

461
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,330
You’re a noble! You have it all!

462
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,000
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

464
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I—

465
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That’s enough, you two.

466
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There’s no right answer to this question.

467
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,761
Bear in mind—

468
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:55,522
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

469
00:27:55,522 --> 00:28:00,283
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

470
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:05,044
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Darstand!}

471
00:28:05,044 --> 00:28:09,805
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>
{\ O (spread): Everyone, Mina}

472
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:14,566
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>
{\ O (spread): I think my finger got in his eye.}

473
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:19,327
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>

474
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:24,088
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>

475
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:28,849
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>

476
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:33,610
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>

477
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,371
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>

478
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:43,132
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>

479
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:47,893
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>
{\ O (spread): Danny}

480
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,654
<i>The opening bell rings</i>
{\ O (spread): For some reason, Dio is trying to trap me.}

481
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:57,415
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>
{\ O (spread): I feel like I'm being invaded more and more}

482
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:02,176
Oi!
{\ O (spread): Hey Danny, my heart hurts}

483
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:06,937
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!
{\ O (spread): I'm full of anxiety}

484
00:29:06,937 --> 00:29:11,698
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!
{\ O (spread): If I were to die like this}

485
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:16,459
Our new champion!
{\ O (spread): Will everyone cry?}

486
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:21,220
You did it, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): You're always warm}

487
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,000
Danny would be proud!
{\ O (spread): Thank you for being by my side}

488
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?
{\ O (rank): If I had a mother, would it be like this?}

489
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Is there anyone?
{\ O (spread): Is this how you loved me?}

490
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Everyone listen up!
{\ O (spread): You're a little}

491
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.
{\ O (rank): My handkerchief}

492
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
His name is Dio Brando!
{\ O (rank): Hey, thanks for the handkerchief}

493
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,333
Dio Brando?
{\ O (spread): I'll be here in the morning too}

494
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,666
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?
{\ O (spread): If you'd like, come too.}

495
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah! Do it!
{\ O (spread): Danny}

496
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, let’s do it!
{\ O (gap): Are you curious?}

497
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000
-Good!
{\ O (spread): Sorry for touching you without permission.}

498
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—
{\ O (gap): It doesn't matter, the stone mask was apparently excavated from an archaeological site in Mexico.}

499
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.
{\ O (spread): Mexico}

500
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,000
That’s the bell!
{\ O (spread): I bought it at an art gallery in London when Jojo was just born.}

501
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
-Go, JoJo!
{\ O (rank): On the way back, he had a carriage accident.}

502
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Beat him up!
{\ O (spread): It was when your father helped me.}

503
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What is this move!
{\ O (rank): Are you interested?}

504
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I’ve never seen it before!
{\ O (gap): In particular}

505
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,750
Oi, JoJo!
{\ O (spread): Jojo always goes out with Danny.}

506
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,500
That’s a hit to the face!
{\ O (spread): Danny has a friendship and trust for Jojo.}

507
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,250
He lost!
{\ O (spread): Do you have a friend dog?}

508
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:31,000
Our king! Our king!
{\ O (spread): I bought Danny when Jojo was little.}

509
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!
{\ O (rank): At first, I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.}

510
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
My eye!
{\ O (spread): It didn't work out with Jojo either.}

511
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Guys, guys, guys!
{\ O (spread): But one time Jojo drowned in the river.}

512
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think my finger went in his eye.
{\ O (gap): My voice is all alone and no one can hear it}

513
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,600
I must forfeit my win. I have
to leave now, excuse me!
{\ O (spread): Just as she was about to die, a shadow heard her scream and jumped into the river. It was Danny.}

514
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,200
-Hey, hey!
{\ O (spread): Danny jumped into the river and saved Jojo's life.}

515
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,800
Dio, you were amazing!
How do you move like that?
{\ O (spread): Danny's courageous actions, knowing what life is}

516
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Teach me!
{\ O (spread): Young Jojo was touched by Danny's courage and courage.}

517
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,000
Guys! Ow...
{\ O (spread): They are best friends.}

518
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Danny...
{\ O (rank): is that so}

519
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Why is Dio always trying to bring me down?
{\ O (gap): Husband}

520
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It feels like he’s invading my life.
{\ O (rank): Ah, that's right.}

521
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>
{\ O (gap): 親友}

522
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:36,000
<i>And I’m filled with worry</i>
{\ O (spread): Elna}

523
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>What if I were to die today?</i>
{\ O (rank): Joe John}

524
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
<i>Would anyone cry for me?</i>
{\ O (spread): The two were reunited}

525
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
<i>You’re always so understanding</i>

526
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>
{\ O (rank): That wonderful curiosity led Jojo to action.}

527
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>
{\ O (gap): Immediately the two}

528
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:21,000
<i>Would she love me this way?</i>

529
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You’re...
{\ O (spread): Danny}

530
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
My hanky...
{\ O (rank): Come on over}

531
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!
{\ O (gap): You're so smart}

532
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, I’ll be back here tomorrow too,

533
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So stop by again!
{\ O (spread): Hey Jo John, what have you been digging up lately?}

534
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Danny!
{\ O (rank): No, nothing.}

535
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Has it caught your fancy?
{\ O (spread): Why hide it?}

536
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.
{\ O (gap): It's so boring}

537
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,500
It’s alright.
{\ O (spread): If you say so, I really want to see it}

538
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,000
They say this Stone Mask was
unearthed in some Mexican ruins.
{\ O (spread): People will laugh}

539
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Mexico...
{\ O (rank): I won't laugh}

540
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Mm-hmm.
{\ O (spread): I'll tell someone}

541
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.
{\ O (rank): I won't tell you, so show me}

542
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.
{\ O (gap): No.}

543
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.
{\ O (rank): Joe John}

544
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you interested in it?

545
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, no. Not especially.

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Uh...

547
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?

548
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

549
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Friendship? With a dog?

550
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.

551
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

552
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.
{\ O (rank): I'm laughing like that now}

553
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.
{\ O (gap): Vivid River Pool}

554
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
There wasn’t even one person
around who could hear his voice.
{\ O (spread): The sky gets higher}

555
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just when JoJo was about to drown...

556
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.
{\ O (spread): Joe John}

557
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It was Danny!
{\ O (spread): The joy of being there}

558
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

559
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.
{\ O (spread): The wind is a little sweet}

560
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.
{\ O (rank): Joe John}

561
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,600
That’s when JoJo truly
became friends with him.
{\ O (spread): Elna}

562
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
Is that so?
{\ O (rank): I'm short of words}

563
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
M’lord.
{\ O (spread): These feelings are overflowing}

564
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Eh? Ah, that’s right.

565
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:20,480
Friends...

566
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,440
Erina!

567
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,840
JoJo!

568
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,000
The two met once more!

569
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,880
Love! That wonderful curiosity
that guided JoJo’s actions.

570
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,560
JoJo was instantly
head over heels for her.

571
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Danny!

572
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Come boy!

573
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Oh, you’re so clever to eat
the fruit but not the core.

574
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?

575
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
Huh? It’s nothing.

576
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
What are you hiding?
{\ O (spread): My hands}

577
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
It’s nothing interesting.

578
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!

579
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,480
You’ll just laugh!

580
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I won’t laugh.

581
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
You’ll tell people!

582
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
I won’t tell, so show me!

583
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
I told you, no!

584
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
JoJo!

585
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,920
Oh, my!
{\ O (spread): It's already this late}

586
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,960
<i>Erina, just saying your
name makes me feel at ease</i>
{\ O (spread): Because a customer is coming today}

587
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,000
<i>Any musician would fall
in love with its melody</i>

588
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,040
<i>It puts me in such a good mood</i>
{\ O (spread): Elna}

589
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh!
{\ O (spread): see you tomorrow}

590
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,880
<i>To be laughing like this</i>

591
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,580
<i>There’s nothing but blue skies
here in vibrant Liverpool</i>

592
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,280
<i>Erina</i>
{\ O (spread): That name of yours}

593
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,880
<i>JoJo</i>
{\ O (rank): Jonathan Joestar}

594
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,080
<i>Our happiness is right here</i>
{\ O (spread): Erina Pendleton}

595
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,280
<i>The clouds are proud, and
the wind’s a little sweet</i>

596
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,480
<i>JoJo</i>

597
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>Erina</i>

598
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,080
<i>There aren’t enough words</i>

599
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,080
<i>For these ever overflowing feelings</i>

600
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:15,446
<i>I want to hear your voice
say, “it makes me happy”</i>

601
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:21,812
<i>That would be so
embarrassing, you—</i>

602
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:28,178
<i>Scoundrel!</i>
{\ O (spread): I did it}

603
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:34,544
<i>I don’t know why, but I’m drawn to you</i>

604
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:40,910
<i>Then find a reason,
let’s make it our reason!</i>

605
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:47,280
<i>Your hand,</i>

606
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,880
<i>My hand,</i>

607
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:57,980
<i>When they’re apart I feel so lost</i>

608
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:06,080
<i>It gives me a little courage
to move forward to tomorrow</i>

609
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:14,180
<i>Our hearts are resonating,
beating in time</i>
{\ O (spread): Not yet}

610
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:22,280
<i>Drawing us together, these
fleeting feelings surround us</i>
{\ O (spread): My first partner wasn't JoJo.}

611
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,080
It’s already this late!
{\ O (rank): This is Dio}

612
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,280
We have a guest coming
tonight, I have to hurry home.

613
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Erina!

614
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,280
I’ll see you tomorrow!

615
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,530
Yes, JoJo!

616
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,780
Danny!
{\ O (spread): Are you deliberately washing it with mud?}

617
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,030
<i>The one I’m so strongly
drawn to, his name is...</i>
{\ O (spread): Are you stupid?}

618
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>Jonathan Joestar</i>
{\ O (spread): What are you sleeping for?}

619
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,530
Hey!
{\ O (spread): Why did they give me alcohol?}

620
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,780
You’re Erina Pendleton, right?

782
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:46,500
So that I can take everything from him!

783

However...

784
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What’s that noise?
{\ O (rank): I came from Italy in pursuit of the Stone Mask.}

785
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Could someone be
inside the incinerator?
{\ O (spread): All the way from Italy?}

786
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Are they trying to get out?!
{\ O (rank): I think they said he was a northern aristocrat.}

787
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,500
Ah, it burns!
{\ O (spread): I'm just going to check the ledger,}

788

Danny!!

789
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Oh my god...
{\ O (gap): Gratz.}

790
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Someone! Someone please help!

00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
<i>Population increasing to
the point of overflowing</i>
{\ O (rank): It mists.}

{\ O (spread): Thank you for watching.}

795

<i>In the middle of this
unstoppable flow, agitation rages</i>

796
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,250
<i>The height of development,
the growth of British culture</i>

797
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,000
<i>But what goes up, must come
down. It’s only natural</i>

798
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,750
<i>That the top runners are being singled out</i>

799
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:21,500
<i>London’s peace has one
of its fingers broken</i>
{\ O (spread): Something is wrong. People are swaying in the river and being carried away.}

<i>Chaotic days mix the old and the new</i>
{\ O (spread): Give me a warmth Kisaki Jack}

801
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,000
<i>The map of London
paints a stark contrast</i>
{\ O (spread): Hate the poor, hate the rich,}

{\ O (rank): Let's all gather here now, Jack.}

803
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
<i>Put the focus on the

{\ O (spread): In 1887, the Trafalda pair raised their voices in equality.}

<i>The curtain of swaying inequality</i>

805

You’re... You’re certain,
that it was the Stone Mask?

807
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The one excavated from Mexico?

808
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
From Mexico, you say?

809
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It was quite a while ago...

810
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
A while?! Could you please clarify?

811
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yes, I’m <i>certain</i>, sir.

812
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,

813
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And bought it from me at a high price—

814
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yes!! Finally! I found it!

815
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Now, where could I find this gentleman—

816
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Wait a minute!

817

is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.
{\ O (spread): Jo Jo! That was amazing!}

820

All the way from Italy?!
{\ O (rank): Maa Jo Jo!}

822

Yes.
{\ O (spread): Hey! Can I write about your friendship in the school newspaper?}

823
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...
{\ O (gap): Thank you. Please go ahead and change and wait for me. Let's go home together.}

824
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,666

Just a little word of warning...

The sun will be setting soon.
{\ O (gap): Seven Years of Prefectural Production}

828
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.
{\ O (rank): You were beautiful and sincere}

829
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Wait a minute!
{\ O (gap): I straighten my collar, thinking of my friend}

830
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,375
I don’t trust you...
{\ O (spread): You regretted your mistake of not wearing your collar.}

831

Who the hell are you anyway?
{\ O (spread): In place of Tani, you supported me}

832

I apologise. My name
is Zeppeli, and I’m a baron.

833
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,500
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.
{\ O (spread): We walked together for seven years}

All the way from Italy?!
{\ O (spread): But why don't I feel any friendship towards you?}

835
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,250
Yes.
{\ O (spread): How are you feeling thanks?}

836
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,625
Wait, he said he was
a nobleman from up north...
{\ O (spread): Just the wind has come this far}

837
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,000
I’ll go check in the books!
{\ O (spread): If this is taking so long, I'm getting old.}

838
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Thank you.
{\ O (gap): It's still today}

839

Just a little word of warning...

That was magnificent!
{\ O (spread): Can you endure it, Tia?}

It was all thanks to your pass!
{\ O (spread): Your blood flows through my body in this hell}

Right, JoJo?

908
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:05,065
Uh-huh.

Dio!

910
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Can we write about your friendship

911
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,900
Thanks!

How are you feeling?
{\ O (gap): Let me check this medicine}

927
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:51,766
Well, I’m old enough now that
a mere cold can last a long time.
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

928
00:54:51,766 --> 00:55:01,132
Sir, you’re not that old yet!
{\ O (spread): To examine this drug}

929
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:10,500
Ah, well! I’ve got some big news for you!
{\ O (spread): to doubt our friendship}

930
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,500
JoJo and Dio Brando, they...
{\ O (gap): Tia}

931
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,000
Seem to have won!
{\ O (spread): I swear to you in all sincerity and on the honor of your father, Mr. Brand.}

932
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Ah, Dio is a proper member
of the Joestar family now!
{\ O (gap): My own innocence}

933
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,500
And JoJo has become
a splendid gentleman.
{\ O (rank): I swear to my father I'll never talk about this again}

934
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,500
His recent archaeology thesis is superb!
{\ O (spread): I swear to him}

935
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,500
And Dio is projected to graduate
top of his class in law school.

936
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I...

937
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
I admire you! Back then—

938
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,000
My lord!

939
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,500
Yes?

940
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I’m home!

941
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,000
Dio! Welcome back!
Ah, and JoJo as well!
{\ O (spread): I swear to you, Tia}

942
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,500
Father!

943
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Are you alright?
{\ O (rank): Give me back that medicine}

944
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I can’t get rid of this cough...

945
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Today, the doctor recommended
I be admitted to hospital.
{\ O (rank): I won't let you near my father anymore.}

946
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,000
I object!
{\ O (spread): Changed to the core}

947
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,500
These days, hospitals
only care about profits!
{\ O (spread): We never had a friendship from the start}

948
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,500
They say it’s a problem in London too.
{\ O (rank): I will protect JoJo}

949
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,500
It’s true...
{\ O (spread): It's a misunderstanding, JoJo}

950
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,500
I feel safer at home.
{\ O (rank): It's a misunderstanding}

951
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,300
I give in.
{\ O (spread): And}

952
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,100
The shaky hands and chest pain,
they’ll likely get better before long.
{\ O (spread): There's no evidence.}

953
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,900
Enough of that. You two...
Congratulations on your victory!
{\ O (spread): It's just a guess}

954
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,700
What?!
{\ O (spread): yes}

955
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,500
What?!
{\ O (spread): I hated my father}

956
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
You already know?
{\ O (gap): Above all, I was suspicious}

957
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:33,500
How?

958
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
Inspector Archer here told me.
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

959
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,500
How rude of you, inspector!
{\ O (rank): JoJo}

960
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,000
Huh?

961
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,500
We...
{\ O (spread): What did you do, Tia?}

962
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,500
We wanted to see Father’s face light up...
{\ O (rank): no}

963
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,500
So we rushed home!

964
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Oh no, silly me!

965
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,500
I truly am proud.

966
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,500
I have such wonderful sons.

967
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Especially you, Dio.

968
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,000
You’ve worked so very hard.
{\ O (spread): father}

969
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,500
Feel free to do whatever
you like after graduation.
{\ O (spread): What's going on, JoJo?}

970
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,000
I was born poor...

971
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,500
But you gave me a chance.
{\ O (spread): father}

972
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
Thank you.
{\ O (rank): I'm going to London for a couple of days.}

973
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Well then, I’ll be off.
{\ O (spread): Meanwhile, the doctors I hired}

974
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.

975
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,500
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.
{\ O (spread): Except from them}

976
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,500
But this is Liverpool!
{\ O (rank): Please do not take this as medicine or tia.}

977
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Well then, I’ll be off.

978
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,166
Inspector, thank you for always visiting.
{\ O (spread): Let me do what I want}

979
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:54,832
I have a busy night ahead of me, with
the likes of Jack the Ripper out there.
{\ O (spread): I don't know why}

980
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:59,498
But this is Liverpool!

981
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:04,164
There are men like him without
any humanity everywhere.

982
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:08,830
Now, if you’ll pardon me.
{\ O (spread): father}

983
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:13,500
The spring mechanism only reacts to blood...
{\ O (spread): thank you}

984
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Who on earth made this...
{\ O (gap): 7 years ago}

985
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
And for what reason?

986
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,500
If I solved this riddle, it might cause a
sensation in the archaeology department.
{\ O (spread): It reacted to my blood and activated}

987
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,500
If that happened, this mask that my
mother bought would have a fate of its own.

988
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:39,500
This is...

989
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Dario Brando?

990
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,750
Thank you again, Master Dio—

991
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh, it’s the least I could do.

992
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,250
Thank you. I’m getting too old for this.
{\ O (spread): Aiming for the end of the world, East End of London}

993
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,500
“Right now... I’m sick.”
{\ O (spread): This place I followed is in the mud}

994
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
“I’ll probably die.”
{\ O (gap): Augustus Golito, where the plague comes}

995
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,700
“My heart hurts,”
{\ O (spread): This place in front of me is the other side of the world}

996
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,900
“My hands shake,”
{\ O (spread): There's a reason we need to move forward}

997
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,100
“And I can’t stop coughing.”
{\ O (spread): Even if you lose this right hand, look at the stars}

998
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,300
<i>Dio...</i>

999
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,500
<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): This is me and the smell}

1000
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:22,500
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

1001
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,500
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

1002
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
<i>Mum died and left me alone</i>

1003
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:36,500
<i>Yes, alone with that piece of shit!</i>

1004
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,500
<i>I endured no matter what</i>

1005
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,500
<i>Yes, until the day finally came</i>

1006
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,540
Bloody hell! Ever since that wench
died I’ve been crumbling in debt!

1007
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,580
I know!

1008
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:56,620
You pawn this crap and bring
me back some booze instead!

1009
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,660
<i>My one and only memento of mum</i>

1010
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,700
<i>You threw it away!
You wiped your feet with it!</i>

1011
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,000
I don’t bloody need it anymore!

1012
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>He’s the one who killed mum</i>

1013
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
<i>Everything’s been
taken away from me</i>

1014
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Are you bloody deaf, Dio?!

1015
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>

1016
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,454
<i>I’ll bury you and this damn curse</i>

1017
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:33,908
<i>I will take everything
into my own two hands!</i>

1018
01:00:33,908 --> 01:00:39,362
<i>I’ll stay on top, even to
the limits of my humanity</i>

1019
01:00:39,362 --> 01:00:44,816
<i>I will find the resolve, plan ahead,</i>

1020
01:00:44,816 --> 01:00:50,270
<i>And then, hiding behind a mask—</i>

1021
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:55,724
<i>Dario Brando, my wretched father</i>

1022
01:00:55,724 --> 01:01:01,178
<i>May you rot in hell,
together with the past</i>

1023
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:06,632
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

1024
01:01:06,632 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): I don't mind losing this finger}

1025
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:17,540
Dio!

1026
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:23,000
What’s that in your hand? Medicine?

1027
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What’s the matter, JoJo?

1028
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I found this letter from your
father, from seven years ago.

1029
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It details your father’s symptoms
at the time of his death.

1030
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Huh?

1031
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Show me that.

1032
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
They’re the same symptoms as my father’s.

1033
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Are you always the one who
brings Father his medicine?

1034
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What is this non—

1035
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Answer me!

1036
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What on earth are
you trying to say?!

1037
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I’m going to have this
medicine investigated.

1038
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
JoJo...

1039
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you doubt the validity
of that medicine,

1040
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Then you doubt our very friendship.

1041
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Dio,

1042
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
As a gentleman,

1043
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I ask you to swear your innocence on
your father’s honour and the Brando name.
{\ O (spread): I came here for my father.}

1044
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
If you can swear on your father’s honour,
{\ O (spread): That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.}

1045
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I’ll never speak of this again.

1046
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Swear on that guy?

1047
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Dio,

1048
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Swear on it.

1049
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Swear on that guy?
{\ O (rank): That's why Kelsion doesn't want to do anything that would cause your father grief.}

1050
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,500
Dio,
{\ O (spread): Tell me your name.}

1051
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,000
Swear on it.
{\ O (spread): Jora, Joestar.}

1052
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,500
DIO: Swear on it?
JOJO: Come on, swear on it!
{\ O (spread): Joestar-san, please name the person playing the German role.}

1053
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,000
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Swear on it now!
{\ O (spread): Be careful. They're tricky. Hey, treat your wounds.}

1054
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,500
DIO: Swear...
JOJO: Can you swear on it, Dio?!
{\ O (spread): This Speed ​​Burgon will guide you to Minsei.}

1055
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,000
That scum has never had any
honour for me to swear on!
{\ O (spread): Why?}

1056
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Give me the medicine back!
{\ O (gap): I like you.}

1057
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I won’t ever let you go
near my father again!
{\ O (rank): Foca Street}

1058
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I’m convinced now...
{\ O (spread): O man of resolve,}

1059
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That there was never any
friendship between us to begin with!
{\ O (spread): Foca Street}

1060
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I’ll protect the Joestar family.
{\ O (gap): Continue taking a look}

1061
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is all a
misunderstanding, JoJo!
{\ O (rank): You who see the stars in your heart}

1062
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Just a misunderstanding...

1063
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,666
Besides...

1064
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,332
It’s not like you have
any proof, do you?
{\ O (spread): Light up the darkness}

1065
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:08,000
Nothing more than a flimsy theory.

1066
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yes,

1067
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,666
I despised my father, hated
him more than anything.

1068
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,332
I just lost my temper when
you started suspecting me...

1069
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:18,000
JoJo! JoJo!!

1070
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
JoJo...

1071
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
JoJo! JoJo!!

1072
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
JoJo...

1073
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Is something the matter, Master Dio?

1074
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
No...

1075
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,600
I’m alright...

1076
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,200
<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>

1077
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,800
It’s too late to turn back now.

1078
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,400
<i>A world where everything is perfect,</i>

1079
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,000
<i>In the palm of your hand, Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): I can't help but drink alcohol}

1080
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Father!
{\ O (rank): Can't you hear my voice?}

1081
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
What’s going on, Young Master JoJo?!
{\ O (rank): A voice calling you}

1082
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-Father!
{\ O (gap): Shut up and don't come out}

1083

What’s all this ruckus for?
{\ O (spread): You are the only one who can see the sun}

1084

Father...
{\ O (spread): Become the richest}

1085
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I’m going to London
for two or three days.
{\ O (gap): The case is different between you and me}

1086
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
While I’m gone, take only what the
doctors and nurses I’ve hired give you.
{\ O (spread): Where am I looking, Tanchiki?}

1087
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Please don’t accept any care

{\ O (rank): Nyahaha are you listening to this?}

1088
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,500
Excuse me, but—

1089
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,000
We’ll do as he says.
{\ O (spread): When you go out,}

1090
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don’t know what’s going on...
{\ O (rank): Can't you hear my voice?}

1091
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Father...
{\ O (rank): Can't you hear my voice?}

1092
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,000

We’ll do as he says.

1097
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I don’t know what’s going on...

1098
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But I trust my son!
{\ O (spread): I'll kill you}

1099
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Thank you, Father.
{\ O (gap): A voice calling someone}

1100
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Seven years ago, this thing...
{\ O (spread): It's an interesting machine}

1101
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It moved in reaction to my blood.
{\ O (gap): Hey you idiot}

1102
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,857
With this...

1103
01:04:44,857 --> 01:04:54,714
I’ll make it appear as if he had
an accident during his research.

Your own research...
{\ O (spread): I'll solve your research}

1106
01:05:14,428 --> 01:05:24,285
Will be the death of you!
{\ O (spread): What}

1107
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:34,142
<i>Time’s nearly out, so I gathered
my resolve and took off!</i>
{\ O (spread): What}

1108
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:44,000
<i>Turning my eyes to the stars
and praying for an antidote</i>

1109
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
<i>I headed for the fringe of
society, the East End of London</i>
{\ O (rank): Hallucination?}

1110
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
<i>Now I’ve arrived here
in this town steeped in mud</i>
{\ O (spread): Dead}

1111
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
<i>Ogre Street, the place
where plagues are born</i>
{\ O (spread): If you get stabbed in the head with this much force, it's only natural that you'll die instantly.}

1112
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
<i>Before my eyes lies
the underbelly of society</i>
{\ O (spread): It's an ancient instrument of torture and murder.}

1113
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>But I have a reason why I must move forward</i>
{\ O (rank): Not dead}

1114

<i>Even if I were to lose
this right hand of mine</i>
{\ O (rank): Hiba, what is this guy?}

1115
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,200
<i>I’ll look to the stars!</i>

1116
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:08,400
<i>At long last our meeting takes place</i>

1117
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:08,600
<i>There’s a scent in the air
and it smells like prey</i>

1118
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:08,800
<i>Sniffing you out through the
storm someone’s making his way</i>

1119
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,000
<i>It’s time for your
leader to take the stage</i>

1120
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,200
<i>(Ogre Street, we devour anything we can)</i>
{\ O (spread): I hate that the sun I see is the last one I see!}

<i>(Ogre Street, here everything meets its end)</i>
{\ O (spread): Thank goodness...}

1122
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:09,600
<i>Dunno what the hell
you came here for</i>
{\ O (spread): Did the sunlight turn it to ash?}

1123
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:09,800
<i>Bet you thought you
stood a good chance, huh?</i>

1124
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,000
<i>In a moment we’ll
devour all that hope</i>

1125
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
<i>This is Ogre Street and
we’re the ogres, duh!</i>

1126
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
<i>Got no problem with you bein’ naïve,

<i>Want a taste of the

<i>Us have-nots are gonna
steal your riches away!</i>

1132

<i>From your life to that foolish

<i>Tail between your legs, you can
save your own skin by runnin’ away!</i>

<i>I came here for a reason!</i>
{\ O (spread): yes!}

1139
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:30,845
<i>You said you’re fine with
losing four fingers, hah?</i>
{\ O (spread): Hahahaha...}

1140
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:36,460
<i>(Ogre Street, why don’t we
put that resolve to the test?)</i>
{\ O (spread): Hahahaha...}

1141
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:42,075
Hold on! I only came here
looking for a poison seller!
{\ O (spread): long…}

1142
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:47,690
Quit bluffin’! Let me have a
go at this soft little rich boy!

1143
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:53,305
That’s the sound of blade hitting bone!
{\ O (spread): This is my fault...}

1144
01:07:53,305 --> 01:07:58,920
<i>Made the mistake of my life, pickin’
a fight with this fearless tough guy</i>

<i>Three, two, one!</i>

1147
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,765
Stop, everyone!
{\ O (spread): Dio's father, Dario Brando...}

1148
01:08:15,765 --> 01:08:21,380
I, Speedwagon, won’t allow you
to lay a hand on that gentleman!
{\ O (spread): That is what I mean.}

1149
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:27,000
Why didn’t you kick me
with your full strength?
{\ O (spread): I'll tell you}

1150
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I came here for the sake of my father.
{\ O (rank): It's a story from when you were a baby}

1151
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So in the moment I kicked,
{\ O (spread): Yes, this is my ring}

1152
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.
{\ O (gap): But no theft report was filed.}

1153
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.
{\ O (gap): A man was arrested for trying to put a ring into the seventh}

1154
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Tell me your name!
{\ O (gap): The ring was given to Sir Joster when he was betrothed to his wife.}

1155
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Jonathan Joestar.
{\ O (rank): It was clear that this was a special pairing.}

1156
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,333
Mr. Joestar, if you’re looking
for poison, that’d be Wang Chan.
{\ O (spread): Yes, this is the ring I made with my wife.}

1157
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,666
Be careful, he’s a crafty one!
{\ O (spread): Did you remember your wife today?}

1158
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,000
Someone bandage his wound.
{\ O (spread): He had tears in his eyes.}

1159
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I, Speedwagon, will lead you to his shop!

1160
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why?!
{\ O (rank): Would you like to see me?}

1161
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
‘Cause I’ve taken a liking to ya!

{\ O (spread): Got it}

1164

01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,846
<i>Your refreshing sunlight</i>
{\ O (spread): Dario Brando is no lifesaver or anything.}

1169
01:09:49,846 --> 01:09:55,692
<i>Brought me completely to my knees</i>
{\ O (spread): He's just a thief}

1170
01:09:55,692 --> 01:10:01,538
<i>This must be some
strange twist of fate!</i>
{\ O (spread): Sir Joster knew that.}

1171
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:07,384
<i>Let’s toast—to our meeting!</i>

01:10:07,384 --> 01:10:13,230
JoJo...

<i>Dio...</i>

1175

JoJo has gone off to London...
{\ O (spread): This ring was given to me}

1176
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:36,614
Could he have died a dog’s death already?
{\ O (spread): Yes, I said}

1177

<i>Dio...</i>

1178
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:48,306
Or could he have found
evidence of the medicine?
{\ O (spread): It's not a lie}

1179
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:54,152
Which is it?!
{\ O (spread): This is what I gave to him}

<i>Dio...</i>
{\ O (spread): He is innocent}

1187
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,500
-You piece of shit, we’re not the same!

How dare you! You bastard!
{\ O (spread): Maybe so}

1199

01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): - Just like back then.}

1223
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
JoJo!

1224
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,500
I’ll find the answer to your
research myself right now!
{\ O (spread): - A smashed grass fire.}

1225
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:24,000
{\an8}<i>Dio Dio Dio Dio Dio!</i>
{\ O (spread): - That sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean}

1226
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
What...

1227
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
What—

1228
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,000
{\an8}<i>[AZTEC CHANTING]</i>
{\ O (spread): - I'm fascinated by the world of roads.}

1229
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What is this light?
{\ O (gap): - My respected father,}

1230
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Was I hallucinating?
{\ O (rank): - Crossed the seven seas.}

1231
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
He’s dead...
{\ O (rank): - Dear Father and Mother,}

1232
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,500
The spikes pierced so deep into his skull,
it must have killed him instantly.

1233
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,000
This mask is just some ancient
sacrificial torture device.
{\ O (spread): - The Stone Mask is from my hand,}

1234
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
He’s not dead!

1235
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Fangs?! What is he?!

1236
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,250
<i>I’m thirsty, thirsty, so thirsty!</i>

1237
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:09,500
He’s sucking my blood!

1238
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:17,750
His face is...

1239
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:26,000
Becoming younger?!
{\ O (spread): -There's a saying that goes, "That's who he is."}

1240
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,860
I don’t want the morning sun
to be the last thing I ever see!

1241
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:43,930
I was saved...

1242
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:56,000
By the sunlight...

1243
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:05,000
He turned into ash...

1244
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,500
Ow!

1245
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:24,000
So this...

1246
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is the power of the Stone Mask.
{\ O (rank): - Did you come back from London?}

1247
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So this...

1248
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,750
Is the power of the Stone Mask.

1249
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,500
So, where is Dio?

1250
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,250
It seems he hasn’t come
home since last night.

1251
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,000
I’ll call for reinforcements right away.
{\ O (spread): - I understand, girl.}

1252
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Please use the foyer.
{\ O (gap): - That's the kind of guy you are.}

1253
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Thank you.
{\ O (rank): - I know this is selfish, but I have a favor to ask.}

1254
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
-You there!
-Sir!
{\ O (spread): - This is the last one.}

1255
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
This Asian fellow,
Wang Chan—take him away.
{\ O (spread): - Can you give me some time?}

1256
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Yes sir!
{\ O (rank): - To the police,}

1257
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,333
Oi, come on!
{\ O (spread): - Time for independence.}

1258
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:49,666
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): - I,}

1259
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:53,000
I apologise.

1260
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This is my cross to bear.

1261
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:55,066
What?

1262
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:55,132
If only I had made sure
that man was exiled...

1263
01:14:55,132 --> 01:14:55,198
Dio’s father...

1264
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:55,264
Dario Brando.

1265
01:14:55,264 --> 01:14:55,330
What do you mean?
{\ O (spread): - Don't believe it.}

1266
01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:55,396
I’ll tell you about it.
{\ O (spread): - His words.}

1267
01:14:55,396 --> 01:14:55,462
This happened when you were a baby.

1268
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:55,528
This is certainly my ring,

1269
01:14:55,528 --> 01:14:55,594
But I never reported a theft.
{\ O (spread): - Let me introduce myself.}

1270
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:55,660
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.
{\ O (spread): - I'm Speed ​​Oagon, the busybody.}

1271
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:55,726
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1272
01:14:55,726 --> 01:14:55,792
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1273
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:55,858
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.

1274
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:55,924
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,

1275
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,000
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1276
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I...
{\ O (rank): - This guy is born evil.}

1277
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,300
Dario Brando.

1278
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,200
What do you mean?

1279
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:05,265
I’ll tell you about it.

1280
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:05,330
This happened when you were a baby.

1281
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:05,395
This is certainly my ring,
{\ O (spread): My son}

1282
01:15:05,395 --> 01:15:05,460
But I never reported a theft.

1283
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:05,525
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.
{\ O (spread): I was born with that fate}

1284
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:05,590
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1285
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,655
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1286
01:15:05,655 --> 01:15:05,720
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.
{\ O (spread): Be careful why}

1287
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:05,785
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,
{\ O (spread): Got it}

1288
01:15:05,785 --> 01:15:05,850
Tears welled up in his eyes.
{\ O (spread): I'll put the handcuffs on}

1289
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:05,915
I...
{\ O (spread): Humans have limitations}

1290
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:05,980
I arrested the criminal!
{\ O (spread): I've figured it out}

1291
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,045
Would you like to see for yourself?
{\ O (spread): The more Oro blooms, the more}

1292
01:15:06,045 --> 01:15:06,110
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.
{\ O (spread): The limits of life}

1293
01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:06,175
He’s certain to be exiled!

1294
01:15:06,175 --> 01:15:06,240
I see.

1295
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:06,305
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1296
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:06,370
Brando?!

1297
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:06,435
Oh, bollocks.

1298
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:06,500
Then that means—
{\ O (spread): My eyes are closed}

1299
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:06,565
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,
{\ O (spread): Do you understand that murky sky?}

1300
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:06,630
But a thief!
{\ O (spread): These hands are crushing me, they can't reach me}

1301
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,695
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.
{\ O (spread): This beautiful blood that has been JoJo}

1302
01:15:06,695 --> 01:15:06,760
Why?
{\ O (spread): Even after vomiting, this blood won't go away}

1303
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:06,825
I...
{\ O (spread): So now is the time to break this cage}

1304
01:15:06,825 --> 01:15:06,900
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.
{\ O (spread): Catch the Stars}

1305
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,500
Did he tell you...
{\ O (rank): And I}

1306
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,700
This happened when you were a baby.
{\ O (rank): Mother}

1307
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,000
This is certainly my ring,

1308
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,933
But I never reported a theft.
{\ O (spread): I'm quitting}

1309
01:15:22,933 --> 01:15:26,866
I arrested the man who
was caught pawning it.
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

1310
01:15:26,866 --> 01:15:30,800
Lord Joestar had that ring specially made
as a pair for his and his wife’s engagement.

1311
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,900
It was obvious that it was stolen!

1312
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,700
Yes, it’s the ring I had made with my wife.
{\ O (rank): Shoot}

1313
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:46,600
When Lord Joestar thought about his wife,
{\ O (spread): Shoot}

1314
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,200
Tears welled up in his eyes.

1315
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,350
I...
{\ O (spread): JoJo}

1316
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,500
I arrested the criminal!
{\ O (spread): Hey, doctor, call a doctor}

1317
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,000
Would you like to see for yourself?

1318
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,100
Stealing from a noble is a heavy offence.

1319
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,700
He’s certain to be exiled!

1320
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:03,300
I see.

1321
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,900
Here he is! Oi! Wake up! Brando!

1322
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Brando?!
{\ O (rank): Not bad}

1323
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,100
Oh, bollocks.
{\ O (spread): Gradually, the end came in my son's arms.}

1324
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,300
Then that means—
{\ O (spread): Oh my god}

1325
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,900
Dario Brando isn’t some saviour,
{\ O (rank): It was definitely a mistake back then}

1326
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,600
But a thief!
{\ O (gap): When you die, everything}

1327
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:22,500
Even knowing this,
Lord Joestar adopted Dio.
{\ O (spread): Damn it, Mr. Joestar}

1328
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,200
Why?
{\ O (rank): I was always told to be sincere.}

1329
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:23,700
I...
{\ O (spread): Always proudly}

1330
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,100
I was moved to tears by
what Lord Joestar said next.
{\ O (rank): I said I'd save you}

1331
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:34,500
Did he tell you...
{\ O (spread): I was told I believed}

1332
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:40,900
That I gave him this ring?
{\ O (spread): I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you}

1333
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,700
Yes, he said that. A lie!
{\ O (gap): What is sincerity?}

1334
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,800
It’s not a lie.
{\ O (rank): Dad, open your chest}

1335
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,100
This is what I gave him.
{\ O (gap): What are you proud of?}

1336
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,500
He is innocent.
{\ O (rank): What's the purpose}

1337
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,300
But it’s a memento of your wife!
{\ O (rank): The Joestar blood that flows through my body}

1338
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,400
Mr. Brando,
{\ O (gap): Always remained sincere}

1339
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,800
This is yours.
{\ O (gap): Be proud and understand yourself}

1340
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,100
With this ring, please buy
what you need for your family.
{\ O (rank): Ready to cut through the dark wilderness}

1341
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
Lord Joestar! Are you taking the piss?!
{\ O (gap): Look up at the stars and accept it all}

1342
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:15,200
<i>If I were suffering from poverty</i>
{\ O (rank): Engrave this will in your mind}

1343
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,700
<i>I would have done the same
thing, yes, for the ones I love</i>
{\ O (rank): Be proud of your heart and shine golden}

1344
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,700
<i>When the stars in the sky
shine, they start to tell a story</i>
{\ O (rank): Let's become the future and send it to the stars}

1345
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,200
<i>Let’s pray that this light
will illuminate the darkness</i>
{\ O (rank): The Joestar blood that flows through my body}

1346
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
Thank you, sir!
{\ O (rank): Everything is connected and everything has meaning}

1347
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,000
You are too good-natured!
{\ O (gap): Resisting this fate and sadness}

1348
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,900
This scumbag will laugh at
you tomorrow morning!
{\ O (spread): A single drop of courage}

1349
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,800
That may be true,
{\ O (spread): Police work is tough}

1350
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
But think about it the other way around.
{\ O (rank): what up}

1351
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:26,800
<i>From the prison called fate,
people reach for the stars</i>
{\ O (rank): That's the corpse}

1352
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,800
<i>Let’s embrace that courage,
that loneliness,</i>
{\ O (rank): Dio's body is missing}

1353
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,800
<i>That pain</i>
{\ O (spread): What?}

1354
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:46,800
<i>Everything is connected</i>
{\ O (rank): Police Officer, get away from the window.}

1355
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:55,300
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>
{\ O (spread): What's up with this guy?}

1356
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:03,800
<i>I believe in humanity
and all of its resolve</i>
{\ O (spread): I'm back to life}

1357
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:12,300
I can’t see stars or nothin’!
That’s bollocks!
{\ O (spread): Even though I was shot so many times}

1358
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:20,800
That’s why...
{\ O (spread): Be careful}

1359
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:29,800
<i>I’ll keep on believing</i>

1360
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:35,000
<i>That this gold I’ve passed on</i>

1361
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,200
<i>Will shine one day</i>
{\ O (spread): Dio}

1362
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:45,400
<i>With all of my resolve...</i>
{\ O (spread): stop}

1363
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,600
<i>I will defy fate!</i>
{\ O (spread): Shoot me}

1364
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,800
Inspector.

1365
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
I’ll wait for Dio.

1366
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
He can still be stopped.

1367
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I heard a bizarre rumour on the streets.

1368
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It’s said that a vagabond shattered
a wall with his bare hands.

1369
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And then...
{\ O (spread): Can you hear me?}

1370
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
When the morning sun hit the man,
he turned to ashes and vanished.
{\ O (spread): you}

1371
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It’s the same as what
happened 30 years ago...
{\ O (rank): JoeJoe}

1372
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:54,000
<i>It’s a wedge driven into
the wasteland of my memory</i>
{\ O (spread): I am}

1373
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>
{\ O (rank): I have gained such great power}

1374
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:17,000
<i>Full of passion and yearning
for the unknown world</i>
{\ O (spread): From Stone Mask}

1375
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
<i>I crossed the seven seas
with my respected father</i>
{\ O (rank): Your father's power}

1376
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:21,076
<i>My beloved father, the voices
of my friends, my youth</i>

1377
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:21,152
<i>The Stone Mask took
everything away from me</i>
{\ O (spread): Run, Mr. Josser.}

1378
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,228
<i>I swore I’d get revenge,
that I’d take it all back</i>

1379
01:21:21,228 --> 01:21:21,304
<i>Maybe not today, but
there’s always tomorrow</i>

1380
01:21:21,304 --> 01:21:21,380
<i>Yes, tomorrow...</i>

1381
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:21,456
“A man is what he thinks
about all day long.”
{\ O (spread): It's no wonder that God has lost some unknown ability from his brain.}

1382
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:21,532
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1383
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:21,608
The Stone Mask...
{\ O (spread): If you completely destroy the head}

1384
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:21,684
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.
{\ O (spread): Stop it}

1385
01:21:21,684 --> 01:21:21,760
I, Dio, was...

1386
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:21,836
Shit...

1387
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:21,912
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): It's stronger}

1388
01:21:21,912 --> 01:21:22,000
I see you’ve returned from London—

1389
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I have the antidote now.

1390
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
The Stone Mask...

1391
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
There’s a saying that goes like that.

1392
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:08,600
The Stone Mask...

1393
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:16,200
If I don’t find it, I can’t
recover what I’ve lost.
{\ O (spread): I still don't know how far I can go!}

1394
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:23,800
I, Dio, was...
{\ O (spread): JoeJoe}

1395
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:31,400
Shit...
{\ O (spread): Oh, JoJo}

1396
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:39,000
JoJo...
{\ O (spread): Stop your pointless struggle}

1397
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I see you’ve returned from London—
{\ O (rank): I told you!}

1398
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,600
I have the antidote now.
{\ O (spread): The more you try to come up with a plan, the more you realize there are limitations to what humans can do.}

1399
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,200
It’s a shame it had
to come to this, Dio.
{\ O (spread): Don't hide in the shadows of the curtains, come out}

1400
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,800
It truly hurts me.
{\ O (spread): You too will become my life!}

1401
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,400
Although you might not believe me,
{\ O (spread): Dion! It's not strategy that will stop you, it's courage!}

1402
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,000
Those are my true feelings.
{\ O (spread): You can't defeat him this day, Speedwagon, you run from the mansion!}

1403
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I understand, JoJo.
{\ O (gap): Joestar-san! Don't run away to the top!}

1404
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:14,000
You’re honest like that.
{\ O (spread): The running flames illuminate the darkness}

1405
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Although it’s selfish,
I have a favour to ask—

1406
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
The final one
I will ask of you.

1407
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Can you give me more time?

1408
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Time—
{\ O (spread): I will end you, your power, here}

1409
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
To turn myself in to the police.
{\ O (gap): It's no use, it's no use! Let's suck the life out of it}

1410
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Eh?
{\ O (spread): Flickering flames, don't let them fall!}

1411
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I...
{\ O (gap): Let's offer light to the other side!}

1412
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,400
R-Regret the choices I’ve
made throughout my life.
{\ O (spread): After you gave me your power}

1413
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:48,800
Because I was born into squalor...

1414
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:55,200
My ambition was relentless.
{\ O (spread): You were always on my back}

1415
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:01,600
What I did was terrible!
{\ O (spread): My youth is with you}

1416
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:08,000
I want to repent for my sins!
{\ O (spread): Settlement in this era}

1417
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Don’t believe a word he says!
{\ O (rank): Jojo, the Joestar mansion burns down}

1418
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I can see from your face that
you’re wondering who I am.
{\ O (spread): Under the map, everything is lost}

1419
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Allow me to introduce myself!
{\ O (gap): Burn everything except this life}

1420
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I’m Speedwagon, the meddler!
{\ O (gap): I'll finish you}

1421
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,400
Growing up in the darkest slums,
{\ O (spread): This is what Joestar must be thinking}

1422
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,800
I’ve met all sorts of horrible
people throughout my life.
{\ O (spread): The stronger the firepower, the more the monster's recovery power can't keep up.}

1423
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,200
So I can tell all I need to know
about a person just from their smell.
{\ O (spread): More, more firepower}

1424
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,600
This guy reeks!
{\ O (spread): But the flames have reached the roof}

1425
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,000
Worse than vomit!
{\ O (spread): Damn it, Mr. Joestar}

1426
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
He was born evil!

1427
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,782
Mr. Joestar, you should call
for the police right away.

1428
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:54,564
This man has confessed already.
{\ O (spread): This body is immortal, you are the only one who will die.}

1429
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:57,346
Father...
{\ O (spread): How the goddess of Jillary shines}

1430
01:24:57,346 --> 01:25:00,128
I’ve heard everything I need to.
{\ O (spread): Give me loving judgment in your heart}

1431
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:02,910
I will return to my bed to rest.
{\ O (spread): I won't let go of this knife}

1432
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:05,692
I don’t want to see my son
being taken away in handcuffs.
{\ O (spread): You're closed off, it's a knife.}

1433
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:08,474
You won’t succeed in arresting that man...
{\ O (spread): It's no use, I'm immortal}

1434
01:25:08,474 --> 01:25:11,256
He was born with an innate destiny.
{\ O (spread): Jillary}

1435
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:14,040
Silence!
{\ O (spread): The power of hell}

1436
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,880
Come on—
{\ O (rank): The Goddess of Giving Love Sways in Flames}

1437
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,320
He was born with an innate destiny.

1438
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,565
Silence!

1439
01:25:31,565 --> 01:25:33,810
Come on—

1440
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:36,055
JoJo, I understand!

1441
01:25:36,055 --> 01:25:38,300
Arrest me.

1442
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,545
But, if it’s not too much to ask;

1443
01:25:40,545 --> 01:25:42,790
I want you to be the
one who handcuffs me.

1444
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:45,040
For the sake of those seven
years we spent together.
{\ O (spread): I can hear you}

1445
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,720
Be careful!
{\ O (rank): in front}

1446
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,040
Agreed.

1447
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,240
I will handcuff you.
{\ O (rank): That is}

1448
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,640
<i>To be human is to have limits</i>

1449
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:08,140
<i>That’s what I’ve come to realise</i>

1450
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:13,640
<i>And still the more I try to plan,</i>

1451
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,640
<i>The more I see the limitations of this life</i>

1452
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,473
What’re you talking about?

1453
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:28,306
<i>You know, JoJo...</i>

1454
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:33,139
<i>This frustration, it’s unbearable</i>

1455
01:26:33,139 --> 01:26:37,972
<i>I’m always coming up empty-handed</i>

1456
01:26:37,972 --> 01:26:42,805
<i>This prison I’m trapped in,
it’s slathered in mud</i>

1457
01:26:42,805 --> 01:26:47,640
<i>I can’t see the stars, and no
matter how hard I struggle,</i>

1458
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
<i>My eyes are still blinded</i>

1459
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,140
<i>Don’t you get it?</i>

1460
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,640
<i>That murky sky up there,</i>

1461
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,640
<i>It’s crushing me!
I can’t reach up this way</i>

1462
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,640
<i>Yes, Joestar, even
your purest pedigree,</i>

1463
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,640
<i>Can’t wash the filth out of mine</i>

1464
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,640
<i>That’s why, now is the time</i>

1465
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:16,640
<i>To break free, from this cage</i>

1466
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:16,640
<i>And seize...</i>

1467
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,640
<i>The stars!</i>

1468
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,640
<i>And seize...</i>

1469
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:28,900
<i>The stars!</i>

1470
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,160
The Stone Mask?

1471
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:29,420
<i>I...</i>

1472
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:29,680
<i>I...</i>

1473
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:29,940
<i>Reject...</i>

1474
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,200
<i>My humanity!</i>

1475
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:30,460
<i>JoJo!</i>

1476
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:30,720
Stop!

1477
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:30,980
-JoJo!
-Father!

1478
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:31,240
Dio!

1479
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:31,500
Dio!

1480
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:31,760
Shoot him!

1481
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,020
Shoot him!

1482
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:32,280
Lord Joestar!

1483
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:32,540
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

1484
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:32,800

JoJo...

1486
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:33,320
This is...

1487
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:33,580
Your late mother’s ring.

1488
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:33,840
A doctor’s coming, he’ll save you! Hold on!

1489
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:34,100
Please... don’t blame Dio for this.

1490
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:34,360
Maybe... the fact that
I was so hard on you...

1491
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:34,640
Made him feel like I was
treating him differently.

1492
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Father...

1493
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,640

01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:51,640
Shoot him!

1500
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:51,640
Shoot him!

1501
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:51,640
Lord Joestar!

1502
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:51,640

Shoot him!

Shoot him!

1507
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,306
Lord Joestar!

1508
01:28:11,306 --> 01:28:11,972
Hey—a doctor! Call a doctor!

It’s not so bad...

01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:22,640
To die...

1533
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:47,640
In my son’s arms.

1534
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,140
Father?

1535
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,640
How could this be...

1536
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,640
I knew I made a mistake, back then.

1537
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,000
Now he’s dead and there’s
no bringing him back.

1538
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Mr. Joestar...

1539
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
<i>You always told me to be a gentleman</i>

1540
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:19,000
<i>To always live with pride</i>

1541
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
<i>Even though I said I’d save you,</i>

1542
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,333
<i>Even though you said you believed me!</i>

1543
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:37,666
<i>I couldn’t protect you—
How could I be so powerless?</i>

1544
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:44,000
<i>What does it mean
to be a gentleman?</i>

1545
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
<i>Father, open your eyes!</i>

1546
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
<i>What’s pride worth now?</i>

1547
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
<i>What’s the purpose of</i>

1548
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body?</i>

1549
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:10,000
<i>You always remained a
gentleman, until the very end</i>

1550
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:18,000
<i>Carrying yourself with
discipline and pride</i>

1551
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
<i>Your resolve to shine a beacon
through the dark wastelands</i>

1552
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:33,000
<i>I’ll accept it all, and
look up at the stars</i>

1553
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
<i>I’ll engrave your will into my soul</i>

1554
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:46,000
<i>Take pride in this heart
that shines like gold!</i>

1555
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
<i>It will become the future,
sent up to the stars</i>
{\ O (rank): I couldn't face you}

1556
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>

1557
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
<i>Everything is connected,
there’s a meaning to it all</i>

1558
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:15,000
<i>I’ll fight against this fate,
keep sorrow at bay</i>

1559
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
<i>With just one drop of courage!</i>

1560
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Inspector! It’s an emergency!

1561
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What’s wrong?

1562
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
The body... Dio’s body is gone!

1563
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000

1564
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000

1565
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000

1567
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
What the hell?! He came back to life!

1568
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Even though we shot him into Swiss cheese!

1569
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Be careful! He’s got some kind of weapon!

1570
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000

1571
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000

1572
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Shoot him! Don’t just
stand there! Quickly!

1573
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I don’t get it! I can’t make heads

Run away, Mr. Joestar!
You’ll only get killed!

1585

The brain!

1587
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That mask must have drawn out
an unknown power from his brain!

1588

Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1707
01:35:47,432 --> 01:35:47,464

This isn’t a “trick” I’m using to stop you!

1714
01:35:47,656 --> 01:35:47,688
It’s courage!

1715
01:35:47,688 --> 01:35:47,720
This fire won’t kill him.

1716
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:47,752
Speedwagon, escape from the mansion.

1717
01:35:47,752 --> 01:35:47,784
What?

1718
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:47,816
Mr. Joestar!

1719
01:35:47,816 --> 01:35:47,848

Stop this useless struggle of yours.

1739
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,400

{\ O (spread): The stars are attracted to each other}

1774
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Mr. Joestar was surely thinking,
{\ O (rank): Guided by the destiny I love}

1775
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:39,400
That a stronger fire could overpower
that demon’s healing ability.

1776
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,400
“If only the flames were
even hotter!” But by then...
{\ O (spread): I'm floating here}

1777
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:49,400
The fire had already engulfed the
mansion, even overtaking the roof.

01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Damn it! Mr. Joestar!

1779
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:33,400
This body is immortal.

<i>I won’t let go of this knife,</i>

Can you hear me?

01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,060
You can hear me.

01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:33,120
Good.

1799
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:33,180
I hope you had a nice intermission.

1800
01:41:33,180 --> 01:41:33,240
I’ve returned in order to
continue telling our story,

1801
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:33,300
Of the world to which all of
you have become witnesses.

1802
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:33,360
And so that we can continue our
<i>show</i> of love for these characters.

1803
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:33,420
I want the whole acrylic stand collection.

1804
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:33,480
Just a few more until it’s complete!

1805
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:33,540
I hope you get the merch
you’re looking for too.

1806
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:33,600
Well, let’s continue where we left off.

1807
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:33,660
The story up to this point
seems like a bit of a fairytale, but...

1808
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:33,720
Make no mistake, it’s the truth.

1809
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:33,780
Things are going to get more
and more bizarre from here on out.

1810
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:33,840
Yes.

1811
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:33,900
<i>Much</i> more bizarre.

1812
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:33,960
Previously, the mansion was
shrouded in flames and burnt down...

1813
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,020
But Mr. Joestar survived.

1814
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:34,080
He beat Dio,

1815
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,140
But lost everything.

1816
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:34,200
Three days later...

1817
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:34,260
I found it!

1818
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:34,320
The mask that man wore!

1819
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:34,380

01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000

This is my father’s hospital.

<i>The clouds are proud, and

lost my focus and fainted.

Fate? That’s right.

1904
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:23,797
Maybe some people are
just fated to meet one another.

1905
01:47:23,797 --> 01:47:25,768
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.

1906
01:47:25,768 --> 01:47:27,739
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

1907

<i>He’s struck again,

<i>(The plague of London,

But we might run
into Jack the Ripper!

1926
01:48:05,188 --> 01:48:07,159
It’s a terrifying thought!

1927
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:09,130
Terrifying, is it?

1928
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,101
It is!

Humans are bound by notions of virtue.

They fear that which is spectacularly evil.

1947

However, very rarely there are
those not constrained by goodness.

01:57:24,511 --> 01:57:25,022
<i>Yes, I know it all</i>

2214
01:57:25,022 --> 01:57:25,533
<i>They’re two sides of the same coin,
this breathing and the Stone Mask</i>

2215
01:57:25,533 --> 01:57:26,044
<i>So too are you and Dio!</i>

2216
01:57:26,044 --> 01:57:26,555
Dio!

2217
01:57:26,555 --> 01:57:27,066
Yes!

2218
01:57:27,066 --> 01:57:27,577
<i>The mask is not broken—he has it!</i>

2219
01:57:27,577 --> 01:57:28,088
<i>The man wearing the mask, Dio,
walks in the darkness even now!</i>

2220
01:57:28,088 --> 01:57:28,599
<i>I’ve travelled the world</i>

2221
01:57:28,599 --> 01:57:29,110
<i>Pursuing the mask</i>

2222
01:57:29,110 --> 01:57:29,621
<i>So that I can destroy it!</i>

2223
01:57:29,621 --> 01:57:30,132
Dio is alive?!

2224
01:57:30,132 --> 01:57:30,643
{\an8}<i>(Pow!)</i>

2225
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:31,154
<i>We must fight!</i>

2226
01:57:31,154 --> 01:57:31,665
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

2227
01:57:31,665 --> 01:57:32,176
<i>We must destroy it!</i>
{\ O (spread): You may be right.}

2228
01:57:32,176 --> 01:57:32,687
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>
{\ O (spread): But nothing is meaningless}

2229
01:57:32,687 --> 01:57:33,198
<i>And you must wield this
ripple energy, or you will die! </i>

2230
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:33,709
<i>That’s right, your fate,
and the fate of the world</i>

2231
01:57:33,709 --> 01:57:34,220
{\an8}<i>(Pa-pa-pa-pow!)</i>

2232
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:34,731
<i>It has been set in motion!</i>

2233
01:57:34,731 --> 01:57:35,242
{\an8}<i>(In, out, in)</i>

2234
01:57:35,242 --> 01:57:35,753
<i>I finally found it!</i>
{\ O (spread): Are you seeing stars?}

2235
01:57:35,753 --> 01:57:36,264
<i>Will I get my hands on it? Our fates</i>

2236
01:57:36,264 --> 01:57:36,775
<i>Are all tied together. This is—</i>

2237
01:57:36,775 --> 01:57:37,286
<i>(In, out!)</i>

2238
01:57:37,286 --> 01:57:37,797
<i>(In, out!)</i>

2239
01:57:37,797 --> 01:57:38,308
<i>(In, out!)</i>

2240
01:57:38,308 --> 01:57:38,819
<i>(In, out!)</i>

2241
01:57:38,819 --> 01:57:39,330
<i>Destiny!</i>

2242
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:39,841
To fight... That is my destiny!

2243
01:57:39,841 --> 01:57:40,352
Mine and Dio’s!

2244
01:57:40,352 --> 01:57:40,863
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,

2245
01:57:40,863 --> 01:57:41,374
That turns humans into vampires.

2246
01:57:41,374 --> 01:57:41,885
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

2247
01:57:41,885 --> 01:57:42,396
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

2248
01:57:42,396 --> 01:57:42,907
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

2249
01:57:42,907 --> 01:57:43,418
Ah, let’s put it this way.

2250
01:57:43,418 --> 01:57:43,929
What must you do to stop that ripple?
{\ O (spread): To avenge a grudge}

2251
01:57:43,929 --> 01:57:44,440
I think I’ve got it!

2252
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:44,951
Use a ripple!

2253
01:57:44,951 --> 01:57:45,462
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!
{\ O (spread): Kill them all.}

2254
01:57:45,462 --> 01:57:45,973
And that wave of energy

2255
01:57:45,973 --> 01:57:46,484
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!
{\ O (spread): Tarkus}

2256
01:57:46,484 --> 01:57:47,000
You see?

2257
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
The power to defeat Dio!

2258
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
<i>(In, out!)</i>

2259
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,850
<i>Destiny!</i>

2260
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:42,700
To fight... That is my destiny!
{\ O (spread): Pride, the great wrestler Bruford}

2261
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:46,550
Mine and Dio’s!

2262
01:58:46,550 --> 01:58:50,400
The Stone Mask’s bone needles
draw a strange power from the brain,
{\ O (spread): Your thoughts and pride}

2263
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:54,250
That turns humans into vampires.

2264
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:58,100
Beings who must get energy
by taking the blood of others.

2265
01:58:58,100 --> 01:59:01,950
However, the ripple also derives its
power from the flow of the bloodstream.

2266
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:05,800
It’s the same energy, like
two sides of the same coin.

2267
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:09,650
Ah, let’s put it this way.

2268
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:13,500
What must you do to stop that ripple?

2269
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:17,350
I think I’ve got it!

2270
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:21,200
Use a ripple!

2271
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:25,050
If you hit them with another
ripple, they’ll break apart!

2272
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:28,900
And that wave of energy

2273
01:59:28,900 --> 01:59:32,750
Has the same shape as the light of the sun!

2274
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:36,600
You see?

2275
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,450
The power to defeat Dio!

2276
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:44,300
We’re already out of time.

2277
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:48,150
You must learn how to turn
your courage into power!

2278
01:59:48,150 --> 01:59:52,000
JoJo?

2279
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
What do you mean, Dio?

2280
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:54,931
Erina...
{\ O (spread): I won't let you get in my way}

2281
01:59:54,931 --> 01:59:55,862
I can’t get you involved in this!

2282
01:59:55,862 --> 01:59:56,793
For now, please just go along with it!

2283
01:59:56,793 --> 01:59:57,724
I swear I’ll come back here again.

2284
01:59:57,724 --> 01:59:58,655
How...?

2285
01:59:58,655 --> 01:59:59,586
Is this the power of JoJo’s ripple?

2286
01:59:59,586 --> 02:00:00,517
<i>The clouds are drifting by
and the wind is swirling round</i>

2287
02:00:00,517 --> 02:00:01,448
<i>Leaving memories behind</i>

2288
02:00:01,448 --> 02:00:02,379
<i>I nodded along, to your resolve</i>

2289
02:00:02,379 --> 02:00:03,310
<i>To the sorrow you held</i>

2290
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:04,241
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>

2291
02:00:04,241 --> 02:00:05,172
<i>Guided by this hapless fate</i>
{\ O (spread): Fuck}

2292
02:00:05,172 --> 02:00:06,103
<i>As I wander here, mired in mud</i>
{\ O (spread): Fuck}

2293
02:00:06,103 --> 02:00:07,034
<i>I am left behind</i>

2294
02:00:07,034 --> 02:00:07,965
<i>I live in a dream,
waiting by the window</i>

2295
02:00:07,965 --> 02:00:08,896
<i>Tell me, why am I left in solitude? </i>

2296
02:00:08,896 --> 02:00:09,827
<i>Even if it doesn’t reach you,
even if it won’t bring you back to me,</i>

2297
02:00:09,827 --> 02:00:10,758
<i>I want to scream!</i>

2298
02:00:10,758 --> 02:00:11,689
<i>Because you left for my sake</i>

2299
02:00:11,689 --> 02:00:12,620
<i>You are drawn to me</i>

<i>Forever guided by fate</i>

<i>Waiting right here</i>

<i>So that one day you’ll tell me the story,</i>

2305
02:00:17,275 --> 02:00:18,206
<i>I’ll keep living with pride</i>

2306
02:00:18,206 --> 02:00:19,137
<i>I’ll accept every part of you</i>

2307
02:00:19,137 --> 02:00:20,068
<i>So that I can call this

2308

<i>Yes, so that I can call it that</i>

2309

C’mere!

2329
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:14,195
Why are you so strong?!

2330
02:03:14,195 --> 02:03:18,030
Don’t tell me... It’s
because of that damn Dio!

2331
02:03:18,030 --> 02:03:21,865
Speeeedwagon!

2332
02:03:21,865 --> 02:03:25,700
You know too much about
the secret of the Stone Mask!

2333
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:29,535
JOJO: Stop right there!

2334
02:03:29,535 --> 02:03:33,370
Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread): now}

2335
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:37,205
I wa-ha-ha-was looking for you too!

2336
02:03:37,205 --> 02:03:41,040
Because, because Lord Dio
said I could slurp up your blood!

2337
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:44,875

He’s strong enough to rival you.
{\ O (spread): Branboard}

2342
02:04:00,215 --> 02:04:04,050
What was that, you old fart?

2343
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:07,885
<i>Old fart?</i>
{\ O (spread): pain}

2344
02:04:07,885 --> 02:04:11,720
Time for a taste!

02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,555
His arm... got longer!
{\ O (spread): You just said pain}

2346
02:04:15,555 --> 02:04:19,390
It’s useless.
{\ O (spread): You are feeling pain now}

2347
02:04:19,390 --> 02:04:23,225
I’ve been given new life!
{\ O (spread): pain}

2348
02:04:23,225 --> 02:04:27,060
And a body that transcends humanit—
{\ O (spread): So I stopped fighting with you}

2349
02:04:27,060 --> 02:04:30,895
That’s not what’s important here.
{\ O (spread): So you stopped the sword}

M-My body...
{\ O (spread): You are a proud knight}

2351
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:38,565
It’s hot!

2352
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:42,400
What the—it’s hot! So hot!!

2353
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:46,235
Ah! Wait!
{\ O (spread): Proof of Life}

2354
02:04:46,235 --> 02:04:50,070
It’s amazing!
{\ O (spread): Is this a human?}

2355
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:53,905
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.

2356
02:04:53,905 --> 02:04:57,740
What’s wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread): I can feel the joy of being here now}

2357
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,575
I lost so much...
{\ O (spread): A strange sense of peace}

2358
02:05:01,575 --> 02:05:05,410
That’s why I wanted power.

2359
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:09,245
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

2360
02:05:09,245 --> 02:05:13,100
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!
{\ O (spread): Let me make you follow the words engraved on my sword}

2361
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,500
But it’s the same power!

2362
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,600
It’s amazing!

2363
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:31,393
In this short time, you’ve
learned the ripple so well.

2364
02:05:31,393 --> 02:05:32,186
What’s wrong, JoJo?
{\ O (spread): That I have to kill}

2365
02:05:32,186 --> 02:05:32,979
I lost so much...

2366
02:05:32,979 --> 02:05:33,772
That’s why I wanted power.

2367
02:05:33,772 --> 02:05:34,565
But not this...
Not the same as Dio’s!

2368
02:05:34,565 --> 02:05:35,358
Yours is fundamentally different
from those who gain power by stealing!

2369
02:05:35,358 --> 02:05:36,151
But it’s the same power!

2370
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:36,944
There’s a saying in the
northern country of Norway:
{\ O (spread): You are this Dio}

2371
02:05:36,944 --> 02:05:37,737
“The north wind created the brave vikings!”
{\ O (spread): Hey Baby}

2372
02:05:37,737 --> 02:05:38,530
Because they knew the pain
of the harsh northern winds,
{\ O (spread): The plant's jamon attack will tempt you.}

2373
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:39,323
They became vikings with backbone!

2374
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:40,116
You are different from Dio and his ilk!
{\ O (spread): More vulgar than a frog's argument}

2375
02:05:40,116 --> 02:05:40,909
Because you feel the pain.

2376
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:41,702
Pain...

2377
02:05:41,702 --> 02:05:42,495
<i>The pain of losing friends</i>

2378
02:05:42,495 --> 02:05:43,288
<i>The pain of inheriting your family’s pride</i>

2379
02:05:43,288 --> 02:05:44,081
<i>Even for those you want to protect—</i>

2380
02:05:44,081 --> 02:05:44,874
<i>Pain is proof they’re alive</i>

2381
02:05:44,874 --> 02:05:45,667
You need to listen to that pain!

2382
02:05:45,667 --> 02:05:46,460
<i>I was always told to be a gentleman</i>

2383
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:47,253
<i>Forever walking in my father’s footsteps</i>
{\ O (spread): Victory!}

2384
02:05:47,253 --> 02:05:48,046
<i>I still don’t understand what
it means to be a true gentleman</i>

2385
02:05:48,046 --> 02:05:48,839
<i>But the Joestar blood
resonating in my heart burns hot</i>

2386
02:05:48,839 --> 02:05:49,632
<i>The Stone Mask bursts with light</i>

2387
02:05:49,632 --> 02:05:50,425
<i>Staining the darkness red</i>

2388
02:05:50,425 --> 02:05:51,218
<i>So that this tragedy will never repeat</i>

2389
02:05:51,218 --> 02:05:52,011
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

2390
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:52,804
It was pure coincidence!

2391
02:05:52,804 --> 02:05:53,600
I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

2392
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
What was that?!

2393
02:05:55,600 --> 02:06:00,188
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memories</i>

2394
02:06:00,188 --> 02:06:04,776
<i>My father and I once
crossed the seven seas</i>
{\ O (spread): Collapse}

2395
02:06:04,776 --> 02:06:09,364
<i>One quiet and calm night</i>
{\ O (spread): I'll destroy that evil spirit.}

2396
02:06:09,364 --> 02:06:13,952
<i>The mask burst with light</i>
{\ O (spread): Sink into the darkness of history}

2397
02:06:13,952 --> 02:06:18,540
<i>And all 58 men of my
crew were massacred</i>

2398
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:23,128
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread): Old man}

2399
02:06:23,128 --> 02:06:27,716
<i>The man in the mask came forward</i>
{\ O (spread): Mr. Jepel}

2400
02:06:27,716 --> 02:06:32,304
<i>ZEP: Clothed in blood and darkness
JOJO: The same as it was then!</i>

2401
02:06:32,304 --> 02:06:36,892
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated
by the salvation of the morning sun, was—</i>

2402
02:06:36,892 --> 02:06:41,480
It was my father!

2403
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:46,068
<i>Under the red light of the
morning sun, my father disappeared</i>

2404
02:06:46,068 --> 02:06:50,656
<i>My soul’s clock has been
frozen in that moment ever since</i>

2405
02:06:50,656 --> 02:06:55,244
<i>We embrace this pain</i>
{\ O (spread): Old man}

<i>ZEP: So that tomorrow will be

2409
02:07:09,008 --> 02:07:13,596
<i>We embrace this pain!</i>

2410
02:07:13,596 --> 02:07:18,184
What you need is the courage
to make that pain your own!

2411
02:07:18,184 --> 02:07:22,780
And the resolve to face the consequences.

2412
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,420
JoJo!

2413
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,220
<i>We embrace this pain</i>

2414

I was the one who excavated
that cursed Stone Mask!

2416
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:36,490
What was that?!

2417
02:08:36,490 --> 02:08:39,580
<i>It’s a wedge driven into the

Mr. Zeppeli!

02:09:01,210 --> 02:09:04,300
<i>What I saw in that moment, illuminated

2426
02:09:04,300 --> 02:09:07,390
It was my father!
{\ O (spread): It was like having a best friend and a son at the same time.}

2427
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:10,480
<i>Under the red light of the

{\ O (spread): thank you}

{\ O (spread): The golden light inside me}

2434
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,325
What you need is the courage

{\ O (spread): There is one certain thing that I want to release in my heart right now}

2435
02:09:24,325 --> 02:09:25,810
And the resolve to face the consequences.
{\ O (spread): Embrace it and escape from this prison}

2436
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:27,295
JoJo!

2437
02:09:27,295 --> 02:09:28,780
Hey JoJo.
{\ O (spread): I'll light up the darkness and come to you}

2438
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:30,265
JoJo JoJo JoJo.
{\ O (spread): My hands to you}

2439
02:09:30,265 --> 02:09:31,750
Ha-hey JoJo.
{\ O (spread): girl}

2440

Hey-ha-hey-ha JoJo.
{\ O (spread): Okay, okay.}

2441
02:09:33,235 --> 02:09:34,720
Don’t forget this goal.
{\ O (spread): Can't you hear my voice, my voice calling out to you?}

2442
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,205
Yes, sir.
{\ O (spread): I can't hear it, I've already killed the past}

2443
02:09:36,205 --> 02:09:37,690
I believe in the power of the ripple.
{\ O (spread): Don't call me by my name, I'm not like you}

2444
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:39,175
Yep.

2445
02:09:39,175 --> 02:09:40,660
I like your fringe.

2446
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:42,145
JoJo!

2447
02:09:42,145 --> 02:09:43,630
Hey JoJo, JoJo!

2448

Jonathan Joestar!

2450
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:48,085
Lord Dio! It hurts! Where are you?

2451
02:09:48,085 --> 02:09:49,570
Are you angry?

2452
02:09:49,570 --> 02:09:51,055
You’re good company, huh?

2453
02:09:51,055 --> 02:09:52,540
Oh! It burns! It burns!

2454
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:54,025

{\ O (spread): It's a wonderful world where I control everything. Even death and history...}

Your, your ancestors—
{\ O (spread): And to do so, do we rob innocent people?}

2457
02:09:56,995 --> 02:09:58,480
Clippity clop, clippity clop!
{\ O (spread): It's a noble sacrifice for the future I envision.}

2458
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,965

<i>We drove, no stopping sites</i>

<i>When we pass through this

Wang Chan definitely fled here.

Without a doubt, this is where
Dio is building his own empire.

It’ll be better if we search for
them while the sun is still out.

2485

The entrance to the town
is through this tunnel.

It’ll be better if we search for

You’ve heard of fleas, yes?

Could you call something

What are you yammering on about!

2588
02:12:25,774 --> 02:12:27,208
So then, what exactly is “courage”?

2589
02:12:27,208 --> 02:12:28,642
“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

2590
02:12:28,642 --> 02:12:30,076
Surrendering to that fear
throws your breath out of sync.

2591
02:12:30,076 --> 02:12:31,510
The ripple breathing technique
is a product of courage!
{\ O (spread): I will always support you}

I’ve heard it has many tricks, because
it was once a training ground for knights.

2606
02:14:56,712 --> 02:14:58,640
There’s also a vast catacomb underground.

2607

They’re inviting us. We must go farther.

2608

02:18:33,612 --> 02:18:34,304
And your tongue is sticking
out of the hole? Really, Jack?
{\ O (spread): Until it disappears}

2680
02:18:34,304 --> 02:18:34,996
Dio!

2681
02:18:34,996 --> 02:18:35,688
Oh, it really is.
{\ O (spread): Everything is connected}

2682
02:18:35,688 --> 02:18:36,380
The sun has set.

2683
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:37,072
It’s time for your lives
to go down with it!

2684
02:18:37,072 --> 02:18:37,764
I’ve been building up my
courage for this moment!

2685
02:18:37,764 --> 02:18:38,456
Even so, I can’t help
this feeling of dread.

2686
02:18:38,456 --> 02:18:39,148
As a human, I can’t let
you get away with this!

2687
02:18:39,148 --> 02:18:39,840
JoJo!

2688
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:40,532
Put your training to use.
{\ O (spread): I'll live}

2689
02:18:40,532 --> 02:18:41,224
<i>(We’ll feast! On your blood and flesh!)</i>

2690
02:18:41,224 --> 02:18:41,916
<i>(Steal it away!)</i>

2691
02:18:41,916 --> 02:18:42,608
<i>(To heal all of our wounds!)</i>

2692
02:18:42,608 --> 02:18:43,300
<i>JoJo, here’s a lesson for you</i>
{\ O (spread): I'll live}

2693
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:43,992
<i>The north wind made the vikings!</i>

2694
02:18:43,992 --> 02:18:44,684
This battle will be an exercise—
{\ O (spread): It's about you}

2695
02:18:44,684 --> 02:18:45,376
You’ll defeat them without spilling
a single drop of wine from this glass!
{\ O (spread): Before my consciousness melts}

2696
02:18:45,376 --> 02:18:46,068
SPW: We’re not here to play around, have you lost it?
ZEP: You shut your trap!
{\ O (spread): I thought you were coming.}

2697
02:18:46,068 --> 02:18:46,760
The north wind made the vikings!

2698
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:47,452
JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—
{\ O (spread): Let go, JoJo!}

2699
02:18:47,452 --> 02:18:48,144
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>

2700
02:18:48,144 --> 02:18:48,836
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>

{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>
{\ O (spread): It's about you}

2702
02:18:49,528 --> 02:18:50,220
<i>Make fear your own!
Here’s a battle lesson:</i>

2703
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:50,912
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time
comes, don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>

2704

<i>The hymn of humanity is a song of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread): Let go, JoJo!}

<i>The greatness of humanity is
the greatness of courage!</i>
{\ O (spread): His proud life}

2706
02:18:52,296 --> 02:18:52,988
<i>Everything is connected!
There’s a meaning to it all!</i>
{\ O (spread): Vanished beyond the customer}

2707
02:18:52,988 --> 02:18:53,680
<i>Don’t let your breathing go awry!</i>
{\ O (spread): The destiny and adventure}

2708
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:54,372
{\an8}<i>(Wry!)</i>

2709
02:18:54,372 --> 02:18:55,064
<i>This wine will be my north wind!</i>

2710
02:18:55,064 --> 02:18:55,756
{\an8}<i>(Give us your blood!)</i>

2711
02:18:55,756 --> 02:18:56,448
<i>The ripple of the wine!</i>

2712
02:18:56,448 --> 02:18:57,140
{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

2713
02:18:57,140 --> 02:18:57,832
<i>I can feel it flow, I’ll find my

{\an8}<i>(We’ll feast on your flesh!)</i>

2718
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,292
<i>With the power of the sun!</i>

02:19:01,292 --> 02:19:01,984
<i>Find your way through the darkness!</i>

2720
02:19:01,984 --> 02:19:02,676
<i>Oh, my heart resonates!</i>

JACK: I’ll kill them!
DIO: Ah—wait, wait—

2737
02:20:38,713 --> 02:20:41,226
<i>Tough vikings were born
from the harsh north wind</i>

2738
02:20:41,226 --> 02:20:43,739
<i>Will this wine make a viking out of you?</i>

2741
02:20:48,765 --> 02:20:51,278
<i>Muster up your courage! When the time

This is the power
that will defeat you!

2771
02:22:04,155 --> 02:22:06,668
Dio Brando?

2772
02:22:06,668 --> 02:22:09,200
Yeah?

2773
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
I don’t know you, but...

2774
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,700
Let me say this to the Stone
Mask that awakened your brain:

2775
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,200
Finally, we meet.

2776
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:12,700
Don’t get carried away!

2777
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:13,200
Perhaps you can heal this
wound in my stomach, JoJo.

2778
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:13,700
You’re the one who put it there!

2779
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:14,200
Then I’ll be completely healed from
the damage you dealt me in that fire.

2780
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:14,700
I’ll be using your lives...

2781
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:15,200
To purge this wound!

2782
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:15,700
You bastard!

2783
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,200
Just how many lives did you
extinguish to heal that wound?

2784
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:16,700
Do you remember how many slices of
bread you’ve eaten in your lifetime?
{\ O (spread): Thank you very much.}

2785
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:17,200
I’ll make you submit!

2786
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
By the ripple of the sun!

2787
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:20,700
Pow!

2788
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:22,200
Utterly pathetic!

2789
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:23,700
It’s freezing?!

2790
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:25,200
I guessed that this energy of yours
is related to the flow of your blood!

2791
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,700
I am able to control my own body at will.

2792
02:22:26,700 --> 02:22:28,200
If I freeze up all of your veins,

2793
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:29,700
Then you won’t be able to use that power!
{\ O (spread): thank you.}

2794
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,200
I can’t—I can’t catch my breath!

2795
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,700
Mr. Zeppeli!

2796
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:34,200
Useless, useless, useless, useless!

2797
02:22:34,200 --> 02:22:35,700
Breathing techniques? Ripple?

2798
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:37,200
If you’re going to be
blowing all this hot air,
{\ O (spread): Thank you, Dad.}

2799
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,700
You ought to use it to
play me a little fanfare!

2800
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,200
Looks like your companions
are just as weak as you.

2801
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:41,700
JOJO: What did you say?
DIO: Companions...

2802
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:43,200
That’s right. Do you remember?

2803
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,700
The story of the knights
your father told us that day?

2804
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:46,200
What?

2805
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,700
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2806
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:49,200
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2807
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,700
Mary Stuart!

2808
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:52,200
It was about the ones who served her!

2809
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:53,700
The story of those two proud knights...

2810
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:55,200
Father told us...

2811
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:56,700
Yes!

2812
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:58,200
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

2813
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,200
JoJo, Dio!

2814
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,200
What?

2815
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:25,533
The tragic queen who was sentenced
to beheading by Elizabeth the First,

2816
02:23:25,533 --> 02:23:42,866
After a failed assassination
plot in the 1600s...

2817
02:23:42,866 --> 02:24:00,199
Mary Stuart!

2818
02:24:00,199 --> 02:24:17,532
It was about the ones who served her!

2819
02:24:17,532 --> 02:24:34,865
The story of those two proud knights...

2820
02:24:34,865 --> 02:24:52,200
Father told us...

2821
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Yes!

2822
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of those two proud knights...

2823
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,857
Father told us...

2824
02:25:04,857 --> 02:25:07,714
Yes!

2825
02:25:07,714 --> 02:25:10,571
We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

2826
02:25:10,571 --> 02:25:13,428
JoJo, Dio!

2827
02:25:13,428 --> 02:25:16,285
I will regale you with
a tale of two knights,

2828
02:25:16,285 --> 02:25:19,142
Which has been passed down for
generations in our great England.

2829
02:25:19,142 --> 02:25:22,000
Those who lived with a gentleman’s spirit—

2830
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
This is a story of knightly pride!

2831
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,285
<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

2832
02:25:26,285 --> 02:25:27,570
<i>Two queens battled for the throne</i>

2833
02:25:27,570 --> 02:25:28,855
<i>One was Queen Elizabeth the First</i>

2834
02:25:28,855 --> 02:25:30,140
<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>

2835
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:31,425
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>

2836
02:25:31,425 --> 02:25:32,710
<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>

2837
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:33,995
<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved
through rocks like butter</i>

2838
02:25:33,995 --> 02:25:35,280
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>

2839
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,565
<i>Without any family, the
two honed their powers</i>

2840
02:25:36,565 --> 02:25:37,850
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>

2841
02:25:37,850 --> 02:25:39,135
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>

2842
02:25:39,135 --> 02:25:40,420
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>

2843
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:41,705
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,

2844
02:25:41,705 --> 02:25:42,990
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.

2845
02:25:42,990 --> 02:25:44,275
<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

2846
02:25:44,275 --> 02:25:45,560
<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>

2847
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:46,845
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>

2848
02:25:46,845 --> 02:25:48,130
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>

2849
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:49,415
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>

2850
02:25:49,415 --> 02:25:50,700
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>

2851
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:51,985
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>

2852
02:25:51,985 --> 02:25:53,270
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>

2853
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:54,555
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>

2854
02:25:54,555 --> 02:25:55,840
But in the moment they
were to be executed—

2855
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,125
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!

2856
02:25:57,125 --> 02:25:58,410
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.

2857
02:25:58,410 --> 02:25:59,695
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!

2858
02:25:59,695 --> 02:26:00,980
Look at her lying over
there like a piece of rubbish!

2859
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,265
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!

2860
02:26:02,265 --> 02:26:03,550
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>

2861
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:04,835
<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

2862
02:26:04,835 --> 02:26:06,120
<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>

2863
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:07,405
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s
muscles were like iron</i>

2864
02:26:07,405 --> 02:26:08,690
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>

2865
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:09,975
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>

2866
02:26:09,975 --> 02:26:11,260
<i>As though it were alive!</i>

2867
02:26:11,260 --> 02:26:12,545
<i>And that is the story,</i>

2868
02:26:12,545 --> 02:26:13,830
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>

2869
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:15,115
<i>Until the very end!</i>

2870
02:26:15,115 --> 02:26:16,400
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!

2871
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:17,685
Oh, what loyal hearts!

2872
02:26:17,685 --> 02:26:18,970
But those two should
have done a better job!

2873
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:20,255
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.

2874
02:26:20,255 --> 02:26:21,540
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!

2875
02:26:21,540 --> 02:26:22,825
It might be as you say, however—

2876
02:26:22,825 --> 02:26:24,110
There is nothing that is without meaning.

2877
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:25,395
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.

2878
02:26:25,395 --> 02:26:26,680
Everything is connected!

2879
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:27,965
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!

2880
02:26:27,965 --> 02:26:29,250
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>

2881
02:26:29,250 --> 02:26:30,535
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>

2882
02:26:30,535 --> 02:26:31,820
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>

2883
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:33,105
<i>Either one—</i>

2884
02:26:33,105 --> 02:26:34,390
<i>JoJo</i>

2885
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:35,675
<i>Dio</i>

2886
02:26:35,675 --> 02:26:37,000
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>

2887
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I turned those two

2888
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,333
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!

2889
02:26:42,333 --> 02:26:45,666
Even history bends before me!

2890
02:26:45,666 --> 02:26:48,999
It can’t be!

2891
02:26:48,999 --> 02:26:52,332
Such grotesque forms!

2892
02:26:52,332 --> 02:26:55,665
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!

2893
02:26:55,665 --> 02:26:58,998
Don’t you think so?

2894
02:26:58,998 --> 02:27:02,331
Kill them all!

2895
02:27:02,331 --> 02:27:05,664
Continue from where
you left off on that day!

2896
02:27:05,664 --> 02:27:08,997
Tarkus!

2897
02:27:08,997 --> 02:27:12,330
Bruford!

2898
02:27:12,330 --> 02:27:15,663
Play me a fanfare with their screams!

2899
02:27:15,663 --> 02:27:18,996
Our grudge!

2900
02:27:18,996 --> 02:27:22,329
Our pride!

2901
02:27:22,329 --> 02:27:25,662
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2902
02:27:25,662 --> 02:27:29,000
And you, Tarkus!

2903
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
The way you feel—

2904
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Your pride, your resentment.

2905
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I can’t even imagine it!

2906
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
But I also bear my own burdens!

2907
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!

2908
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!

2909
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
That man’s pride...

2910
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!

2911
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
My master—I, Bruford,

2912
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,947
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!

2913
02:27:57,947 --> 02:28:01,894
Alright, go ahead!

2914
02:28:01,894 --> 02:28:05,841
We’ll duel as knights!

2915
02:28:05,841 --> 02:28:09,788
Run away, you two!

2916
02:28:09,788 --> 02:28:13,735
Mr. Joestar!

2917
02:28:13,735 --> 02:28:17,682
Tarkus!

2918
02:28:17,682 --> 02:28:21,629
I won’t let you interfere!

2919
02:28:21,629 --> 02:28:25,576
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>

2920
02:28:25,576 --> 02:28:29,523
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>

2921
02:28:29,523 --> 02:28:33,470
Old man!

2922
02:28:33,470 --> 02:28:37,417
Don’t come any closer!

2923
02:28:37,417 --> 02:28:41,364
Damn it...

2924
02:28:41,364 --> 02:28:45,311
Fucking hell!

2925
02:28:45,311 --> 02:28:49,258
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

2926
02:28:49,258 --> 02:28:53,205
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2927
02:28:53,205 --> 02:28:57,152
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

2928
02:28:57,152 --> 02:29:01,099
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

2929
02:29:01,099 --> 02:29:05,046
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

2930
02:29:05,046 --> 02:29:09,000
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2931
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Honourable knight,

2932
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

2933
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And you, Tarkus!

2934
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
Our grudge!

2935
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:33,310
Our pride!

2936
02:30:33,310 --> 02:30:33,560
Great Dark Knight Bruford!

2937
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:33,810
And you, Tarkus!

2938
02:30:33,810 --> 02:30:34,060
The way you feel—

2939
02:30:34,060 --> 02:30:34,310
Your pride, your resentment.

2940
02:30:34,310 --> 02:30:34,560
I can’t even imagine it!

2941
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:34,810

My master—I, Bruford,

Run away, you two!

2951

Mr. Joestar!

2952
02:30:37,310 --> 02:30:37,560
Tarkus!

2953
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:37,810
I won’t let you interfere!

2954
02:30:37,810 --> 02:30:38,060
<i>A wedge driven into the

2955
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:38,310

2957
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:38,810
Don’t come any closer!

2958
02:30:38,810 --> 02:30:39,060
Damn it...

2959
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,060
Fucking hell!

2960
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
Tarkus!

2961
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:47,330
I won’t let you interfere!

2962

02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:48,410
Don’t come any closer!

2966
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:48,680
Damn it...

2967
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:48,950

<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

2974
02:30:50,570 --> 02:30:50,840
Honourable knight,

2975
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:51,110
Is revenge your answer?

2976
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,380
Is that what you take pride in?

2977
02:30:51,380 --> 02:30:51,650
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

2978
02:30:51,650 --> 02:30:51,920
You can lecture me after you win!

2979
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:52,190
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

2980
02:30:52,190 --> 02:30:52,460
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

2981
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:52,730
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

2982
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:53,000
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

2983
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:53,270
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

2984
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:53,540
Old man!

2985
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:53,810
Melt!

2986
02:30:53,810 --> 02:30:54,080
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

2987
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:54,350
Speedwagon...

2988
02:30:54,350 --> 02:30:54,620
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

2989
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:54,890
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

2990
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:55,160
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

2991
02:30:55,160 --> 02:30:55,430
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

2992
02:30:55,430 --> 02:30:55,700
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

2993
02:30:55,700 --> 02:30:55,970
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

2994
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:56,240
JoJo!

2995
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:56,510
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

2996
02:30:56,510 --> 02:30:56,780
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

2997
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:57,060
Let it somehow be restored!

2998
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

2999
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:03,060

Run away, you two!

3006
02:31:09,912 --> 02:31:11,054
Mr. Joestar!

3007
02:31:11,054 --> 02:31:12,196
Tarkus!

3008
02:31:12,196 --> 02:31:13,338
I won’t let you interfere!

3009
02:31:13,338 --> 02:31:14,480
<i>A wedge driven into the

02:31:16,764 --> 02:31:17,906
Don’t come any closer!

3013
02:31:17,906 --> 02:31:19,048
Damn it...

3014
02:31:19,048 --> 02:31:20,190
Fucking hell!

3015
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:21,332
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>

3016
02:31:21,332 --> 02:31:22,474
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>

3017
02:31:22,474 --> 02:31:23,616
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>

3018
02:31:23,616 --> 02:31:24,758
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>

3019
02:31:24,758 --> 02:31:25,900
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>

3020
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:27,042
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>

3021
02:31:27,042 --> 02:31:28,184
Honourable knight,

3022
02:31:28,184 --> 02:31:29,326
Is revenge your answer?

3023
02:31:29,326 --> 02:31:30,468
Is that what you take pride in?

3024
02:31:30,468 --> 02:31:31,610
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!

3025
02:31:31,610 --> 02:31:32,752
You can lecture me after you win!

3026
02:31:32,752 --> 02:31:33,894
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>

3027
02:31:33,894 --> 02:31:35,036
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>

3028
02:31:35,036 --> 02:31:36,178
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>

3029
02:31:36,178 --> 02:31:37,320
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>

3030
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:38,462
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

3031
02:31:38,462 --> 02:31:39,604
Old man!

3032
02:31:39,604 --> 02:31:40,746
Melt!

3033
02:31:40,746 --> 02:31:41,888
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

3034
02:31:41,888 --> 02:31:43,060
Speedwagon...

3035
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,060
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

3036
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:46,508
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

3037
02:31:46,508 --> 02:31:47,956
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

3038
02:31:47,956 --> 02:31:49,404
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

3039
02:31:49,404 --> 02:31:50,852
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

3040
02:31:50,852 --> 02:31:52,300
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

3041
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:53,748
JoJo!

3042
02:31:53,748 --> 02:31:55,196
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

3043
02:31:55,196 --> 02:31:56,644
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

3044
02:31:56,644 --> 02:31:58,092
Let it somehow be restored!

3045
02:31:58,092 --> 02:31:59,540
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

3046
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:00,988
This pain means nothing to me!

3047
02:32:00,988 --> 02:32:02,436
Why aren’t you moving?

3048
02:32:02,436 --> 02:32:03,884
Just now,

3049
02:32:03,884 --> 02:32:05,332
You said “pain”.

3050
02:32:05,332 --> 02:32:06,780
That means that now,

3051
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,228
You can feel pain!

3052
02:32:08,228 --> 02:32:09,676
Pain?

3053
02:32:09,676 --> 02:32:11,124
That’s why...

3054
02:32:11,124 --> 02:32:12,572
I stopped fighting you.

3055
02:32:12,572 --> 02:32:14,020
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3056
02:32:14,020 --> 02:32:15,468
You are a great knight.

3057
02:32:15,468 --> 02:32:16,916
You are human!

3058
02:32:16,916 --> 02:32:18,364
Pain...

3059
02:32:18,364 --> 02:32:19,812
Is proof of life!

3060
02:32:19,812 --> 02:32:21,260
So this is what it means to be human?

3061
02:32:21,260 --> 02:32:22,708
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3062
02:32:22,708 --> 02:32:24,156
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3063
02:32:24,156 --> 02:32:25,604
Bruford...

3064
02:32:25,604 --> 02:32:27,060
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

3065
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Luck!

3066
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:29,060
And also...

3067
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
Pluck!

3068
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>

3069
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:49,371
Old man!

3070
02:32:49,371 --> 02:32:49,682
Melt!

3071
02:32:49,682 --> 02:32:49,993
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!

3072
02:32:49,993 --> 02:32:50,304
Speedwagon...

3073
02:32:50,304 --> 02:32:50,615
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>

3074
02:32:50,615 --> 02:32:50,926
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>

3075
02:32:50,926 --> 02:32:51,237
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>

3076
02:32:51,237 --> 02:32:51,548
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>

3077
02:32:51,548 --> 02:32:51,859
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>

3078
02:32:51,859 --> 02:32:52,170
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

3079
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:52,481
JoJo!

3080
02:32:52,481 --> 02:32:52,792
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

3081
02:32:52,792 --> 02:32:53,103
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

3082
02:32:53,103 --> 02:32:53,414
Let it somehow be restored!

3083
02:32:53,414 --> 02:32:53,725
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

3084
02:32:53,725 --> 02:32:54,036
This pain means nothing to me!

3085
02:32:54,036 --> 02:32:54,347
Why aren’t you moving?

3086
02:32:54,347 --> 02:32:54,658
Just now,

3087
02:32:54,658 --> 02:32:54,969
You said “pain”.

3088
02:32:54,969 --> 02:32:55,280
That means that now,

3089
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:55,591
You can feel pain!

3090
02:32:55,591 --> 02:32:55,902
Pain?

3091
02:32:55,902 --> 02:32:56,213
That’s why...

3092
02:32:56,213 --> 02:32:56,524
I stopped fighting you.

3093
02:32:56,524 --> 02:32:56,835
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3094
02:32:56,835 --> 02:32:57,146
You are a great knight.

3095
02:32:57,146 --> 02:32:57,457
You are human!

3096
02:32:57,457 --> 02:32:57,768
Pain...

3097
02:32:57,768 --> 02:32:58,079
Is proof of life!

3098
02:32:58,079 --> 02:32:58,390
So this is what it means to be human?

3099
02:32:58,390 --> 02:32:58,701
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3100
02:32:58,701 --> 02:32:59,012
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3101
02:32:59,012 --> 02:32:59,323
Bruford...

3102
02:32:59,323 --> 02:32:59,634
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

3103
02:32:59,634 --> 02:32:59,945
Luck!

3104
02:32:59,945 --> 02:33:00,256
And also...

3105
02:33:00,256 --> 02:33:00,567
Pluck!

3106
02:33:00,567 --> 02:33:00,878
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

3107
02:33:00,878 --> 02:33:01,189
Damn you!

3108
02:33:01,189 --> 02:33:01,500
JoJo!

3109
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:01,811
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

3110
02:33:01,811 --> 02:33:02,122
Just as I thought...

3111
02:33:02,122 --> 02:33:02,433
I, Dio, will—

3112
02:33:02,433 --> 02:33:02,744
Hey baby!

3113
02:33:02,744 --> 02:33:03,060
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

3114
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
What the...

3115
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,060
Why aren’t you moving?

3116
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,060
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>

3117
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:29,060
JoJo!

3118
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,060
Cut finely, beat of my blood!

3119
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:33,060
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

3120
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:35,060
Let it somehow be restored!

3121
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:37,060
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

3122
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,060
This pain means nothing to me!

3123
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:39,893
Why aren’t you moving?

3124
02:33:39,893 --> 02:33:40,726
Just now,

3125
02:33:40,726 --> 02:33:41,559
You said “pain”.

3126
02:33:41,559 --> 02:33:42,392
That means that now,

3127
02:33:42,392 --> 02:33:43,225
You can feel pain!

3128
02:33:43,225 --> 02:33:44,058
Pain?

3129
02:33:44,058 --> 02:33:44,891
That’s why...

3130
02:33:44,891 --> 02:33:45,724
I stopped fighting you.

3131
02:33:45,724 --> 02:33:46,557
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3132
02:33:46,557 --> 02:33:47,390
You are a great knight.

3133
02:33:47,390 --> 02:33:48,223
You are human!

3134
02:33:48,223 --> 02:33:49,056
Pain...

3135
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:49,889
Is proof of life!

3136
02:33:49,889 --> 02:33:50,722
So this is what it means to be human?

3137
02:33:50,722 --> 02:33:51,555
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3138
02:33:51,555 --> 02:33:52,388
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3139
02:33:52,388 --> 02:33:53,221
Bruford...

3140
02:33:53,221 --> 02:33:54,054
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

3141
02:33:54,054 --> 02:33:54,887
Luck!

3142
02:33:54,887 --> 02:33:55,720
And also...

3143
02:33:55,720 --> 02:33:56,553
Pluck!

3144
02:33:56,553 --> 02:33:57,386
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

3145
02:33:57,386 --> 02:33:58,219
Damn you!

3146
02:33:58,219 --> 02:33:59,052
JoJo!

3147
02:33:59,052 --> 02:33:59,885
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

3148
02:33:59,885 --> 02:34:00,718
Just as I thought...

3149
02:34:00,718 --> 02:34:01,551
I, Dio, will—

3150
02:34:01,551 --> 02:34:02,384
Hey baby!

3151
02:34:02,384 --> 02:34:03,217
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

3152
02:34:03,217 --> 02:34:04,050
What the...

3153
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:04,883
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3154
02:34:04,883 --> 02:34:05,716
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3155
02:34:05,716 --> 02:34:06,549
What an embarrassment of a knight!

3156
02:34:06,549 --> 02:34:07,382
He never got his revenge!

3157
02:34:07,382 --> 02:34:08,215
What did he have to be joyful about!

3158
02:34:08,215 --> 02:34:09,060
JoJo!

3159
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
No!

3160
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060
Please... This knight’s proud heart,

3161
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:29,375
Let it somehow be restored!

3162
02:34:29,375 --> 02:34:29,690
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!

3163
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:30,005
This pain means nothing to me!

3164
02:34:30,005 --> 02:34:30,320
Why aren’t you moving?

3165
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:30,635
Just now,

3166
02:34:30,635 --> 02:34:30,950
You said “pain”.

3167
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:31,265
That means that now,

3168
02:34:31,265 --> 02:34:31,580
You can feel pain!

3169
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:31,895
Pain?

3170
02:34:31,895 --> 02:34:32,210
That’s why...

3171
02:34:32,210 --> 02:34:32,525
I stopped fighting you.

3172
02:34:32,525 --> 02:34:32,840
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3173
02:34:32,840 --> 02:34:33,155
You are a great knight.

3174
02:34:33,155 --> 02:34:33,470
You are human!

3175
02:34:33,470 --> 02:34:33,785
Pain...

3176
02:34:33,785 --> 02:34:34,100
Is proof of life!

3177
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:34,415
So this is what it means to be human?

3178
02:34:34,415 --> 02:34:34,730
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3179
02:34:34,730 --> 02:34:35,060
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3180
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,060
Bruford...

3181
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Pain?

3182
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You said “pain”.

3183
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:53,060
That means that now,

3184
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:55,060
You can feel pain!

3185
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:55,393
Pain?

3186
02:34:55,393 --> 02:34:55,726
That’s why...

3187
02:34:55,726 --> 02:34:56,059
I stopped fighting you.

3188
02:34:56,059 --> 02:34:56,392
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3189
02:34:56,392 --> 02:34:56,725
You are a great knight.

3190
02:34:56,725 --> 02:34:57,060
You are human!

3191
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Pain...

3192
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I stopped fighting you.

3193
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That’s why you stopped your sword.

3194
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a great knight.

3195
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,500
You are human!

3196
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:22,000
Pain...

3197
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is proof of life!

3198
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
You are human!

3199
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:31,666
Pain...

3200
02:35:31,666 --> 02:35:32,332
Is proof of life!

3201
02:35:32,332 --> 02:35:33,000
So this is what it means to be human?

3202
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.

3203
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.

3204
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Bruford...

3205
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.

3206
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:00,437
Luck!

3207
02:36:00,437 --> 02:36:01,874
And also...

3208
02:36:01,874 --> 02:36:03,311
Pluck!

3209
02:36:03,311 --> 02:36:04,748
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...

3210
02:36:04,748 --> 02:36:06,185
Damn you!

3211
02:36:06,185 --> 02:36:07,622
JoJo!

3212
02:36:07,622 --> 02:36:09,059
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!

3213
02:36:09,059 --> 02:36:10,496
Just as I thought...

3214
02:36:10,496 --> 02:36:11,933
I, Dio, will—

3215
02:36:11,933 --> 02:36:13,370
Hey baby!

3216
02:36:13,370 --> 02:36:14,807
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

3217
02:36:14,807 --> 02:36:16,244
What the...

3218
02:36:16,244 --> 02:36:17,681
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3219
02:36:17,681 --> 02:36:19,118
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3220
02:36:19,118 --> 02:36:20,555
What an embarrassment of a knight!

3221
02:36:20,555 --> 02:36:22,000
He never got his revenge!

3222
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
What did he have to be joyful about!

3223
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:25,925
JoJo!

3224
02:36:25,925 --> 02:36:26,850
No!

3225
02:36:26,850 --> 02:36:27,775
How could you!

3226
02:36:27,775 --> 02:36:28,700
For victory!

3227
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:29,625
I take pride in victory!

3228
02:36:29,625 --> 02:36:30,550
Fuck!

3229
02:36:30,550 --> 02:36:31,475
I’ll get you!

3230
02:36:31,475 --> 02:36:32,400
I’ll get you for this!

3231
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:33,325
JoJo...

3232
02:36:33,325 --> 02:36:34,250
JoJo!

3233
02:36:34,250 --> 02:36:35,175
My final ripple...

3234
02:36:35,175 --> 02:36:36,100
My... dying wish is...

3235
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:37,025
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3236
02:36:37,025 --> 02:36:37,950
He collapsed.

3237
02:36:37,950 --> 02:36:38,875
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

3238
02:36:38,875 --> 02:36:39,800
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

3239
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:40,725
Old man!

3240
02:36:40,725 --> 02:36:41,650
Mr. Zeppeli!

3241
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:42,575
If we lose you—

3242
02:36:42,575 --> 02:36:43,500
There’s no time to be sad.

3243
02:36:43,500 --> 02:36:44,425
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

3244
02:36:44,425 --> 02:36:45,350
Old man!

3245
02:36:45,350 --> 02:36:46,275
I...

3246
02:36:46,275 --> 02:36:47,200
I lived my own life to the fullest.

3247
02:36:47,200 --> 02:36:48,125
In the end,

3248
02:36:48,125 --> 02:36:49,050
I leave everything I have to you.

3249
02:36:49,050 --> 02:36:50,000
JoJo,

3250
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You are my hope.

3251
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Hey baby!

3252
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!

3253
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:06,000
What the...

3254
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!

3255
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,571
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!

3256
02:37:15,571 --> 02:37:22,142
What an embarrassment of a knight!

3257
02:37:22,142 --> 02:37:28,713
He never got his revenge!

3258
02:37:28,713 --> 02:37:35,284
What did he have to be joyful about!

3259
02:37:35,284 --> 02:37:41,855
JoJo!

3260
02:37:41,855 --> 02:37:48,426
No!

3261
02:37:48,426 --> 02:37:55,000
How could you!

3262
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
For victory!

3263
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,777
I take pride in victory!

3264
02:38:02,777 --> 02:38:07,554
Fuck!

3265
02:38:07,554 --> 02:38:12,331
I’ll get you!

3266
02:38:12,331 --> 02:38:17,108
I’ll get you for this!

3267
02:38:17,108 --> 02:38:21,885
JoJo...

3268
02:38:21,885 --> 02:38:26,662
JoJo!

3269
02:38:26,662 --> 02:38:31,439
My final ripple...

3270
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:36,216
My... dying wish is...

3271
02:38:36,216 --> 02:38:41,000
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!

3272
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
He collapsed.

3273
02:38:44,000 --> 02:39:00,000
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!

3274
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!

3275
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Old man!

3276
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Mr. Zeppeli!

3277
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:12,666
If we lose you—

3278
02:39:12,666 --> 02:39:16,332
There’s no time to be sad.

3279
02:39:16,332 --> 02:39:20,000
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!

3280
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Old man!

3281
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,333
I...

3282
02:39:28,333 --> 02:39:34,666
I lived my own life to the fullest.

3283
02:39:34,666 --> 02:39:40,999
In the end,

3284
02:39:40,999 --> 02:39:47,332
I leave everything I have to you.

3285
02:39:47,332 --> 02:39:53,665
JoJo,

3286
02:39:53,665 --> 02:40:00,000
You are my hope.

3287
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>

3288
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:14,500
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>

3289
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:21,000
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>

3290
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:32,000
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>

3291
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>

3292
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:40,000
<i>Into my spirit</i>

3293
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,000
It felt like...

3294
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.

3295
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:52,352
From here on...

3296
02:40:52,352 --> 02:40:52,704
I live within you.

3297
02:40:52,704 --> 02:40:53,056
JoJo.

3298
02:40:53,056 --> 02:40:53,408
<i>Everything is connected</i>

3299
02:40:53,408 --> 02:40:53,760
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

3300
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:54,112
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

3301
02:40:54,112 --> 02:40:54,464
<i>Even this pain...</i>

3302
02:40:54,464 --> 02:40:54,816
<i>Even this pain</i>

3303
02:40:54,816 --> 02:40:55,168
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3304
02:40:55,168 --> 02:40:55,520
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

3305
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:55,872
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

3306
02:40:55,872 --> 02:40:56,224
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

3307
02:40:56,224 --> 02:40:56,576
<i>And from this prison...</i>

3308
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:56,928
<i>I see the stars</i>

3309
02:40:56,928 --> 02:40:57,280
<i>A golden spirit</i>

3310
02:40:57,280 --> 02:40:57,632
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

3311
02:40:57,632 --> 02:40:58,000
<i>Will light up</i>

3312
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
<i>The way to you...</i>

3313
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:14,000
<i>Everything is connected</i>

3314
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,000
<i>There’s a meaning to it all</i>

3315
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:20,000
<i>That’s what I’ve come to believe</i>

3316
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
<i>Even this pain...</i>

3317
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:29,000
<i>Even this pain</i>

3318
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:42,000
<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>

3319
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:51,000
<i>The golden light that
shines from within me</i>

3320
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:59,500
<i>It’s the one thing in my heart
that I can hold on to now</i>

3321
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:08,000
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

3322
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:16,000
<i>And from this prison...</i>

3323
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
<i>I see the stars</i>

3324
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
<i>A golden spirit</i>

3325
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

3326
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,000
<i>Will light up</i>

3327
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,000
<i>The way to you...</i>

3328
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Dio!

3329
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:43,000
<i>Light up the way to you...</i>

3330
02:42:43,000 --> 02:43:00,000
JoJo...!

3331
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:17,000
<i>Dio...</i>

3332
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:34,000
<i>Dio...</i>

3333
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:41,000
<i>Can’t you hear my voice?</i>

3334
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:41,333
<i>The voice calling for you?</i>

3335
02:43:41,333 --> 02:43:41,666
<i>I can’t hear you</i>

3336
02:43:41,666 --> 02:43:42,000
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

3337
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:50,000
<i>I already killed my past</i>

3338
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
{\an8}<i>Dio...</i>

3339
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:59,000
<i>Don’t call my name—</i>

3340
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:02,607
<i>You and I are different</i>

3341
02:44:02,607 --> 02:44:06,214
<i>We’re not so different, you’re my son</i>

3342
02:44:06,214 --> 02:44:09,821
<i>I have changed into something new</i>

3343
02:44:09,821 --> 02:44:13,428
<i>You’re not so changed,
you did it to survive</i>

3344
02:44:13,428 --> 02:44:17,035
<i>I’ll use any means</i>

3345
02:44:17,035 --> 02:44:20,642
<i>DIO: I’ll steal it all
DARIO: You’ll steal it all</i>

3346
02:44:20,642 --> 02:44:24,249
<i>DIO: Upend righteousness</i>

3347
02:44:24,249 --> 02:44:27,856
<i>DARIO: You’re my clever boy!</i>

3348
02:44:27,856 --> 02:44:31,463
<i>DIO: I will conquer it all</i>

3349
02:44:31,463 --> 02:44:35,070
<i>DARIO: What will you want next?</i>

3350
02:44:35,070 --> 02:44:38,677
<i>DIO: I will dominate everything</i>

3351
02:44:38,677 --> 02:44:42,284
<i>Go ahead and dominate,
what will you want after that?</i>

3352
02:44:42,284 --> 02:44:45,891
<i>What do I want?</i>

3353
02:44:45,891 --> 02:44:49,498
<i>DARIO: What do you want?</i>

3354
02:44:49,498 --> 02:44:53,105
<i>DIO: What do I want?</i>

3355
02:44:53,105 --> 02:44:56,712
<i>I want...</i>

3356
02:44:56,712 --> 02:45:00,319
<i>I want...</i>

3357
02:45:00,319 --> 02:45:03,926
{\an8}<i>Dio... Dio...</i>

3358
02:45:03,926 --> 02:45:07,533
<i>I want...</i>

3359
02:45:07,533 --> 02:45:11,140
So you’ve come...

3360
02:45:11,140 --> 02:45:14,747
JoJo.

3361
02:45:14,747 --> 02:45:18,354
Is this...

3362
02:45:18,354 --> 02:45:21,961
The world you wished for?

3363
02:45:21,961 --> 02:45:25,568
What?

3364
02:45:25,568 --> 02:45:29,175
The world...

3365
02:45:29,175 --> 02:45:32,782
That you’ve been trying
to obtain for so long...

3366
02:45:32,782 --> 02:45:36,389
Surrounded by death...

3367
02:45:36,389 --> 02:45:40,000
It’s a pitiful world, isn’t it?

3368
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
It’s a splendid world where
I’ve dominated everything.

3369
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I’ve dominated death, and even history too.

3370
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
For that reason, you stole
from uninvolved innocents?

3371
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:03,000
They were a noble sacrifice for
the sake of the future that I designed.

3372
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:07,400
You’re just afraid.

3373
02:46:07,400 --> 02:46:11,800
Of being human...

3374
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:16,200
That’s why you rejected your humanity.

3375
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,600
For the sake of obtaining this world...

3376
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:25,000
I’ve <i>transcended</i> humanity!

3377
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
You ran away from it.

3378
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:31,700
The ends justify the means.

3379
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:36,400
I will win,

3380
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:41,100
And that means conquering
everything, of course.

3381
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:45,800
All of this is fate!

3382
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:50,500
No!

3383
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:55,200
This is just how you
chose to live your life!

3384
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,900
Opposing fate...

3385
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:04,600
What will your legacy be?

3386
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:09,300
Such righteousness!

3387
02:47:09,300 --> 02:47:14,000
Just like the one who gave me this power...

3388
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And then died!

3389
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Just like...

3390
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Your father.

3391
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
That’s right.

3392
02:47:47,000 --> 02:48:01,000
As a gentleman, it pains
me to say this, but...

3393
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Now I, Jonathan Joestar...

3394
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
For the sake of revenge...

3395
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Dio...

3396
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I will kill you!

3397
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,666
We’re one and the same; you want
to exact your revenge! I admire that!

3398
02:48:13,666 --> 02:48:16,332
No! I’ve come to right your wrongs!

3399
02:48:16,332 --> 02:48:19,000
I’ve accepted this as my legacy!

3400
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Speedwagon!

3401
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:21,173
Right!

3402
02:48:21,173 --> 02:48:21,346
<i>Ironic, isn’t it? Now
you’re the have-not, JoJo!</i>

3403
02:48:21,346 --> 02:48:21,519
<i>I’ll suck you dry</i>

3404
02:48:21,519 --> 02:48:21,692
<i>Become my next meal!</i>

3405
02:48:21,692 --> 02:48:21,865
<i>I’ve lost so many loved ones but
their light lives on in me, Dio!</i>

3406
02:48:21,865 --> 02:48:22,038
<i>I’ve come to cleanse
your corrupted ambitions</i>

3407
02:48:22,038 --> 02:48:22,211
<i>Useless, useless, useless, useless!</i>

3408
02:48:22,211 --> 02:48:22,384
<i>I obtained this power</i>

3409
02:48:22,384 --> 02:48:22,557
<i>My heart’s aflame</i>

3410
02:48:22,557 --> 02:48:22,730
<i>So I could steal everything from you</i>

3411
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:22,903
<i>I’ll dull this pain</i>

3412
02:48:22,903 --> 02:48:23,076
<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

3413
02:48:23,076 --> 02:48:23,249
<i>You were just like me,
two sides of the same coin</i>

3414
02:48:23,249 --> 02:48:23,422
<i>Like fire and ice, my body is burning</i>

3415
02:48:23,422 --> 02:48:23,595
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

3416
02:48:23,595 --> 02:48:23,768
<i>JOJO: You’ll kill me
DIO: I’ll kill you</i>

3417
02:48:23,768 --> 02:48:23,941
Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

3418
02:48:23,941 --> 02:48:24,114
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

3419
02:48:24,114 --> 02:48:24,287
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3420
02:48:24,287 --> 02:48:24,460
Not a chance!

3421
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:24,633
You fools!

3422
02:48:24,633 --> 02:48:24,806
What! The sword is freezing—

3423
02:48:24,806 --> 02:48:25,000
Utterly pathetic!

3424
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Mr. Joestar!

3425
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
<i>I obtained this power</i>

3426
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000

<i>If you think about it, you’re just like me</i>

3430
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,833
<i>You were just like me,

3431
02:49:10,833 --> 02:49:14,666

3432
02:49:14,666 --> 02:49:18,499
<i>JOJO: I’ll kill you
DIO: You’ll kill me</i>

3433

3434

Just like Mr. Zeppeli taught me!

3435
02:49:26,165 --> 02:49:30,000
I’ll channel my ripple through this sword!

3436
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
You did it! You defeated Dio!

3437
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,111

3438
02:49:35,111 --> 02:49:38,222
You fools!

3439
02:49:38,222 --> 02:49:41,333
What! The sword is freezing—

3440
02:49:41,333 --> 02:49:44,444
Utterly pathetic!

3441
02:49:44,444 --> 02:49:47,555
Mr. Joestar!

3442
02:49:47,555 --> 02:49:50,666
JoJo!

3443
02:49:50,666 --> 02:49:53,777
<i>Utterly pathetic! I’m grasping
your carotid artery, JoJo!</i>

3444
02:49:53,777 --> 02:49:56,888
<i>With this, you’ll become
one of my undead servants</i>

3445
02:49:56,888 --> 02:50:00,000
<i>Ironic, isn’t it, Dio?</i>

3446
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:07,000
<i>Just as I thought, you were
running away from humanity</i>

3447
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:13,000
<i>Why don’t you freeze me now, Dio!</i>

3448
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:13,142
My fist... Just from hitting him!

3449
02:50:13,142 --> 02:50:13,284
I transcended humanity!
None of you are on my level.

3450
02:50:13,284 --> 02:50:13,426
<i>You’re nothing but a monkey, JoJo!</i>

3451
02:50:13,426 --> 02:50:13,568
<i>JOJO: No, for as long as I have faith,
DIO: Compared to me, Dio!</i>

3452
02:50:13,568 --> 02:50:13,710
<i>DIO: Let’s test your willpower
JOJO: I will reach you!</i>

3453
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:13,852
<i>As long as we have faith, we can grow</i>

3454
02:50:13,852 --> 02:50:13,994
<i>JOJO: Us humans...

3455

<i>JOJO: That’s what he taught me
DIO: You can’t reach me!</i>

3456
02:50:14,136 --> 02:50:14,278

JOJO: I’ll burn up this body to prove it</i>

3458
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:14,562
He put his hand in the
fire! If he does that—

3459
02:50:14,562 --> 02:50:14,704
<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3460
02:50:14,704 --> 02:50:14,846
<i>My lost friends, my father’s spirit</i>

3461
02:50:14,846 --> 02:50:14,988

DIO: Even when I’ve thrown away my humanity</i>

3463

<i>Like fire and ice</i>

3464
02:50:15,272 --> 02:50:15,414
<i>With my life on the

3465

<i>-Dio! Dio! Dio!
-JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

3466

<i>I won’t stop beating you

3472

This is impossible!

3473
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:16,692
The heat is coursing through me!

3474
02:50:16,692 --> 02:50:16,834
I’m melting!

3475
02:50:16,834 --> 02:50:17,000
Crumble to dust!

3476
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000

I can’t wait to hear all about it!

3546
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
America, how nice!

3547
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I wanna go there too,

3548
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And try to dig up some oil for myself!

3549
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Damn it...

3550
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But after this, a fateful
moment was soon to come...

3551
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
This story will be passed down
until the world has come full circle.

3552
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That will be the life’s work
of Speedwagon the meddler...

3553
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But, the one to tell you what
happens right now won’t be me...

3554
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>I pray that today will never end</i>

3555
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>In the midst of a carousel of stars</i>

3556
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>

3557
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
What’s wrong?

3558
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
When you’re next to me...

3559
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I’m happy!

3560
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I feel the same.

3561
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I wish you could’ve met my father...

3562
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Well, let’s go and eat!

3563
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Jonathan?

3564
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s...

3565
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Erina,

3566
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Go back to our cabin.

3567
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Don’t forget to lock the door!

3568
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I have lured him here.

3569
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
My body...

3570
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Have you come?

3571
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Dio...

3572
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
JoJo...

3573
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I dare show myself in this pitiful
state in front of you for a reason...

3574
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I used to despise you so much,

3575
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
But now I respect you...

3576
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s because I’ve realised something!

3577
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
If there is a God that controls fate,

3578
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Then there’s never been a relationship
orchestrated as perfectly as ours...

3579
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
You’re the reason I got this power,

3580
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And you’re the reason why...

3581
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
The world has slipped from my grasp!

3582
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
When will it...

3583
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Be enough for you?

3584
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
That’s exactly what our destiny is!

3585
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I’ll obtain the body of the one and
only person I respect in this world.

3586
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And live in eternal glory!

3587
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
JoJo...

3588
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
You and I...

3589
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Are one and the same in this world!

3590
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Lord Dio! Look, look, look!

3591
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Please look!

3592
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Jonathan!

3593
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:37,888
<i>From light to darkness</i>

3594
02:53:37,888 --> 02:53:38,776
<i>This is the start of my mythos</i>

3595
02:53:38,776 --> 02:53:39,664
<i>I will end it all</i>

3596
02:53:39,664 --> 02:53:40,552
<i>And restart it all</i>

3597
02:53:40,552 --> 02:53:41,440
<i>For this is Dio’s World!</i>

3598
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:42,328
Right, Erina Joestar?

3599
02:53:42,328 --> 02:53:43,216
Dio!

3600
02:53:43,216 --> 02:53:44,104
<i>I can’t speak—can’t breathe—</i>

3601
02:53:44,104 --> 02:53:45,000
<i>My ripple!</i>

3602
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Erina! Not you too!

3603
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I’ll always be there for you!

3604
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
If you’re in trouble, I’ll rush anywhere!

3605
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Happy honeymoon!

3606
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I can’t wait to hear all about it!

3607
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
America, how nice!

Damn it...

02:54:36,690 --> 02:54:38,228
What’s wrong?

3619
02:54:38,228 --> 02:54:39,766
When you’re next to me...

Erina,

<i>Let my hand always be in yours</i>

That’s...

3636
02:55:11,100 --> 02:55:11,400
Erina,

3637
02:55:11,400 --> 02:55:11,700
Go back to our cabin.

3638

Don’t forget to lock the door!

3639
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,000

thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...

have come this far is really thanks to...

03:05:00,796 --> 03:05:06,488
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.

4074
03:05:06,488 --> 03:05:12,180
And foremost, the people
who came every day—

4075
03:05:12,180 --> 03:05:17,872
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—

4076
03:05:17,872 --> 03:05:23,564
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.

4077
03:05:23,564 --> 03:05:29,256
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.

4078
03:05:29,256 --> 03:05:34,948
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.

4079
03:05:34,948 --> 03:05:40,640
From the bottom of my heart,

4080
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:46,332
Pow.

4081
03:05:46,332 --> 03:05:52,024
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!

4082
03:05:52,024 --> 03:05:57,716
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.

4083
03:05:57,716 --> 03:06:03,408
Thank you for today!

4084
03:06:03,408 --> 03:06:09,100
Did you have fun, everyone?!

4085
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:14,792
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.

4086
03:06:14,792 --> 03:06:20,484
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.

4087
03:06:20,484 --> 03:06:26,176
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.

4088
03:06:26,176 --> 03:06:31,868
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.

4089
03:06:31,868 --> 03:06:37,560
I—are you worried?

4090
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:43,252
Nah, it’s probably okay.

4091
03:06:43,252 --> 03:06:48,944
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!

4092
03:06:48,944 --> 03:06:54,636
-He’s—that’s in the past.

4093
03:06:54,636 --> 03:07:00,328
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.

4094
03:07:00,328 --> 03:07:06,020
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.

4095
03:07:06,020 --> 03:07:11,712
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,

4096
03:07:11,712 --> 03:07:17,404
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.

4097
03:07:17,404 --> 03:07:23,096
And I’m relieved that we made it.

4098
03:07:23,096 --> 03:07:28,788
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!

4099
03:07:28,788 --> 03:07:34,480
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.

4100
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:40,172
But when we made it to opening day,

4101
03:07:40,172 --> 03:07:45,864
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,

4102
03:07:45,864 --> 03:07:51,556
Which has continued up through today.

4103
03:07:51,556 --> 03:07:57,248
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.

4104
03:07:57,248 --> 03:08:02,940
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.

4105
03:08:02,940 --> 03:08:08,632
For having supported us up to this point.

4106
03:08:08,632 --> 03:08:14,324
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.

4107
03:08:14,324 --> 03:08:20,016
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?

4108
03:08:20,016 --> 03:08:25,708
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.

4109
03:08:25,708 --> 03:08:31,400
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.

4110
03:08:31,400 --> 03:08:37,092
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!

4111
03:08:37,092 --> 03:08:42,784
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.

4112
03:08:42,784 --> 03:08:48,476
Excuse yourself...

4113
03:08:48,476 --> 03:08:54,168
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.

4114
03:08:54,168 --> 03:08:59,860
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.

4115
03:08:59,860 --> 03:09:05,552
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.

4116
03:09:05,552 --> 03:09:11,244
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.

4117
03:09:11,244 --> 03:09:16,936
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.

4118
03:09:16,936 --> 03:09:22,628
You were just that wonderful.

4119
03:09:22,628 --> 03:09:28,320
[INAUDIBLE]

4120
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:34,012
MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...

4121
03:09:34,012 --> 03:09:39,704
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—

4122
03:09:39,704 --> 03:09:45,396
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.

4123
03:09:45,396 --> 03:09:51,088
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.

4124
03:09:51,088 --> 03:09:56,780
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.

4125
03:09:56,780 --> 03:10:02,472
Thank you everyone in the cast!

4126
03:10:02,472 --> 03:10:08,164
It was wonderful. Thanks!

4127
03:10:08,164 --> 03:10:13,856
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

4128
03:10:13,856 --> 03:10:19,548
Now to everyone at the theatre,

4129
03:10:19,548 --> 03:10:25,240
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

4130
03:10:25,240 --> 03:10:31,000
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

4131
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
Thanks!

4132
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
Thank you everyone in the cast!

4133
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:35,600
It was wonderful. Thanks!

4134
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:37,200
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!

4135
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:38,800
Now to everyone at the theatre,

4136
03:12:38,800 --> 03:12:40,400
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—

4137
03:12:40,400 --> 03:12:42,000
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

4138
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:43,600
Thanks!

4139
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,200
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.

4140
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:46,800
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!

4141
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:48,400
Everyone, do your best!

4142
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:50,000
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!

4143
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:51,600
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?

4144
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:53,200
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!

4145
03:12:53,200 --> 03:12:54,800
I’m gonna watch it too!

4146
03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:56,400
Yeah, I’ll watch too.

4147
03:12:56,400 --> 03:12:58,000
Pardon me.

4148
03:12:58,000 --> 03:12:59,600
And so, please support everyone
through tomorrow’s final performance!

4149
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:01,200
Truly, thank you for today!

4150
03:13:01,200 --> 03:13:02,800
{\an8}[TN: Everyone’s muted for about 2 min]

4151
03:13:02,800 --> 03:13:04,400
[INAUDIBLE]

4152
03:13:04,400 --> 03:13:06,000
MAMORU: It’s already over.

4153
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:07,600
[INAUDIBLE]

4154
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:09,200
Thank you! Thank you!

4155
03:13:09,200 --> 03:13:10,800
Definitely, please support
tomorrow’s performance too!

4156
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:12,400
Shotaro, do your best tomorrow!

4157
03:13:12,400 --> 03:13:14,000
MAMORU: Do your best!

4158
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Thank you!

4159
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Thank you! Thank you!
