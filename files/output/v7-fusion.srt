1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is already on the screen.

2
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,440
It's okay to talk

3
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,180
Yeah

4
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,180
Are you okay

5
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
It's okay

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
You, watching this.

7
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
yes

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,560
It's you guys

9
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
You have been chosen.

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,680
I’ve decided you’re worthy
of being confided in.

11
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
I have this record

12
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,080
I leave my will to those who will inherit it.

13
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
From now on I

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,800
Heading to the ruins in Mexico

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
49 years

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,840
Time that had stopped has started to move again

17
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
It has started moving

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
That's why now

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,000
This record must be kept.

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,680
If something should
happen to me, I—

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
no

22
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Back to the story.

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
As you all know,

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,480
This foundation is for the benefit of humanity.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,800
Pharmacy

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
High school studies, etc.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,520
It was established with the aim of providing support in a variety of fields.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
On the surface

29
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
On the surface,

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Now, listen carefully.

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,240
I founded this foundation here in the United States and have branches all over the world.

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,880
It's to pursue the secret of something.

33
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,520
What is that something?

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Stone Mask

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
The true purpose of the foundation
is to solve the secret of the Stone Mask.

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,320
And today, I'm recording the story of the mask.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,200
And also to tell you the story
of the golden spirit I once knew.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,600
So that you can inherit it.

39
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
It began in the 16th century

40
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,280
tribes of the central plateau of Mexico

41
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,880
The husband of the sun who speaks the voice of time

42
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Founded by a tribe of Ahtecs

43
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,080
I have the power of life, eternal power, eternal life in my hands.

44
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
TRUE

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:54,160
What will become life next? I suck the blood of life, and life is power in my hands.

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
We are children of the sun

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Afteca

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
was disliked

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
However, at some point, that
tribe abruptly disappeared.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The mystery of this disappearance
lies in the Stone Mask.

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is the story of how the Stone Mask

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The strange fate of two boys and their adventure begins.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To do this, first

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
1868

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Speaking from the outskirts of London

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Watcher

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ouch, the rain is on my heart

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I need to dry it quickly.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll warm you up, Hey Kelly

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I won't sleep until the morning today

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're really cute

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait a minute, what's that?

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Isn't that Basa?

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No one has gathered yet. No one has come.

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, I'll be the first one there.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
wait a minute

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey, I don't want to get involved with you, sir.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you selling, rich Basa, aristocrat.

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm going to find some treasure.

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This guy is an instant death

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a beautiful necklace, I'll take it.

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There must be something good in this box

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What is this, your evil mask, I don't need this

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My husband is pregnant and the baby is alive.

75
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Baby, I don't want to get involved with that

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We want valuables! Val-u-ables!

77
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't have a nice ring?

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you doing?

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A person's misfortune is

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's about making someone happy

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Look, find it

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Kachulke

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good faction

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Aren't you a good guy?

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This guy sells for more than the stab shop.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The one who bites the stab is a nobleman, this guy is also a nobleman

87
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nothing wrong

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Look, find it

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's start with the top leaves

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You... Did you rescue us...?

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are my wife and son...?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
His wife had already passed away

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The baby is safe

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
baby

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I helped

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is this fate?

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to thank you for saving my life

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
My name is Joestar

99
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will never forget your kindness!

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's not worth mentioning, but

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
brand

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
ah

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Who is it?

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Brand Tower Jazz

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Time passed and in 1880

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The time was filled with enthusiasm

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A fierce storm

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Burning with desire

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The times fill

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now is the time

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Grab the money in your hands

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Time to leave

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The base of the castle is also high

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Open the horizon

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Still in the Darkness

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Crawl

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Fill it up

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
To stop the hand

119
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
A voice, a familiar voice

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
here we go

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He looked like he was going to ask me who I was

122
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me introduce you to something you've never heard of.

123

Immediately

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
While leaving it loud

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll tell you too

What's happening

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll teach you

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This country now

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have hope

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let the light burn, let the light burn today too

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Everyone comes to pray in the dark night

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I need to be aware of that weakness

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Light, resentment, light, darkness

Damn, you're dead!

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I said it because it was trendy and sweet.

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Your mamma is

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It was Jodaba!

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I wish I'd offered that woman for sale to you!

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Dio!

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Dio!

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Can't you hear me?

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Dio!

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What is it, Dad?

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is it medicine?

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't need medicine

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I have something important to tell you, come here

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Dio

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've known for a long time

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Memories after I die

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's all about you, my only son.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This, this, accept

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Give

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Joestar

211
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He's an aristocrat.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Moreover, Osotoyoshino

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He owes me a debt of gratitude.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay?

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
When I die, send that letter.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Go to that guy

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They take care of me.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll be back at school

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's good.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Cut it properly and stick it on.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Dad

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you acting like a father now?

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Listen, Dio

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You are smart.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I won't lose to anyone

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Become the richest

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Dio!

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How about girls?

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Ask yourself

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It keeps getting stolen

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I see

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Of losers

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Shake hands

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's hell now

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Nausea

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Still, my mother

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Be noble

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let go of your pride

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He hugged me

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey Dio

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Look up at the stars

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My mother keeps saying that

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
died of illness

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
easily

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There's nothing in general

246
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Not only will it be stolen

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What a star

248
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Do you have it?

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is that sky blue?

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Nacho Star

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ugly, terrible father, loser, always a loser

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Under this murky sky, I continued to struggle and die

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's receive our inheritance now, it's all from our parents, let's go on a journey

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:06,000
<i>I may have nothing in my hands yet,</i>

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Joestar, you have the sun in the sky

256
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's right, Joestar

257
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Your family is a doctor, but they're making money

258
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Your father is a good doctor

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What do you think?

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But it's an expensive hat

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Stop it, your mother gave it to you for your birthday.

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Stop

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What are you doing?

264
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Just because you're in front of a girl, you're trying to act cool

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hey, do you know who this is?

266
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If it was Jona from the Joestar family, he would be more ruthless.

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If he’s that Jonathan kid
from the Joestar family,

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The rich aristocrats shouldn't just stand there and act all high and mighty.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
what?

270
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hey, let's go

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Um, are you okay?

272
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Leave me alone

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
but

274
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I did it because I wanted to, not to be thanked by you.

275
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm aiming for true sincerity. You were a girl and I was having trouble with you, so I just stood up to you.

276
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Someday I'll be able to win

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay, let's go

278
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Jonathan Joestar

279
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Jonathan Joestar

280
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey Danny, Danny

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
you

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You must be Dio Brando!

283
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So you're Jonathan Joestar?

284
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Everyone calls me JoJo. Nice to meet you!

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Looking forward to working with you.

286
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Let me introduce you to my friend Danny.

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a very useful shape.

288
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It won't bite so it's okay.

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Friend?

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Danny!

291
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What are you doing? I won't forgive you!

292
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We’ve been waiting for you, Dio Brando.

293
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Lord Joestar!

294
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Come in. This is the mansion where you will be living from today onwards.

295
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What's up, JoJo?

296
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You’ve travelled all the way from
London, Dio. You must be tired.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,760
From today onwards, you are part of our family. Please live your life just like our son, Jojo.

298
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,000
I am grateful for your
kindness, Lord Joestar.

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,540
Hehehehe.

300
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,540
I’m Police Inspector Archer!

301
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,760
Police? Has something happened?

302
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,640
Yes, no, I've known Lord Joestar for a long time.

303
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,840
I heard Danny crying earlier.

304
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,480
It came over suddenly, so the teacher was surprised and it ended up hitting my leg.

305
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,520
Danny is an excellent watchdog for the Joestar family.

306
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.

307
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,000
JoJo, enough about Danny.

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,360
Yes, sir.

309
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!

310
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,300
Make sure to get along with each other.

311
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.

312
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Mister Brando!

313
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,440
Hehehehe.

314
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,160
Nice to have met you!

315
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,560
Hehehehehehehehehe.

316
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,720
See you, JoJo.

317
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Yeah.

318
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,520
So this is me.

319
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,400
Gearsk!

320
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,120
Don’t touch my bag!

321
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,420
I was just trying to carry it for—

322
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,120
結構

323
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,020
Your hand is covered in dog drool.

324
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,120
Sorry

325
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,120
I don't want you to touch me.

326
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,420
Listen, JoJo

327
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,320
Let me start by saying

328
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,220
I like number one the most

329
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,820
I won't let anyone act intimidating in front of me.

330
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
I was only trying to be friendly!

331
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,320
What are you two doing?

332
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
One more thing

333
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I hate dogs

334
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
The attitude of those who fawn over humans

335
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
The insects are running

336
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Don't let that stupid dog get close to me

337
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Sir Josser

338
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
i am coming

339
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
thus

340
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
The two boys meet

341
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
The two of them begin their youth

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Also

343
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Here comes JoJo

344
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Dioc

345
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Is that okay?

346
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
We are

347
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
As a highly respected aristocrat

348
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
real

349
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Gentlemen

350
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Make your goal your mission

351
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
for that

352
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I have to learn

353
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Take care of yourself

354
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
You have to be smart

355
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Logic

356
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Terrified

357
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
To not lose

358
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Under the Goddess of Self-Love

359
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Whatever happens

360
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
To reign

361
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Those born together

362
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
JoJo

363
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
JoJo

364
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Same again

365
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
I was wrong.

366
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
How many times has this happened?

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
This is the sixth time.

368
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,120
All uses are correct

369
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
I liked reading books

370
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
This much

371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Still looking good

372
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Even though I haven't learned it yet

373
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Is that okay?

374
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
We are

375
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,120
As a proud aristocrat

376
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
real

377
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
Gentlemen

378
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
And maybe

379
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Be quiet

380
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Stretch your vagina

381
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
beautifully

382
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Supple

383
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
It's always

384
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
beautifully

385
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Don't forget

386
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Under the Goddess of Self-Love

387
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Whatever happens

388
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
To be loved

389
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
As a proud aristocrat

390
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Harmful information

391
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
JoJo

392
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
nevertheless

393
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Is it sincere?

394
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Use of oneself

395
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
graceful

396
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
ironware

397
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,120
The perfect supporter

398
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Put away the girl's dishes

399
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
It's okay to eat

400
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
No meals

401
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Use

402
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Follow their example

403
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I

404
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Embarrassing

405
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
You

406
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I was spoiled

407
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Such

408
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
My mother prepared it for me.

409
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I always tried to correct my preaching.

410
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You see, we are nobles of high birth.

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Always question philosophy and truth in your mind

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There are two knights in English folklore.

413
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.

414
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.

415
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”

416
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Here's the problem for both of you

417
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
yes

418
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;

419
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Is what you see beyond the prison bars the mud in front of you?

420
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?

421
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Which do you think?

422
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Stars or Mud?

423
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I think I saw mud

424
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Why do you think so?

425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.

426
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
If you're dead, you can't accomplish anything.

427
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So no matter how many plans I had, I felt I had to live and do something.

428
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think I was looking at the stars

429
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
You lived your life to the fullest, and your two noble names will be engraved in history.

430
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So

431
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So

432
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
How you lived, how things happened, cherish that

433
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
That soul-dissolving powerlessness

435
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
All they saw was mud.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
They teach us lessons about what we can do with our lives.

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
They were proud to the end, they were looking at the stars

438
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I think it teaches us how to live our lives.

439
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You are an aristocrat, you have what you have, you live by taking it.

440
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?

441
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I

442
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There’s no right answer to this question.

443
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is that okay?

444
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
People live in the silence of fate, so they reach out their hands

445
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Are you seeing stars or mud? Call both justice.

446
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I stepped in next to him, the winner is Choma-san, Choma-san, the new champion!

447
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Ta-da! I trained with Danny!

448
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?

449
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.

450
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
His name is Dio Brando!

451
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
How about getting to know your new friends by getting them involved in our games?

452
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay! Let's do it!

453
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—

454
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If this is the rule, I'll throw it away if I do it in London!

455
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Gong down!

456
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Go, Jar Jarz!

457
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,320
Yay!

458
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
What a movement!

459
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,000
I've never seen that before!

460
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
Wow, Charger!

461
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
Can't get through!

462
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
perfection!

463
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I got in!

464
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Charger!

465
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Can't get through!

466
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Can't get through!

467
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Can't get through!

468
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
What a wonderful opportunity!

469
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Darstand!

470
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Everyone, Mina

471
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I think my finger went in his eye.

472
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I lost because of a foul.

473
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm sorry I'm late today

474
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Dio was amazing!

475
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
How do you do that move?

476
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
everyone

477
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It hurts

478
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Danny

479
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
For some reason, Dio is trying to trap me.

480
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I feel like I'm being invaded more and more

481
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Hey Danny, my heart hurts

482
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm full of anxiety

483
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
If I were to die like this

484
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Will everyone cry?

485
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You're always warm

486
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Thank you for being by my side

487
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>

488
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Is this how you loved me?

489
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You're a little

490
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
My handkerchief

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Hey, thanks for the handkerchief

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll be here in the morning too

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you'd like, come too.

494
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Danny

495
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Are you curious?

496
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Sorry for touching you without permission.

497
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It doesn't matter, the stone mask was apparently excavated from an archaeological site in Mexico.

498
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Mexico

499
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I bought it at an art gallery in London when Jojo was just born.

500
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
On the way back, he had a carriage accident.

501
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It was when your father helped me.

502
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Are you interested?

503
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
In particular

504
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Jojo always goes out with Danny.

505
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Danny has a friendship and trust for Jojo.

506
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you have a friend dog?

507
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I bought Danny when Jojo was little.

508
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
At first, I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It didn't work out with Jojo either.

510
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But one time Jojo drowned in the river.

511
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
My voice is all alone and no one can hear it

512
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Just as she was about to die, a shadow heard her scream and jumped into the river. It was Danny.

513
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Danny jumped into the river and saved Jojo's life.

514
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Danny's courageous actions, knowing what life is

515
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Young Jojo was touched by Danny's courage and courage.

516
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,600
They are best friends.

517
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,840
is that so

518
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,600
Husband

519
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Ah, that's right.

520
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
親友

521
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,440
Elna

522
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Joe John

523
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,000
The two were reunited

524
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,400
love

525
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,880
That wonderful curiosity led Jojo to action.

526
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,560
Immediately the two

527
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
I fell in love

528
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
Danny

529
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Come on over

530
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,880
You're so smart

531
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
You have to separate the core properly before eating it.

532
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,080
Hey Jo John, what have you been digging up lately?

533
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,080
No, nothing.

534
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,280
Why hide it?

535
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,880
It's so boring

536
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,680
If you say so, I really want to see it

537
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,480
People will laugh

538
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
I won't laugh

539
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
I'll tell someone

540
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,680
I won't tell you, so show me

541
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
No.

542
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
Joe John

543
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,080
Elna

544
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
Just call

545
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Feelings

546
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,480
Rest in peace

547
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,880
What kind of music

548
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,680
To that sound

549
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm falling in love

550
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,080
What's going well

551
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,880
I'm laughing like that now

552
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Vivid River Pool

553
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,480
The sky gets higher

554
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,280
Elna

555
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,880
Joe John

556
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,880
The joy of being there

557
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,080
The clouds are proud

558
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,280
The wind is a little sweet

559
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,480
Joe John

560
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,880
Elna

561
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,080
I'm short of words

562
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,080
These feelings are overflowing

563
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,280
forever

564
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,680
One word: I'm happy

565
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,880
I want to hear

566
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,480
With your voice

567
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,880
This is ticklish

568
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,080
you

569
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,880
Bad person

570
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,880
I don't know

571
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm being asked by you

572
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,080
So give me a reason

573
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,280
The reason for the two of us

574
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Hands and

575
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,880
My hands

576
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Unable to connect, we are lost

577
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,080
Continues into tomorrow

578
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,280
This little courage

579
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Trembling Heart

580
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,280
People who get excited

581
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,080
attract

582
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,280
Pale

583
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,280
question

584
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,080
It's already this late

585
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
Because a customer is coming today

586
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
I need to hurry back.

587
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Elna

588
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,280
see you tomorrow

589
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Joe John

590
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Strongly attracted

591
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,280
That name of yours

592
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Jonathan Joestar

593
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Erina Pendleton

594
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,280
or

595
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,280
It's Erina Pendleton

596
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
Today is

597
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Apparently he and Jojo were playing together

598
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
that

599
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
something

600
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
ray

601
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,280
I did it

602
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
As expected of Dion

603
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
What we can't do

604
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Do it calmly

605
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
I'm numb there

606
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Admire

607
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Have you kissed JoJo yet?

608
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Not yet

609
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
My first partner wasn't JoJo.

610
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
This is Dio

611
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
What does it mean if you're a lady?

612
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You understand, right?

613
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This guy

614
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
This woman

615
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Are you deliberately washing it with mud?

616
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Are you stupid?

617
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What are you sleeping for?

618
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Why did they give me alcohol?

619
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Who do you think is helping you eat?

620
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
This idiot

621
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Now buy me some alcohol

622
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Mom and Dad are a little unwell

623
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What are you pretending to be sick for?

624
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Can you hear this?

625
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Dad, stop it.

626
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Mom

627
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I was wrong, please forgive me

628
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's food, I can't take it anymore

629
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I was abandoned by the moon

630
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm a useless guy

631
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
If push comes to shove, I'll need you to work too.

632
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Wake up

633
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm counting on you

634
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Stop it

635
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Can you hear me?

636
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
My voice

637
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
A voice calling you

638
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You buy the alcohol

639
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I already have money

640
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
what

641
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Will you rebel?

642
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You can make this much money too

643
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
At least save up money to buy medicine.

644
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
There's a lot of flesh and blood

645
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
How proud do you think I am to work?

646
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
This stupid

647
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This guy is making fun of everyone, really.

648
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
With the money I had taken from that nobleman

649
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yes, he's good at it.

650
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I need to write a letter.

651
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
different

652
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I am

653
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
With you

654
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Dio

655
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Dio

656
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Why?

657
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Why is this happening?

658
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Hurt her

659
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Who am I?

660
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
What did you do?

661
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Why?

662
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Dio!

663
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You are amazing

664
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Much more than me

665
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I respect that.

666
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But in my heart

667
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
One thing is for sure

668
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There is something burning

669
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Dio

670
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
People's names are very passionate

671
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I won't forgive you

672
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I heard that

673
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
My love

674
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
About me etc.

675
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't care

676
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Stand up to it

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Even if we can't beat each other

678
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I can't lose

679
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Emotions

680
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Dominate

681
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Not like him

682
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Trembling Heart

683
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Her Honor

684
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Get it back

685
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Dio

686
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
fair and square

687
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
smash

688
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I'll make you understand

689
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
New power

690
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It comes up

691
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It feels good

692
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
This heart

693
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You gave me

694
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Dio

695
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You

696
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You

697
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Until I cry

698
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Hit

699
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Throwing money

700
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
How dare you

701
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Towards me

702
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Dirty

703
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This idiot

704
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Like this

705
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
To someone who seems to win

706
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
This me

707
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
This Dio

708
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like this

709
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
To a scumbag

710
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This me

711
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
This Dio

712
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
What on earth is going on?

713
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Both of you, go back to the punishment room!

714
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Dio,

715
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Your stupid kiss worked better than expected!

716
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
…

717
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
How miserable and painful,

718
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
This is the first time I've ever felt this way!

719
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Erina!

720
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Elina,

721
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Have you said goodbye to all your friends?

722
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yes, Dad.

723
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'm sorry, but it's due to my work schedule.

724
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
With all due respect...

725
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's go.

726
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
You'll make friends over there too.

727
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I gradually began to look down on them.

728
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
His explosive power,

729
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That mental strength.

730
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
If we don't grow more,

731
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So that we can be proud of our sincerity,

732
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
If you don't control your mind more calmly,

733
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
To get it all.

734
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But...

735
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What's that sound?

736
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Is there someone in the depolarizing furnace?

737
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Are you trying to go outside?

738
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
No!

739
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Oh my goodness!

740
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Someone! Someone please come!

741
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Then Perseverance, times changed,

742
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Riding behind Bistorias,

743
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The population is growing to the point of overflowing,

744
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The praise showered on the arts and entertainment,

745
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
In a flow that no one can stop,

746
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Turbulent and dissolving development,

747
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
The pinnacle of British culture

748
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
After the summit, it's downhill,

749
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Top runner,

750
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
human history,

751
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
human history,

752
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
human history,

753
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
human history,

754
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
human history,

755
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
After that it's downhill,

756
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Top runner,

757
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The judge will be counted,

758
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Rondo piece with index finger,

759
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
The port's days are filled with new and old,

760
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
A map of London with great ideas,

761
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just like the current situation in that country,

762
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Focusing on the darkness,

763
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
The swaying curtains of Galta,

764
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Portobello,

765
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
A new market.

766
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Is that correct?

767
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Stone mask unearthed in Mexico.

768
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I think it was Mexico

769
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It was a long time ago,

770
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Until you clarify!

771
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yay!

772
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
But you're right, sir.

773
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
The gentleman's wife was very fond of him,

774
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
They bought it from me at a good price.

775
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Okay, done.

776
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
We did it.

777
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And where is this gentleman now?

778
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That seems a little suspicious.

779
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What are you all about?

780
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's rude.

781
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
My name is Sephiri.

782
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's a danshaku.

783
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I came from Italy in pursuit of the Stone Mask.

784
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
All the way from Italy?

785
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I think they said he was a northern aristocrat.

786
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm just going to check the ledger,

787
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Please wait.

788
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Gratz.

789
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Let me give you a bit of advice,

790
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
The sun will soon set.

791
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You'd better not cross that street.

792
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It mists.

793
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Thank you for watching.

794
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:21,500
I don't want to reach for my suit and fall towards the red

795
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,800
Beautiful and dirty mix together and the night drinks pile up

796
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:40,200
Abandoned by resignation, I lean close to you and shake your hand

797
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:48,000
This darkness is different from other countries

798
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,600
Something is wrong. People are swaying in the river and being carried away.

799
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:03,400
Give me a warmth Kisaki Jack

800
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:11,200
Hate the poor, hate the rich,

801
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,000
Let's all gather here now, Jack.

802
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:29,800
In 1887, the Trafalda pair raised their voices in equality.

803
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:37,800
From afar, the rich look on and laugh at your profession and life

804
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Accelerate steadily

805
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Let's all gather here now, Jack.

806
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,600
In 1887, the Trafalda pair raised their voices, saying, "Your profession, your life,

807
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Accelerate steadily

808
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Let's all gather here now, Jack.

809
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,400
I got it! The one who snatched the fangs away was my most noble hero, Jonathan Joe Turner!

810
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Full moon, spaceship, if public opinion falls, move forward into the future

811
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Is it today? Where is it here? On top of which castle?

812
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Will I really be able to live here? New memories exist here now

813
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Look again someday, you'll see, you won't find

814
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Now here, a full moon, a spaceship, if public opinion falls, move forward into the future

815
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Is it today? Where is it here? On top of which castle? Move forward into the future

816
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Joe Joe, your pass doesn't look like it.

817
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Try! We won the last game!

818
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Jo Jo! That was amazing!

819
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,400
Thanks to your pass! Let's first tell Dad about this victory!

820
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,400
Maa Jo Jo!

821
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Hey! Can I write about your friendship in the school newspaper?

822
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Thank you. Please go ahead and change and wait for me. Let's go home together.

823
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Time passed like unsolicited water

824
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Ever since you started calling me Dad

825
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:47,400
I think of those words that have become familiar to me

826
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Seven Years of Prefectural Production

827
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:02,400
You were beautiful and sincere

828
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,400
I straighten my collar, thinking of my friend

829
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,400
You regretted your mistake of not wearing your collar.

830
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:24,400
In place of Tani, you supported me

831
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Ahead of me was your back

832
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,400
We walked together for seven years

833
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:47,400
But why don't I feel any friendship towards you?

834
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,400
How are you feeling thanks?

835
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Just the wind has come this far

836
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,500
If this is taking so long, I'm getting old.

837
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
It's still today

838
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Oh yeah, that's a big deal.

839
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,500
Jojo and Dio Plant, they won.

840
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,500
Dio is already a member of the Joestar family.

841
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Jojo has become a fine gentleman.

842
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,500
He submitted a brilliant thesis in the field of high school studies.

843
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,500
Dio graduated with the highest grades in law.

844
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,500
I respect you

845
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Back then...

846
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,500
Husband

847
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
I just got home

848
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Dio, welcome home

849
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
And Jojo too

850
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,500
Dad, are you okay?

851
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,500
The seats don't stop

852
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Today the doctor recommended I be admitted to hospital.

853
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
I'm against it.

854
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Hospitals these days are all about making money.

855
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Apparently it's a problem in London too.

856
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,500
It's certainly safer at home

857
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,500
I refused.

858
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:36,500
The trembling in your hands and the pain in your chest will go away.

859
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,500
Congratulations to both of you on your wins

860
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
Oh, you already know that?

861
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Inspector Archer there told me.

862
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
That's terrible, Inspector.

863
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,500
We want to see our father's happy face

864
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
Even though he came flying

865
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Damn

866
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Really big nose

867
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,500
They are wonderful sons.

868
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Especially D.O., you did really well.

869
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,500
When you graduate, you can be whatever you want to be.

870
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,500
He gave me a chance even though I was born poor.

871
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
thank you

872
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
So, I'll leave it at that.

873
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Thank you for always coming, Inspector.

874
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
With the appearance of Jack the Ripper, the world has become a dangerous place.

875
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,500
No, this is Liverpool.

876
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,500
There are people everywhere who lack the sense of right and wrong like him.

877
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Well then, excuse me.

878
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
…

879
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,500
It responds only to blood and operates with a precise mechanism.

880
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Who on earth did this and for what purpose?

881
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,500
If we can solve this mystery, it might spark something new in the Japanese Language Society.

882
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,500
If that happens, then there must be some destiny for this stone that my mother bought.

883
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,500
This is Dario Pland

884
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,500
I'm always sorry, Dio.

885
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
It's easy to give medicine

886
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,500
thank you

887
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,500
I don't want to get older

888
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
I am currently ill

889
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,500
You'll probably die.

890
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:13,500
My heart hurts, my hands shake, and the stones won't stop.

891
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Can't you hear me?

892
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,500
A voice calling you

893
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,500
My mother died, and my father and I

894
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,500
Yes, whatever happens with that scum

895
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,500
I have endured

896
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,500
Yes, until that day

897
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:59,500
He's dead, and the moon has abandoned us. Damn it.

898
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Yeah, I'm gonna beat this guy up and drink now.

899
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
The only one

900
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,700
I threw that thing at you and trampled on you

901
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't need it anymore

902
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:23,300
My mother was killed by him, and everything was taken from her.

903
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,000
Can you endure it, Tia?

904
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Your blood flows through my body in this hell

905
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Punish this curse, take it all into your hands

906
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:51,500
Keep winning until the very end of humanity

907
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:57,000
Be prepared and take action

908
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Wear a mask and become a brand, father

909
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Sleep with the past in a perfect world

910
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Get it

911
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Tia

912
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Tia

913
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Tia

914
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,000
What happened to the medicine now?

915
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What's wrong Jojo?

916
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
A letter from your father seven years ago.

917
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
The detailed document from your father's deathbed is here.

918
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Wow

919
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Let me see it.

920
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
My father and the girl are the same

921
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You always brought medicine to my father.

922
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What are you saying?

923
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Answer me

924
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
What on earth are you trying to say?

925
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Give me the medicine back!

926
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
JoJo

927
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
To examine this drug

928
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
to doubt our friendship

929
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Tia

930
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I swear to you in all sincerity and on the honor of your father, Mr. Brand.

931
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
My own innocence

932
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I swear to my father I'll never talk about this again

933
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I swear to him

934
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Tia

935
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
A vow

936
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
A vow

937
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
A vow

938
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I swear

939
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
oath

940
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I swear to you, Tia

941
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Is there any honor in that lottery?

942
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Give me back that medicine

943
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Tia

944
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I won't let you near my father anymore.

945
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Changed to the core

946
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
We never had a friendship from the start

947
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I will protect JoJo

948
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It's a misunderstanding, JoJo

949
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's a misunderstanding

950
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And

951
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
There's no evidence.

952
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
It's just a guess

953
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
yes

954
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I hated my father

955
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Above all, I was suspicious

956
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I've become selfish

957
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
JoJo

958
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
JoJo

959
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
JoJo

960
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
What did you do, Tia?

961
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
no

962
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's okay

963
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I can't pull anymore

964
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
A perfect world

965
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Get it

966
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Tia

967
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
father

968
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
What's going on, JoJo?

969
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Speaking out loud like that

970
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
father

971
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I'm going to London for a couple of days.

972
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Meanwhile, the doctors I hired

973
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I decided to provide perfect care.

974
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Except from them

975
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Please do not take this as medicine or tia.

976
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
but

977
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Let me do what I want

978
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know why

979
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I

980
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I believe in my son

981
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
father

982
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
thank you

983
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
7 years ago

984
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
This guy

985
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It reacted to my blood and activated

986
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Use this guy

987
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
It was disguised as a research accident.

988
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Hey, your research will kill you

989
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The time limit is tight, so prepare yourself and take off

990
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Looking up at the stars in search of a laxative

991
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Aiming for the end of the world, East End of London

992
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
This place I followed is in the mud

993
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Augustus Golito, where the plague comes

994
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This place in front of me is the other side of the world

995
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
There's a reason we need to move forward

996
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Even if you lose this right hand, look at the stars

997
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It's finally time to choose

998
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This is me and the smell

999
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Who will come wading through the sea?

1000
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The me of that time

1001
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:34,000
August Golito Devours Everything

1002
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Augustus Golito, the end of everything

1003
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't know what's come

1004
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There must have been something called "Shosan"

1005
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Kokosuku even devours it

1006
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
We are the Augurs

1007
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's no problem if you don't know the world

1008
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Just tell me a simple truth

1009
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Hey hey hey

1010
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
My cousin's son

1011
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
This knife is sharp

1012
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'm not going to get into the costume.

1013
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
If you tend to do that, you'll end up showing your innocence

1014
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I am Augustus Golito

1015
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It goes without saying that we are cheats

1016
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The have-nots take the haves

1017
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Life is an Auger

1018
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Even my heart was stolen

1019
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It seems like it would be safe if we ran away first

1020
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
High Cattongaren

1021
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Augustus Gorrit

1022
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It can even take your life

1023
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't mind losing this finger

1024
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Augustus Gorrit

1025
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Our Imcrony

1026
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I have

1027
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You'll lose your fingers too

1028
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah, maybe just one person

1029
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Augustus Gorrit

1030
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Proud of that resolve and deceive

1031
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I've been looking for Quornini

1032
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Don't bluff

1033
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Give the rich boy a try

1034
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Wilder Meow

1035
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I even blew my belly out

1036
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
The mood is also aligned

1037
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I ended up in the wrong town

1038
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Handling my end

1039
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Countdown

1040
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
3 2 1

1041
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
This Speed ​​Burgon was allowed, why didn't he kick with all his might?

1042
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I came here for my father.

1043
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.

1044
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I don't want to do anything that would disappoint your father.

1045
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I came here for your father.

1046
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.

1047
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I came here for your father.

1048
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That's why Kelsion doesn't want to do anything that would cause your father grief.

1049
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Tell me your name.

1050
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Jora, Joestar.

1051
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Joestar-san, please name the person playing the German role.

1052
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Be careful. They're tricky. Hey, treat your wounds.

1053
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
This Speed ​​Burgon will guide you to Minsei.

1054
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Why?

1055
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I like you.

1056
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Foca Street

1057
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
O man of resolve,

1058
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Foca Street

1059
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Continue taking a look

1060
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You who see the stars in your heart

1061
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
O courageous one,

1062
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
With a courageous heart

1063
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Light up the darkness

1064
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
A complete cheers to Tsugatsugashin Sunland!

1065
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Cheers to this beloved destiny, this encounter!

1066
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Once the water is boiling, pour the water into the pot.

1067
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The water boiled.

1068
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Pour water into the water.

1069
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
The water boiled.

1070
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The water boiled.

1071
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The water boiled.

1072
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
The water boiled.

1073
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The water boiled.

1074
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The water boiled.

1075
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The water boiled.

1076
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
The water boiled.

1077
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
The water boiled.

1078
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I can't help but drink alcohol

1079
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Can't you hear my voice?

1080
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
A voice calling you

1081
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Shut up and don't come out

1082
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You are the only one who can see the sun

1083
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Become the richest

1084
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
The case is different between you and me

1085
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Where am I looking, Tanchiki?

1086
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Nyahaha are you listening to this?

1087
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
A blue-blooded kid

1088
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
When you go out,

1089
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Can't you hear my voice?

1090
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Can't you hear my voice?

1091
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
This idiot

1092
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
There is no trace of the Heisei era

1093
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Just Flosier from GG

1094
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
This idiot

1095
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Your help is

1096
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Human voice

1097
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I'll kill you

1098
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
A voice calling someone

1099
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's an interesting machine

1100
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Hey you idiot

1101
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
It's in my arms

1102
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Human experimentation

1103
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
JoeJoe

1104
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'll solve your research

1105
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
What

1106
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
What

1107
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
What is this light?

1108
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Hallucination?

1109
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Dead

1110
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
If you get stabbed in the head with this much force, it's only natural that you'll die instantly.

1111
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's an ancient instrument of torture and murder.

1112
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Not dead

1113
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Hiba, what is this guy?

1114
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Too angry

1115
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Murder Chronicles Kazakhstan

1116
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm tired of thinking

1117
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
not good

1118
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We can fight

1119
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,860
I hate that the sun I see is the last one I see!

1120
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,140
Thank goodness...

1121
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Did the sunlight turn it to ash?

1122
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
ah…

1123
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Ugh...

1124
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Ah...

1125
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Hahaha...

1126
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Damn...

1127
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
This is...

1128
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
The power of the Stone Mask...

1129
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So Dio...

1130
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
He hasn't returned from the liquor store yet.

1131
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Quickly chase after them...

1132
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Please use the room

1133
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
thank you

1134
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Hey!

1135
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Ah...

1136
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Take that Oriental, Wyche!

1137
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
yes!

1138
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Hahahaha...

1139
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Hahahaha...

1140
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
long…

1141
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Sorry...

1142
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
This is my fault...

1143
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
picture?

1144
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I…

1145
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
If only he'd stayed at Lutow's house...

1146
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,300
Dio's father, Dario Brando...

1147
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,200
That is what I mean.

1148
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,500
I'll tell you

1149
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,700
It's a story from when you were a baby

1150
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,000
Yes, this is my ring

1151
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,500
But no theft report was filed.

1152
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,200
A man was arrested for trying to put a ring into the seventh

1153
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,800
The ring was given to Sir Joster when he was betrothed to his wife.

1154
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,900
It was clear that this was a special pairing.

1155
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,700
Yes, this is the ring I made with my wife.

1156
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,100
Did you remember your wife today?

1157
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,200
He had tears in his eyes.

1158
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,500
I have caught the culprit

1159
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
Would you like to see me?

1160
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,100
Stealing something from a nobleman is a serious crime

1161
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,500
The punishment for fighting is certain.

1162
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,700
Got it

1163
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,000
Hey, hey

1164
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,900
Don't complain, Brand.

1165
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:17,900
brand

1166
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,300
Oh no, then

1167
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:23,900
Dario Brando is no lifesaver or anything.

1168
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,600
He's just a thief

1169
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,200
Sir Joster knew that.

1170
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,300
He adopted Dio.

1171
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,200
Why?

1172
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:38,100
I am moved to tears by the words and actions that followed today.

1173
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,200
Didn't he say this to you?

1174
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,900
This ring was given to me

1175
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:51,700
Yes, I said

1176
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:52,900
Uh, yeah

1177
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:53,800
It's not a lie

1178
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,100
This is what I gave to him

1179
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,500
He is innocent

1180
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,300
It's one half of your wife.

1181
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:03,400
Brand-san

1182
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,000
yes

1183
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,800
This is yours

1184
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,100
Please give this ring to me and buy something for your family.

1185
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,700
Lord Joster, why did you do that?

1186
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:25,200
If I were suffering in poverty

1187
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:30,700
I would have done the same

1188
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:37,200
Yes, for the ones I love

1189
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,700
For the ones I love

1190
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,700
The stars in the sky are attracted to each other

1191
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:55,200
Soon, like a myth

1192
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:04,200
This light will clear the darkness

1193
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,800
Let us pray

1194
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,700
thank you

1195
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,000
You are too kind

1196
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,100
This villain is laughing inside

1197
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,400
Maybe so

1198
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,800
But think the other way around.

1199
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:36,800
From the music of destiny, people reach out to the stars

1200
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,800
Let's embrace that courage, that loneliness

1201
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:56,800
Pain is all connected

1202
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,800
Everything has meaning

1203
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:12,800
I am prepared to believe in humanity.

1204
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,800
If it falls, you can't see it, you see.

1205
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,800
it is

1206
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,800
Someday it will shine

1207
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,800
Inherited and turned into gold

1208
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:39,800
I'm ready to keep believing

1209
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:58,800
Curse your fate

1210
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,800
I'm waiting for D.

1211
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,800
It can still be stopped

1212
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:20,000
- Lyrics, composition, arrangement, lyrics, arrangement, composition, arrangement

1213
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:30,000
- Lyrics, composition, arrangement, music composition, arrangement, arrangement

1214
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
- I heard a strange rumor.

1215
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
- Floscia's man,

1216
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
- He reportedly broke the wall with his bare hands.

1217
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
- And then the man, in the morning sun,

1218
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
- It won't fit.

1219
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
- It disappeared.

1220
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
- It's the same as 30 years ago.

1221
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
- Just like back then.

1222
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
- In the wilderness of memory,

1223
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
- A smashed grass fire.

1224
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
- That sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean

1225
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
- It was blood red.

1226
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
- Full of passion,

1227
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
- I'm fascinated by the world of roads.

1228
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
- My respected father,

1229
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
- Crossed the seven seas.

1230
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
- Dear Father and Mother,

1231
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
- To my youth.

1232
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
- The Stone Mask is from my hand,

1233
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
- They took it all away.

1234
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
- Vowed vengeance,

1235
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
- To get it back,

1236
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:01,000
- Tomorrow for sure, tomorrow for sure.

1237
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
- I think about it day in and day out,

1238
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
-There's a saying that goes, "That's who he is."

1239
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
- Stone Mask, if you let me find it,

1240
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
- It will be irreversible.

1241
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
- This hand,

1242
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
- believe.

1243
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
- Young girl.

1244
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
- Young girl.

1245
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
- Did you come back from London?

1246
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
- I got the deciphering material.

1247
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
- Too bad, Dio.

1248
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
- Really.

1249
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
- You may not understand, but this is the truth.

1250
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
- I understand, girl.

1251
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
- That's the kind of guy you are.

1252
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
- I know this is selfish, but I have a favor to ask.

1253
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
- This is the last one.

1254
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
- Can you give me some time?

1255
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
- To the police,

1256
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
- Time for independence.

1257
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
- I,

1258
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
- I regret my life.

1259
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
- Born into a poor family,

1260
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
- I got ambitious.

1261
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
- I did something stupid.

1262
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
- Sin,

1263
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
- I was making amends.

1264
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
- Don't believe it.

1265
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
- His words.

1266
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
- picture?

1267
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
- Everyone has a dirty look on their face.

1268
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
- Let me introduce myself.

1269
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
- I'm Speed ​​Oagon, the busybody.

1270
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
- I've been in the dark sea since I was born,

1271
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I've seen a lot of bad guys.

1272
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
- So you can tell by the smell.

1273
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
- This one's a habit.

1274
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
- It smells like vore.

1275
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
- This guy is born evil.

1276
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
- Mr. Joestar, just hand it over roughly.

1277
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
- We already have the evidence.

1278
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,360
Dad, I heard the whole story.

1279
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,880
I decide to rest in the bedroom

1280
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,880
My son

1281
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:34,320
I don't want to see him get caught. That guy won't get caught.

1282
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:39,320
I was born with that fate

1283
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:49,200
I get it, Jojo. You'll get arrested, but at least...

1284
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:55,040
I want you to put handcuffs on me. We've been together for seven years.

1285
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,720
Be careful why

1286
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,640
Got it

1287
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,240
I'll put the handcuffs on

1288
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:12,640
Humans have limitations

1289
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:18,640
I've figured it out

1290
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,640
The more Oro blooms, the more

1291
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,640
The limits of life

1292
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:34,640
Hey JoJo, I'm so frustrated

1293
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:40,640
There's nothing in these hands

1294
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:47,640
The prison where I was imprisoned

1295
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
Covered in mud

1296
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,640
No matter how much I struggle, I can't see the stars

1297
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,640
My eyes are closed

1298
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:07,640
Do you understand that murky sky?

1299
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,640
These hands are crushing me, they can't reach me

1300
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:17,640
This beautiful blood that has been JoJo

1301
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,640
Even after vomiting, this blood won't go away

1302
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,640
So now is the time to break this cage

1303
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:31,640
Catch the Stars

1304
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,640
And I

1305
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,640
Mother

1306
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,640
Humans

1307
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:01,640
I'm quitting

1308
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:06,640
JoJo

1309
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,640
throat

1310
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:13,640
Okay.

1311
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:18,640
Shoot

1312
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,640
Shoot

1313
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,640
Shoot

1314
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,640
JoJo

1315
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:33,640
Hey, doctor, call a doctor

1316
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,640
Dad, Dad

1317
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:59,640
Gradually, this is my dead mother's ring. I'll be happy if I come.

1318
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:07,640
Don't begrudge me the reason

1319
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:17,640
Maybe being strict with you made you feel unfair.

1320
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:28,640
Anyway

1321
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,640
Not bad

1322
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:57,640
Gradually, the end came in my son's arms.

1323
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:02,640
Oh my god

1324
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,640
It was definitely a mistake back then

1325
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,640
When you die, everything

1326
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Damn it, Mr. Joestar

1327
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I was always told to be sincere.

1328
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Always proudly

1329
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I said I'd save you

1330
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I was told I believed

1331
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you

1332
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
What is sincerity?

1333
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Dad, open your chest

1334
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
What are you proud of?

1335
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
What's the purpose

1336
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The Joestar blood that flows through my body

1337
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Always remained sincere

1338
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Be proud and understand yourself

1339
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Ready to cut through the dark wilderness

1340
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Look up at the stars and accept it all

1341
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Engrave this will in your mind

1342
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Be proud of your heart and shine golden

1343
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Let's become the future and send it to the stars

1344
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,000
The Joestar blood that flows through my body

1345
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Everything is connected and everything has meaning

1346
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Resisting this fate and sadness

1347
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:30,000
A single drop of courage

1348
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Police work is tough

1349
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
what up

1350
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That's the corpse

1351
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Dio's body is missing

1352
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
What?

1353
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Police Officer, get away from the window.

1354
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
What's up with this guy?

1355
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I'm back to life

1356
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Even though I was shot so many times

1357
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Be careful

1358
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Someone has a weapon

1359
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,000
No way

1360
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Dio

1361
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
stop

1362
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Shoot me

1363
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Don't help me

1364
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
quickly

1365
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
I don't know

1366
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Just what's happening now

1367
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Jaja

1368
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Can you hear me?

1369
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
you

1370
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
JoJo!

1371
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I am

1372
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I have gained such great power

1373
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
From Stone Mask

1374
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Your father's power

1375
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Do monsters create monsters?

1376
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Run, Mr. Josser.

1377
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
That's how it works.

1378
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
There's nothing we can do about that monster

1379
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
How about it?

1380
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
It's no wonder that God has lost some unknown ability from his brain.

1381
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
So then

1382
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
If you completely destroy the head

1383
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Stop it

1384
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Look!

1385
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
more

1386
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
It's stronger

1387
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Turon...

1388
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,700
above ーーー!

1389
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:33,400
Poor, poor!

1390
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,400
Mr. Joestar!

1391
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:42,400
Just a little longer, just a little longer, I'll enjoy this wonderful power.

1392
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:48,400
I still don't know how far I can go!

1393
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,400
JoeJoe

1394
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,400
Oh, JoJo

1395
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,400
Stop your pointless struggle

1396
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,400
I told you!

1397
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:19,400
The more you try to come up with a plan, the more you realize there are limitations to what humans can do.

1398
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:26,400
Don't hide in the shadows of the curtains, come out

1399
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:33,400
You too will become my life!

1400
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,400
Dion! It's not strategy that will stop you, it's courage!

1401
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:48,400
You can't defeat him this day, Speedwagon, you run from the mansion!

1402
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,400
Joestar-san! Don't run away to the top!

1403
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:10,400
The running flames illuminate the darkness

1404
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:16,400
Come on up, Dion! I'm here.

1405
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:22,400
Are you inviting me, JoJo? Okay, you go first.

1406
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:28,400
Shining light on the running flames

1407
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,400
I will end you, your power, here

1408
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,400
It's no use, it's no use! Let's suck the life out of it

1409
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,400
Flickering flames, don't let them fall!

1410
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:51,400
Let's offer light to the other side!

1411
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:56,400
After you gave me your power

1412
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,400
Your back was always ahead of me

1413
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:04,400
You were always on my back

1414
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,400
My youth is with you

1415
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,400
Settlement in this era

1416
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:17,400
Jojo, the Joestar mansion burns down

1417
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:22,400
Under the map, everything is lost

1418
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:30,400
Burn everything except this life

1419
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,400
I'll finish you

1420
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:44,400
This is what Joestar must be thinking

1421
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:50,400
The stronger the firepower, the more the monster's recovery power can't keep up.

1422
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,400
More, more firepower

1423
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,400
But the flames have reached the roof

1424
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,400
Damn it, Mr. Joestar

1425
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:13,400
Woolly

1426
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:31,400
Woolly

1427
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:43,400
This body is immortal, you are the only one who will die.

1428
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:55,400
How the goddess of Jillary shines

1429
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:00,400
Give me loving judgment in your heart

1430
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,400
I won't let go of this knife

1431
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,400
You're closed off, it's a knife.

1432
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
It's no use, I'm immortal

1433
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,400
Jillary

1434
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:16,340
The power of hell

1435
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:21,220
The Goddess of Giving Love Sways in Flames

1436
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:25,720
Apply equal force and justice

1437
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:36,320
This isn't how it should be, the sacred goddess

1438
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:47,000
The power of hell

1439
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Goddess of Giving Love

1440
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
The power of hell

1441
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Goddess of Giving Love

1442
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Can you hear me?

1443
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I can hear you

1444
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
in front

1445
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I told you about the Astika people.

1446
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
That is

1447
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
It was a 13th-century mistake, not a 16th-century one.

1448
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Even though we are in a position where we must accurately tell the story,

1449
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I'm very sorry.

1450
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Someone also said

1451
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I don't want to get old

1452
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
by the way

1453
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Did you take a proper break?

1454
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
good

1455
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I am a storyteller

1456
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I have been a witness to many different human situations.

1457
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And I kept saying

1458
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I want all the acrylic stands

1459
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I completed it

1460
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Now

1461
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Shall we talk a little more?

1462
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
The story so far seems a bit like a fairy tale

1463
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
It's definitely a reality

1464
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And from here too

1465
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
So strange.

1466
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:35,000
At that time, the mansion was engulfed in flames and collapsed.

1467
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
But Joestar was alive.

1468
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I beat Dion.

1469
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
But I lost everything

1470
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
after that

1471
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
3 days

1472
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
1 day

1473
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
2 days

1474
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
3 days

1475
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
4th

1476
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
5 days

1477
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
6th

1478
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
7th

1479
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
8th

1480
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
9th

1481
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
10th

1482
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
11th

1483
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
12th

1484
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
13th

1485
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
14th

1486
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
15th

1487
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
16th

1488
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
17th

1489
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
18th

1490
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
19th

1491
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
20th

1492
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
21st

1493
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
22nd

1494
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
23rd

1495
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
24th

1496
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
25th

1497
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
27th

1498
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
28th

1499
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
29th

1500
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
30th

1501
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
31st

1502
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
32nd

1503
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
33rd

1504
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
34th

1505
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
35th

1506
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
36th

1507
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
37th

1508
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
38 days

1509
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
39 days

1510
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
40 days

1511
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
41 days

1512
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
42 days

1513
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
43 days

1514
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
That's why I came!

1515
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Nursing is done well.

1516
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Please come back at a later date.

1517
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Are you okay?

1518
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Oh, wait a minute.

1519
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Sigh...

1520
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I am...

1521
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Huh...

1522
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
…

1523
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
…

1524
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
…

1525
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
…

1526
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
…

1527
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
…

1528
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
…

1529
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
…

1530
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
…

1531
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
…

1532
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I slept for three whole days straight.

1533
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Everyone in the mansion

1534
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Please stay calm now

1535
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
We've passed the peak, but it's still a tough time.

1536
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I'm glad you're alive

1537
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
You've been nursing me

1538
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
you

1539
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
No way

1540
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
But they look similar

1541
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Who said we look alike?

1542
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
To Elina Pendleton

1543
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
picture?

1544
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's been a while

1545
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Jonathan Joestar

1546
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Why?

1547
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
This is my father's hospital

1548
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I moved to India seven years ago.

1549
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I recently returned to Japan.

1550
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
It's really been a while

1551
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I was weak

1552
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I couldn't run to you

1553
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I was a young child.

1554
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I couldn't face you

1555
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That voice remains unchanged

1556
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
These unchanging feelings

1557
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Vivid rebab

1558
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The sky gets higher

1559
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Elina Jojos

1560
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
The joy of being there

1561
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,000
The clouds are proud

1562
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,000
The wind is a little sweet

1563
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Erina!

1564
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
sorry

1565
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
I relaxed and lost consciousness

1566
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
With my broken arm

1567
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I'll always support you

1568
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Eye to eye

1569
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
If you touch it, it's there

1570
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
A little courage

1571
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Continues into tomorrow

1572
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Hand in hand

1573
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Touch and there

1574
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Fate comes into contact

1575
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
forever

1576
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,000
My heart is trembling now

1577
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
overlap

1578
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Faintly attracted to each other

1579
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
A continuation of that day

1580
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
The two

1581
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
destiny

1582
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
yes

1583
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Meeting people is

1584
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Maybe it's decided by fate

1585
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Speedwagon is cool

1586
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!

1587
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
It's a misunderstanding!

1588
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Wait, it's the murderer

1589
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
The method was the same woman's throat.

1590
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Slash

1591
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,000
The method was the same woman's throat.

1592
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Slash

1593
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
That belly is a face

1594
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Ammo is the worst

1595
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
The identity of the synchronized person is completely unknown

1596
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I can't grasp the truth

1597
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Like you

1598
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Don't walk outside at night

1599
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Like you

1600
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Performance

1601
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Ah, it's already this late, I have to go home quickly.

1602
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It's still this late

1603
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
But Jack the Ripper might show up.

1604
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Scary

1605
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
It's scary.

1606
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Now you're talking to him

1607
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
picture?

1608
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:28,000
I played late into the night and got depraved

1609
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Who is it?

1610
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I like you

1611
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Because I was seen

1612
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
I feel no pain, I have nothing to fear

1613
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Now that I've been reborn, I'll start my life

1614
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
If we don't heal the wounds, we need lives.

1615
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And the fulfilling game is weak

1616
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Don't you want power?

1617
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I will bestow power and pleasure.

1618
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Humans are bound by Zennartaga and fear great evil.

1619
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,000
However, in rare cases, there are evil elites who have no Zennartagha.

1620
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Me, you, how about you come with me, Dio?

1621
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
What do you know about me?

1622
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Bokarsachak, you must be angry.

1623
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,000
A woman drowning in fun, a woman covered in happiness

1624
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Defeat more, fear no more

1625
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I will bestow power and pleasure.

1626
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Jack, no more worries, more pleasure in your hands

1627
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I have no fear

1628
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Bad Earth, how many times have I been zeroed out?

1629
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
You come with me, Jack, Zalipa.

1630
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Take my hand, who are you?

1631
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Whether to look at the time or what to look at, there are enough words to

1632
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Welcome me, I can't reach you

1633
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I'm living my life, the sun is already gone

1634
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death

1635
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:06,000
This world

1636
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
That stone gana

1637
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I want to believe that, like the others, I have become a powder keg.

1638
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I think so, yes

1639
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's okay, it's okay

1640
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
let's go

1641
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
That

1642
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
what happened?

1643
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Who is it?

1644
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I've been here for a while now

1645
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Jonathan Joestar

1646
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
and Miss Elida Pendleton

1647
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,720
BGM

1648
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:15,480
I'm surprised I survived

1649
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:17,360
Is that Ishikamen's power?

1650
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,200
Ishikamen!

1651
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,200
BGM

1652
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:21,880
chance!

1653
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:24,720
BGM

1654
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:25,720
departure!

1655
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:26,720
BGM

1656
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,040
Ash

1657
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:29,160
BGM

1658
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:30,360
All Air

1659
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,880
BGM

1660
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,920
Not bad at all

1661
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:34,920
Death

1662
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,320
Are you getting worse?

1663
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,840
BGM

1664
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:37,600
What?

1665
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,120
A compound fractured arm

1666
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:39,800
BGM

1667
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,400
No pain

1668
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,040
I am Zeppeli bullet scale

1669
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,440
Courage alone is not enough to win

1670
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:48,160
Ishikamen's Power

1671
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:51,080
I'm on your side

1672
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,400
Control your breathing

1673
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:55,760
Your breathing erased the pain

1674
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,840
I'm on your side

1675
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,280
It's Jola San Jose.

1676
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,760
BGM

1677
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,120
there is nothing

1678
01:56:02,120 --> 01:56:03,480
What did you do?

1679
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,800
Why did you say my name?

1680
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,080
Please ask your questions one at a time.

1681
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,760
I'll show you the answer

1682
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:13,200
Follow me

1683
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:15,000
Then

1684
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,320
Fate changes

1685
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:19,880
Whether to accept

1686
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:21,720
It's up to you

1687
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,160
What happens next?

1688
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:35,360
If this breathing occurs

1689
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:39,480
Let me show you now

1690
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,680
With a special breath

1691
01:56:51,680 --> 01:56:53,960
Special endorsement

1692
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,720
The blood carries

1693
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:58,720
The body burns the bifnech

1694
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,240
Energy is generated

1695
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,360
The name is

1696
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,440
Hamon Energy

1697
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:22,040
The power of Hamon is transmitted

1698
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:25,880
This miracle happened

1699
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:29,640
This is the power of Hamon

1700
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,000
Breathing brings

1701
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
The power of blood

1702
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,640
Everyone has a blood flow

1703
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:44,720
It gives you just a little bit of energy

1704
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:45,760
Transporting nutrients

1705
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,520
Regulating body temperature

1706
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,640
Hamon's power is that small energy

1707
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:51,760
Collected from the whole body

1708
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:53,360
What makes this possible is

1709
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,720
It's a rhythm of breathing.

1710
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,000
Breathing is the power of now

1711
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Yes, the power of breathing

1712
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Yes I know

1713
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
This breath, both inside and out

1714
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
About the Stone Mask

1715
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
And about you and Dio

1716
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Dio

1717
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,000
The mask can only be worn by those who haven't changed.

1718
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Rio the Stone Masked Man

1719
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I still walk in the darkness

1720
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I travel the world

1721
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I followed the mask

1722
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
To destroy

1723
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Dio is alive

1724
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
If we don't fight

1725
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
If you don't destroy it

1726
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Jamon in your hand

1727
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Otherwise

1728
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
You and the world

1729
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Fate is in motion

1730
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I finally found it

1731
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Do you accept it?

1732
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
This fate

1733
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Everything is lifted up

1734
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
That's it

1735
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
supermarket

1736
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
supermarket

1737
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
supermarket

1738
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:16,000
destiny

1739
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
fight

1740
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
That's my destiny

1741
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Me and Dio

1742
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The individual body of the Stone Mask

1743
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Unlocking the unknown power of your brain

1744
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Turning humans into vampires

1745
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
it is

1746
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
You must take blood energy from others.

1747
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
On the other hand, Hamon's power

1748
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
From your own bloodstream

1749
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
To draw out energy

1750
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Front and back

1751
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Same energy

1752
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Yeah

1753
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
In other words

1754
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
To remove this jamon

1755
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
What do you think I should do?

1756
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I'm starting to understand

1757
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Hamon. Hit them with another kind of hamon and they'll shatter.

1758
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And these energy waves have the same shape as sunlight.

1759
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
The power to defeat Dio.

1760
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Yes. Time is running out. Learn how to turn courage into strength.

1761
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Jojo, Dio.

1762
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Eina, I can't get you involved.

1763
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
I just want you to nod now.

1764
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I'll definitely come back to this place.

1765
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Is this the Hamon from JoJo?

1766
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
…

1767
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:34,000
The clouds flow, the wind leaves thoughts behind

1768
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
go around

1769
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I nodded.

1770
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
To your resolve

1771
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
In sadness

1772
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:58,000
The stars are attracted to each other

1773
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Guided by the destiny I love

1774
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Caught in the mud

1775
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I'm floating here

1776
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Left behind

1777
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Living the dream, waiting by the window

1778
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:39,000
For whom is loneliness

1779
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Even if it doesn't reach

1780
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Even if you're not attracted to me now

1781
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I want to scream

1782
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
To be me

1783
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
You are attracted to each other

1784
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Always guided by fate

1785
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I weave the days together

1786
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Let's live

1787
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Looking up at the stars

1788
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
To this place

1789
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
You'll tell me someday

1790
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Stay proud

1791
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Accepting all of you

1792
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Destiny and Love

1793
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,000
So that we can call it that

1794
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
The stars are attracted to each other

1795
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Guided by the destiny I love

1796
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
The stars are attracted to each other

1797
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Wherever you are

1798
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I am me

1799
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Live on

1800
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Live on

1801
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Live on

1802
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Wang Chen, you're still alive?

1803
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
yes

1804
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,600
Ugh ugh ugh!

1805
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,300
Ah!

1806
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:13,800
Ah!

1807
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,300
Ah!

1808
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:14,800
Ah!

1809
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:16,800
Ugh ugh ugh!

1810
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:17,800
Hahaha!

1811
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,600
Ah!

1812
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:20,100
Ah!

1813
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,600
Ah!

1814
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:21,100
Ah!

1815
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:21,600
Ah!

1816
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:22,100
Ah!

1817
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:22,600
Haha!

1818
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:23,100
Ha!

1819
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:24,500
But it’s the same power!

1820
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:25,000
Haha!

1821
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
No way, that Dio guy

1822
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,000
SPEEEEEEEE!

1823
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,500
Wagum!

1824
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:35,300
You are,

1825
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,600
I know too much about the Stone Mask's secrets.

1826
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:40,600
It's Agarmaru!

1827
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:41,600
Mr. Joestar!

1828
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:46,600
You were looking too!

1829
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:49,600
Because, because! Dio-sama said so!

1830
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,600
I can lick your blood!

1831
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:57,600
Lick? Lick? Lick? Lick! Lick! Lick!

1832
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,600
Bello-san Joestar?

1833
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:03,600
Be careful JoJo, he's got some serious power.

1834
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,600
What's with this weird hat?

1835
02:06:05,600 --> 02:06:06,600
Grace

1836
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,600
Let's eat!

1837
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:08,700
Huh?

1838
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:11,600
Huh?

1839
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:13,620
My arms... flames

1840
02:06:13,620 --> 02:06:15,060
My arm...

1841
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,060
My arm...

1842
02:06:17,060 --> 02:06:18,240
My arm...

1843
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:20,840
My arm...

1844
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,460
My arm...

1845
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,880
My arm...

1846
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:27,380
My arm...

1847
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:30,120
My arm...

1848
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:31,280
My arm...

1849
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:32,540
My arm...

1850
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:33,940
My arm...

1851
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:35,360
My arm...

1852
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,160
My arm...

1853
02:06:36,160 --> 02:06:37,760
My arm...

1854
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,760
me

1855
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:50,400
It was

1856
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:56,340
I got a new life

1857
02:06:56,340 --> 02:06:59,880
Creating something that surpasses humanity

1858
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:07,540
If it's important, it's not here

1859
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:08,960
Or your body!

1860
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:12,940
It's hot! What's this?

1861
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:15,020
It's hot! It's hot!

1862
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,620
Oh! Wait a minute!

1863
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:23,260
Amazing, JoJo

1864
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:27,380
You've mastered Hamon in such a short time.

1865
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:31,820
what up?

1866
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:33,420
JoJo

1867
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:37,020
I lost my treasury

1868
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,340
So I wanted power

1869
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:42,860
But that

1870
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,540
Not the same as Dio

1871
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:46,620
To hurt someone

1872
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:49,420
It is fundamentally different from the power that is obtained by stealing.

1873
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:51,180
But it's the same power!

1874
02:07:54,380 --> 02:07:56,980
There is a proverb in the northern country of Norway:

1875
02:07:58,220 --> 02:08:00,860
The North Wind created the brave Viking

1876
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:04,100
A harsh north wind blows

1877
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:05,700
Because I know the pain

1878
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:07,740
A Viking with timber frame was born

1879
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:09,820
Not like them

1880
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:11,420
You

1881
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:13,460
I know the pain

1882
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:15,020
pain

1883
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:22,900
The pain of losing a friend

1884
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:26,940
The pain of inheriting pride

1885
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:32,340
The pain of the person you want to protect

1886
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:34,700
Proof of Life

1887
02:08:35,580 --> 02:08:37,220
Listen to the pain

1888
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:45,100
I was always told to be sincere.

1889
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:51,820
Always following my father's lead

1890
02:08:54,620 --> 02:09:01,540
I still don't know if it's true sincerity

1891
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:11,660
The Joestar's blood is hot and trembling

1892
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:18,660
The daily routine surface is dyed in a glowing red darkness

1893
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:23,100
That tragedy repeats itself

1894
02:09:23,580 --> 02:09:26,900
Holding this pain

1895
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:29,820
Is it a matter of daily routine?

1896
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,100
It was something I discovered by chance.

1897
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,500
What?

1898
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:42,020
A wedge driven into the wilderness of memory

1899
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:49,100
Once upon a time, I crossed the seven seas with my father

1900
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:52,420
Quiet Shore Night

1901
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:56,500
That mask emits light

1902
02:09:57,100 --> 02:10:03,540
58 of his comrades were killed.

1903
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:04,700
Severi

1904
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:09,940
A masked man comes

1905
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
It's the same as back then

1906
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
At this time, the morning sun of salvation shone

1907
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,000
It was my father

1908
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Illuminated by the red morning sun, my father disappeared

1909
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,000
My watch stopped then

1910
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Holding this pain

1911
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I've been chasing

1912
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Don't repeat

1913
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Vow revenge

1914
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Don't make me sad

1915
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Tomorrow will shine

1916
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:58,000
With pain

1917
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
What you need

1918
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
The courage to own the pain

1919
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
and

1920
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Ready to shoulder the burden

1921
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
JoJo

1922
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
The thought

1923
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I haven't forgotten

1924
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
yes

1925
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I believe in the power of this question.

1926
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
let's go

1927
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:34,000
【applause】

1928
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
JoJo

1929
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Joestar

1930
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Aha

1931
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Dio

1932
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
One

1933
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Where are you?

1934
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Ah, here it comes.

1935
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Otsuchi

1936
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Red Asahi

1937
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
He won't splash blood on me.

1938
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
a

1939
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Pacara

1940
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
this

1941
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
This is a horse.

1942
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
yes

1943
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
crackle crackle

1944
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Seriously?

1945
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
You're a horse too

1946
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
crackle crackle

1947
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:26,000
That guy

1948
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:32,000
That guy should be Yama-chan, the researcher finally got a grip on him.

1949
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Yeah yo yo, I'm off to pay off the accumulated debts

1950
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Represent the underworld AK Speed ​​is a detailed investigation by agreement

1951
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I'll be your guide, I'll show you the 16-bar showtime

1952
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
From London to the south, on the round land, we drove without rest in a carriage

1953
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
I can see that I can go to the Imishie Toner

1954
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Nara, a city on the shore

1955
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Wind Knight's Road Natural Fortress Maru

1956
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Wind Knight's Road The true nature of the fate is Dio's hideout

1957
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
The joy of taking action while the Sun King is still around

1958
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
While the Sun King is still there, clean up every month

1959
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Dio, you're so good at playing with your life.

1960
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Dio, come tomorrow to you, we'll defeat the end now

1961
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Thank you Speed ​​Ago I appreciate it

1962
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
The inside information was accurate. It seems that Tranchen has escaped further ahead.

1963
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Dio will build his empire here.

1964
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
If we can find him while the sun is still out

1965
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Enter the tunnel. This is the entrance to the city.

1966
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Arrived on schedule

1967
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Hey, giant carriage, why are you stopping the carriage?

1968
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Be careful, the sun doesn't reach here

1969
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Escape from Tranchen

1970
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Look, horse, horse

1971
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
What is this thing?

1972
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
The horses also slipped in easily.

1973
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Your blood

1974
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I'll give it a taste.

1975
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Jota, you two stay back.

1976
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I will fight

1977
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
JoJo, fighting spirit.

1978
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
It's growing

1979
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,000
This insect is a giant human being.

1980
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I'm challenging you to a fight

1981
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Can you call that courage?

1982
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
What are you talking about?

1983
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
What exactly is courage?

1984
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Disturbing breathing is scary

1985
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
If you overcome fear, your breathing will not become irregular

1986
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Ripple Cannon Attack

1987
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Goku is a product of courage

1988
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Human production is the production of courage

1989
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
The greatness of humanity is the greatness of courage

1990
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,000
No matter how strong

1991
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
These zombies don't know courage

1992
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Drinks and dollars

1993
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Dollars!

1994
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Hot! Hot!

1995
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
desire!

1996
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I can definitely kill you

1997
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
surely!

1998
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Pieces out!

1999
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I'll eat it

2000
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Hidden passage in the tunnel

2001
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Window Light Lot

2002
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
This is the knights' training ground

2003
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I hear there are a variety of tricks

2004
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
And there's a huge underground cemetery.

2005
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
He's inviting

2006
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Chasing makes you lazy

2007
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I'm sure Dio is up there

2008
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Dollars!

2009
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Can you hear me?

2010
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Sleeping Knights

2011
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Dollars!

2012
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Answer me

2013
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Tell the King Again

2014
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Let go of that grudge now

2015
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
It's erased history

2016
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Subverting justice

2017
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Win it all

2018
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
That's the world

2019
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Unwavering

2020
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
<i>This is Dio’s World!</i>

2021
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Dio's World

2022
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
The long silence

2023
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It has corrupted this country

2024
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Now is the time to speak up

2025
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
My throat has been blown

2026
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Scream from the mud

2027
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Drop that star

2028
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Let's allow that

2029
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Mytion!

2030
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Easy jewel!

2031
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Raise this voice

2032
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Rot in 300 years

2033
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Let it go behind you

2034
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Return in 300 years

2035
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
This one second

2036
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Wait, Dio

2037
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Come quickly, JoJo

2038
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I am

2039
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I got my world

2040
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Dollars!

2041
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Kill them all

2042
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Dollars!

2043
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Destroy it all

2044
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Even life is controlled

2045
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Breaking God's Word

2046
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Controlling history

2047
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I'll learn everything anew

2048
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Controlling Time

2049
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Beyond Eternity

2050
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Heavenly Command

2051
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Rule them all

2052
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
It's been a while

2053
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Live to the fullest

2054
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Acknowledge all

2055
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Justice is justice

2056
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,000
A country of justice and ulterior motives

2057
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Beyond Eternity

2058
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Rule them all

2059
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Song weaving

2060
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Seeking kindness

2061
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
My World

2062
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
This world

2063
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Dio's World

2064
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Laughter

2065
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Ah, it melts

2066
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
The dead melt so fast

2067
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
My cheeks melted and holes appeared

2068
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
The tongue pops out of the hole

2069
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,000
There's a hole in my cheek

2070
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:48,000
A tongue is sticking out of the hole

2071
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Jack!

2072
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Oh, that's true.

2073
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Dio!

2074
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Protruding

2075
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,000
The fire went out

2076
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Your lives too

2077
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
It's time to sink

2078
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I've been preparing for that moment

2079
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
But it makes me feel good

2080
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:15,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2081
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:25,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2082
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:36,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2083
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:46,200
Jojo Lessender The North Wind Created the Vikings

2084
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:51,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2085
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:59,200
The North Wind created the Vikings.

2086
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:09,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2087
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:18,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2088
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:28,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2089
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:38,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2090
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:40,200
Disturbed the universe

2091
02:21:44,200 --> 02:21:46,200
A similar wind is blowing

2092
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:48,200
Wine Harmony

2093
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:50,200
I feel it

2094
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:53,200
Sing the Darkness

2095
02:21:53,200 --> 02:21:55,200
The Serpent Gate Wave

2096
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,200
Resonate throughout your body

2097
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:59,200
Solar Universe

2098
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:02,200
Sing the Darkness

2099
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:06,200
My hands are shaking, Harmony

2100
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:12,200
Hautau fans will surely burn out

2101
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:14,200
Sunlight

2102
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:17,200
Yellow

2103
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
Over

2104
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,200
Don't do it

2105
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:27,200
Dollar Hive

2106
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,200
Wave Gate of the Sun

2107
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:31,200
Dio

2108
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,200
This is the power that will defeat you

2109
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,200
Dio Frando

2110
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,200
I don't know you personally

2111
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,200
But

2112
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,200
Against the stone wall that awakened your brain

2113
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,200
I dare say

2114
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,200
for now

2115
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,200
You

2116
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,200
I dare to say to the stone wall

2117
02:22:56,200 --> 02:22:58,200
We finally met

2118
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:00,200
Don't get on my head

2119
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,200
If I can heal this wound in my stomach

2120
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:11,200
JoeJoe

2121
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:17,200
It was attached to you

2122
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:18,200
that

2123
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:21,200
Fire injuries are detected

2124
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,200
With your lives

2125
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:29,200
I'll disinfect this wound with ultramarine

2126
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:31,200
you

2127
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:34,200
How many lives did that wound suck out of you?

2128
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,200
You

2129
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:47,200
Do you remember how many slices of bread you have eaten?

2130
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:56,200
I'll make you take root

2131
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:00,200
The blade of the sun

2132
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,200
bread

2133
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:06,200
Poor poor

2134
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:07,200
this is

2135
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,200
My arms are frozen

2136
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:11,200
The energy you radiate

2137
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,200
I thought it was blood related.

2138
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,200
I am

2139
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:17,200
You can control your body freely

2140
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:22,200
If you freeze your veins

2141
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
I can't use that power

2142
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,200
Don't disrupt your breathing

2143
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:27,200
Breathe

2144
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,200
Attack

2145
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,200
Waste, waste, waste, waste

2146
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:37,200
breathe?

2147
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:39,200
波紋?

2148
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,200
If you blow

2149
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:48,200
It would be fitting if they were playing a fanfare for me

2150
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:59,200
A poor friend that suits you

2151
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:00,200
What?

2152
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,200
fellow

2153
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:03,200
Yes.

2154
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:05,200
Do you remember?

2155
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:07,200
Someday

2156
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:09,200
Your father

2157
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
The story of the knight that my parents told

2158
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
what?

2159
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
16世紀

2160
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I

2161
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:23,000
The tragic queen sentenced to death

2162
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Mary Seward

2163
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I told there

2164
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Two people

2165
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,000
It's the story of a proud knight.

2166
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,000
My dad too

2167
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
yes

2168
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
We listened to it together, didn't we?

2169
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
JoeJoe

2170
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Dio

2171
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Today, this tradition is passed down in England.

2172
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Let's talk about two knights

2173
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,000
The spirit that descends downwards is alive

2174
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
A tale of knightly pride

2175
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
It was three hundred years ago

2176
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Two countries competing for support

2177
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Queen Elizabeth Suffers

2178
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Beautiful Mary Seward

2179
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,000
He gave the sword to Mary.

2180
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Two legendary heroes

2181
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Power with You

2182
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,000
It will happen again in the afterlife

2183
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Plaford Solo

2184
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Deliberate Heart

2185
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Shoot the shapeshifting enemy

2186
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Two people with no luck

2187
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I trained that strength

2188
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Looking for a stop

2189
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Finding comfort in Mary's self-love

2190
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Pledge your life

2191
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
But one day

2192
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Their mistress, Mary,

2193
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
By Elizabeth

2194
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
accused of murdering her husband

2195
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I'll be captured

2196
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
The two heroes are unstoppable

2197
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:20,000
To save Mary

2198
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
To stop the two heroes

2199
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Elizabeth calls out

2200
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Let your skin and blood live on

2201
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I will spare my master's life.

2202
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:47,000
There's no way we could refuse

2203
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:52,000
We have no regrets

2204
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:57,000
For this dear queen

2205
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
But he was about to be executed

2206
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I'll tell you about the maid's souvenir.

2207
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Your master is not imprisoned.

2208
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
You and I lost our heads

2209
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
That's her lying here like trash

2210
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Let's keep him alive

2211
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Because there is a risk of rebellion

2212
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:23,000
You betrayed me, Elizabeth.

2213
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I will curse you with this grudge

2214
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Curse forever

2215
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
The anger of the Eighth End makes human flesh like iron

2216
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I can't get through that neck

2217
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Her hair got tangled around Plaford's chest.

2218
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Like a living thing

2219
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I lived with this in mind

2220
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Knight's Tale

2221
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
A strong smell that gives you goosebumps

2222
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
What a loyalty

2223
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
But they should have done better.

2224
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
In the end, I couldn't do anything in the mud

2225
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
It could be said that it was a pointless death

2226
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
You may be right.

2227
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
But nothing is meaningless

2228
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
The same goes for when you came to this house.

2229
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
It's all connected

2230
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I want to believe they continued to see the stars.

2231
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:38,000
People live in a prison called fate

2232
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Reach out your hand there

2233
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Are you seeing stars?

2234
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Or somewhere

2235
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Both

2236
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Joe John

2237
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Dio

2238
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Call it justice

2239
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,940
Hahahahaha... those two...

2240
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:20,900
I made it into a weapon of revenge that can blow away even demons.

2241
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:23,640
I am...

2242
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:28,040
Even history can be your servant!

2243
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:28,840
No way...

2244
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:32,160
Hahahahahaha...

2245
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:34,480
Hahahaha...

2246
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:37,060
Oh no...

2247
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:39,060
Hahahaha

2248
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,060
What is this appearance?

2249
02:30:41,060 --> 02:30:43,060
To avenge a grudge

2250
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:45,060
What an embarrassing sight

2251
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:49,060
Don't you think so?

2252
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:51,060
Kill them all.

2253
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:55,060
A continuation of that day

2254
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:57,060
Tarkus

2255
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
Braford

2256
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:01,060
Let's scream "Fansfare"

2257
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:05,060
Above us

2258
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:07,060
Our

2259
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:09,060
Pride, the great wrestler Bruford

2260
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:11,060
and Tarkus

2261
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:13,060
Your thoughts and pride

2262
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:15,060
I can't imagine the resentment

2263
02:31:15,060 --> 02:31:17,060
But to me too

2264
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:19,060
There's something I'm carrying

2265
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:21,060
We're the ones who'll eat this guy.

2266
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:23,060
Cartilage

2267
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:25,060
It's delicious

2268
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:29,060
The man's pride

2269
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:31,060
I take it as a kiss

2270
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:33,060
My master

2271
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:35,060
I'm in Braford

2272
02:31:35,060 --> 02:31:37,060
The end of this brave man's life

2273
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:39,060
I want to draw

2274
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:41,060
Okay, that's good.

2275
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:43,060
Come on, it's a kiss duel

2276
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:49,060
Run away, both of you.

2277
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:51,060
Joe Stan

2278
02:31:51,060 --> 02:31:53,060
Tarkus

2279
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:55,060
I won't let you get in my way

2280
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:05,060
a

2281
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:13,060
In the wilderness of memory

2282
02:32:13,060 --> 02:32:15,060
Hit

2283
02:32:15,060 --> 02:32:17,060
smoking

2284
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:19,060
Atlantic

2285
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:21,060
That morning sun

2286
02:32:21,060 --> 02:32:23,060
It was red as blood

2287
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Osa

2288
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
You're not coming

2289
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,060
ah

2290
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:39,060
Fuck

2291
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,060
Fuck

2292
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:43,060
I can't do anything

2293
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:45,060
I'm already grateful

2294
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:47,060
I don't have anything

2295
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
I'm powerless

2296
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:51,060
Wait a minute

2297
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:53,060
Don't mess with me, even at a time like this

2298
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:55,060
Even if you give up, it still hurts

2299
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:57,060
Continue to deceive

2300
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:59,060
Tomorrow for sure

2301
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:01,060
Tomorrow for sure

2302
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:03,060
you

2303
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
Like I'm alive

2304
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:07,060
I kept chasing

2305
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:09,060
Let's make a tragedy

2306
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:11,060
Is revenge your identity?

2307
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,060
Is that your pride?

2308
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:15,060
What if

2309
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,060
Fight for your pride

2310
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:19,060
and

2311
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,060
If we win

2312
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:23,060
I hope you win

2313
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:25,060
What is your heart now?

2314
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,060
Let me shake it off

2315
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:29,060
It's not the pain that's scary

2316
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:31,060
What you should know

2317
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:33,060
regain

2318
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:35,060
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

2319
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:37,060
Tomorrow and now

2320
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,060
Osa

2321
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,060
Melt

2322
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:49,060
I came along to die

2323
02:33:49,060 --> 02:33:51,060
Speed ​​moves

2324
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:55,060
Now my heart

2325
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:57,060
Let me shake it off

2326
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:59,060
Look at you

2327
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:03,060
Someday tomorrow

2328
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:05,060
Don't wait

2329
02:34:05,060 --> 02:34:07,060
I start walking

2330
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
Should believe

2331
02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:15,060
Should be reclaimed

2332
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:19,060
Tomorrow

2333
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,060
now

2334
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060
I'll carve it

2335
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:31,060
Blood Beat

2336
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,060
you

2337
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:39,060
Please bring back that proud heart

2338
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:43,060
I am

2339
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:45,060
Black Knight

2340
02:34:45,060 --> 02:34:47,060
Branboard

2341
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,060
I like this

2342
02:34:49,060 --> 02:34:51,060
pain

2343
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Why doesn't it work?

2344
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:03,060
You just said pain

2345
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:05,060
You are feeling pain now

2346
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:09,060
pain

2347
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:17,000
So I stopped fighting with you

2348
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,000
So you stopped the sword

2349
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,000
You are a proud knight

2350
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Human

2351
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,000
The pain

2352
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Proof of Life

2353
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Is this a human?

2354
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Because there is pain

2355
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I can feel the joy of being here now

2356
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
A strange sense of peace

2357
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I feel now

2358
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Bravo

2359
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Let me make you follow the words engraved on my sword

2360
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Good luck

2361
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:19,000
And courage

2362
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
To save souls

2363
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
That I have to kill

2364
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
you

2365
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Queen Queen

2366
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
No way

2367
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Defeating the Black Knight

2368
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,000
also

2369
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,000
You are this Dio

2370
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Hey Baby

2371
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
The plant's jamon attack will tempt you.

2372
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
what

2373
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:19,000
More vulgar than a frog's argument

2374
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Hamon

2375
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
It's dangerous

2376
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:39,000
A knight's disgrace

2377
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:43,000
What's the point of not repaying your grudge?

2378
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:47,000
What is joy?

2379
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Queen

2380
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Queen

2381
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Queen

2382
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Victory!

2383
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:15,000
Victory is our pride

2384
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Damn it

2385
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I'll do it

2386
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Let's do it

2387
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Queen

2388
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
my

2389
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
The last jamon

2390
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Follow me

2391
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
My will

2392
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Queen

2393
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Collapse

2394
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:07,000
I'll destroy that evil spirit.

2395
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Sink into the darkness of history

2396
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Tarkus

2397
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Old man

2398
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Mr. Jepel

2399
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Mr. Jepel

2400
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
When you're gone

2401
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
If you are sad

2402
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Stone Mask

2403
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Destroying

2404
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Old man

2405
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
When you're gone

2406
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
If you are sad

2407
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Stone Mask

2408
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Destroying

2409
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Old man

2410
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Old man

2411
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
I

2412
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I'm satisfied with my life

2413
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
lastly

2414
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
My everything

2415
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
I entrusted it to you

2416
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Chocho

2417
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
You

2418
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
It's my hope

2419
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Old man

2420
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
this

2421
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Life spills out of my arms again

2422
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:30,000
You taught me my meaning and my destiny

2423
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:42,000
He taught me that the greatness of human beings is courage

2424
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:54,000
The light I receive will permeate my heart

2425
02:40:54,000 --> 02:41:02,000
It was like having a best friend and a son at the same time.

2426
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:07,000
From now on I will live inside you

2427
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
thank you

2428
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Everything is connected, everything has meaning

2429
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:33,000
This pain that I believed

2430
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:39,000
This pain

2431
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:52,000
What your father entrusted to you, what you entrusted to him

2432
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
The golden light inside me

2433
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:17,000
There is one certain thing that I want to release in my heart right now

2434
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Embrace it and escape from this prison

2435
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Seeing the stars, the golden heartbeat, the brilliance of humanity

2436
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I'll light up the darkness and come to you

2437
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:00,000
My hands to you

2438
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
girl

2439
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Okay, okay.

2440
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Can't you hear my voice, my voice calling out to you?

2441
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I can't hear it, I've already killed the past

2442
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Don't call me by my name, I'm not like you

2443
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Death has broken it, my son.

2444
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:21,000
It has been reborn, it remains the same, in order to live

2445
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:29,000
I'll use it all and entrust justice to you.

2446
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Win all, rule all

2447
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:47,000
I want something next, something I want

2448
02:44:48,000 --> 02:45:02,000
What I want is that is that is that is

2449
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Lyrics, composition, arrangement, and arrangement

2450
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Here it comes...JoeJoe...

2451
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Is this the world you wanted?

2452
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
what?

2453
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Is the world you lost long ago a pitiful one, surrounded by dead people like this?

2454
02:45:50,000 --> 02:46:00,000
It's a wonderful world where I control everything. Even death and history...

2455
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
And to do so, do we rob innocent people?

2456
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:13,000
It's a noble sacrifice for the future I envision.

2457
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:25,000
You're just scared. Humans... that's why I stopped being human.

2458
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:35,000
To obtain it, he went beyond humanity.

2459
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
I just ran away.

2460
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:47,000
All that matters is the results.

2461
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:57,000
The only outcome is that I win and dominate...

2462
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:01,000
It's all destined to be like that!

2463
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:02,000
different!

2464
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
It's about how you lived.

2465
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:15,000
What have you left behind by resisting fate?

2466
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
This symbol is...

2467
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:37,000
He gave me strength and then died.

2468
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:49,000
It's your father!

2469
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
That's right...

2470
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
It's something I can't do in all seriousness, but...

2471
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
The current Jonathan Joos...

2472
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
To get revenge!

2473
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I will kill you!

2474
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
You're the same too!

2475
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
That's how you get rid of your grudge!

2476
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
No! You've been in denial!

2477
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
I will take over!

2478
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Speed ​​out!

2479
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
It's crap in my mouth...

2480
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Now you don't have it...

2481
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Dear Joes!

2482
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Squeeze it, that life is also at my disposal...

2483
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I've lost so much...

2484
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
But the light shone.

2485
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
A purified, tainted arrow...

2486
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
That's what I lived for...

2487
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Waste, waste, waste!

2488
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
The blur breaks!

2489
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Waste, waste, waste

2490
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,000
To take everything

2491
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Set this heart on fire

2492
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Gained power

2493
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
This pain will ease

2494
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,000
If you think about it, you are me

2495
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:20,000
You've been both sides of the story

2496
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Child's Ice

2497
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Burning my body

2498
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Kill me

2499
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Kill me

2500
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Zettel told me

2501
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Using the sword as a medium, I will pour feathers into you.

2502
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Yay!

2503
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Defeated Diou

2504
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
That's not right.

2505
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Stupid Tomoka

2506
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
This is a sword

2507
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:54,000
緊弱緊弱

2508
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Don don don

2509
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:04,000
It's a little tense, but I can feel your pulse

2510
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Now you too can be part of my night

2511
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
thief

2512
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:17,000
What a monkey! You ran away from humans after all.

2513
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Why aren't you freezing me right now? Diou!

2514
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Just by being hit by this death, I have surpassed humanity

2515
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
You can't keep up

2516
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
You're a monkey, girl

2517
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,000
No! If there are people who die

2518
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,000
I'll search for that heart

2519
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Even humans grow

2520
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
As long as we are human

2521
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,000
If you wish for that, you can stop it

2522
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Like earth and ice

2523
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:58,000
I will sacrifice my life to prove my worth

2524
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Like earth and ice

2525
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Like earth and ice

2526
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Like earth and ice

2527
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Even the people I've connected with

2528
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Like earth and ice

2529
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:22,000
I will sacrifice my life to prove my worth

2530
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Diow! Diow! Diow!

2531
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:31,000
How many times have I come?

2532
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:34,000
I like Number One

2533
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
My eyes!

2534
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
It seems the original dream has entered his eyes.

2535
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Until I lose you

2536
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
I'm gonna hit you now

2537
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I won't stop

2538
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
That's stupid

2539
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
My body is hot

2540
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Melting

2541
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
be destroyed

2542
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
This Dio

2543
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
still

2544
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
There was more

2545
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
He broke his eye and released his own bodily fluids.

2546
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Dear Dio,

2547
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Mr.

2548
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Part

2549
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Part

2550
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
新聞!

2551
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000

73 people

2561
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
disappeared

2562
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
It suddenly disappeared overnight

2563
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
The groaning I heard from the deer

2564
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000

Men burning clothes

2571
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
And smashed it with a hammer

I wish you both happiness

I will always support you

2591
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000

This story will be shared by the world.

2602
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Continue speaking until uniformity is achieved

2603
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
That's this busybody

2604
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
It's a job introducing Speedwagon.

2605
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
But now

2606
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Speaking

this

2616
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:16,500
My hands are always touching yours

2617
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,000
What's wrong?

2618
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I'm happy you're here

2619
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:31,000
It's the same for me, I wanted you to meet your father.

2620
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,500
Let's go eat

2621
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:37,500

02:55:37,500 --> 02:55:38,500
That's...

2623
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:42,500
Erina, I'm back in the guest room.

2624
02:55:43,500 --> 02:55:45,000
Don't forget to lock the door

2625
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:02,500
I brought him with me.

2626

My Body

2627
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Are you here?

Dio

2629
02:56:10,500 --> 02:56:11,500
JoJo

2630
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
I dare to expose this pathetic state of myself to you

2631
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I used to underestimate you, but now I respect you

2632
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Because I realized that

2633
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,000
If God controls destiny

2634
02:56:32,500 --> 02:56:36,000
There's no relationship as calculated as ours

2635
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:41,500
I got this power because of you

2636
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Because you were there

2637
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:49,000
I don't have it all

2638
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:51,000
How far have you...

2639
02:56:52,500 --> 02:56:55,000
That's why this is destiny

2640
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I'm the only person in this world I respect, and I've got a human body.

2641
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Living a glorious eternity

2642
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
JoJo

2643
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
We are in this world

2644
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Two people are one

2645
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Lord Dio! Look! Look! Look! Please look!

2646
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:26,000
JoJo!

2647
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:32,000
From light to darkness, this is where my myth begins

2648
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Let's end it all and start it all

2649
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Don't destroy Dio's world, JoJo

2650
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Dio!

2651
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,000
There are keys that don't make any sound.

2652
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Only you can take a deep breath

2653
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:53,000
<i>My mythos begins here</i>

2654
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:58,000
The ship is in danger of slowing down.

2655
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Only this one!

2656
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:02,000
help me!

2657
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:03,000
help me!

2658
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Beat them to death?

2659
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Or do you enjoy being a knight?

2660
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:09,000
completely!

2661
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Don't give yourself, cut off your head

2662
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:19,000
My friend Yamagami-san will not tolerate insults.

2663
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:22,000
I'll steal you

2664
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:28,000
That blood will become my servant

2665
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Connecting to the future

2666
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:37,000
The last feather left

2667
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Just die.

2668
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Run!

2669
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Something inside me broke

2670
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Something decisive

2671
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
JoJo!

2672
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
This is it!

2673
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Run away

2674
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
No, JoJo

2675
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:16,000
With you

2676
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:19,000
Until it burns

2677
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:24,000
Everything is everything

2678
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Until it disappears

2679
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Flames run

2680
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Everything is connected

2681
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
Live for me

2682
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Everything is connected

2683
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,000
It's okay if you cry

2684
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:47,000
You will inherit this fate

2685
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:52,000
The flag of loneliness also grew

2686
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Be happy

2687
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
I'll live

2688
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Who will win in the end?

2689
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Dead Flower

2690
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Be happy

2691
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
I'll live

2692
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:15,000
JoJo!

2693
03:00:20,720 --> 03:00:21,720
It's about you

2694
03:00:23,780 --> 03:00:25,480
Before my consciousness melts

2695
03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:28,720
I thought you were coming.

2696
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:29,680
Let go

2697
03:00:30,680 --> 03:00:31,680
Let go, JoJo!

2698
03:00:39,080 --> 03:00:39,760
This guy

2699
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Dead

2700
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:11,800
It's about you

2701
03:01:13,800 --> 03:01:14,800
Before my consciousness melts

2702
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:16,800
I thought you were coming.

2703
03:01:17,800 --> 03:01:18,800
Let go, JoJo!

2704
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:24,800
His proud life

2705
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:28,800
Vanished beyond the customer

2706
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:33,800
The destiny and adventure

2707
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:38,800
It's undecided

2708
03:01:39,800 --> 03:01:41,800
Will continue to be spoken of forever

2709
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:46,800
Heart of Gold

2710
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,800
When I sing

2711
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:58,800
Two in One

2712
03:01:59,800 --> 03:02:01,800
A strange friendship

2713
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:03,800
feel

2714
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,800
I agree

2715
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:07,800
Yo

2716
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:10,800
Without you

2717
03:02:11,800 --> 03:02:13,800
Because you were there

2718
03:02:14,800 --> 03:02:15,800
Hey

2719
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:16,800
JoeJoe

2720
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:19,800
Now I

2721
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:24,800
Keep watching the stars

2722
03:02:25,800 --> 03:02:31,800
Guided by the destiny I love

2723
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:36,800
Reaching for the stars

2724
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:42,800
The two of us, our destiny

2725
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:44,800
Becoming One

2726
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:46,800
music

2727
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:48,800
Quietly

2728
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:50,800
From the world

2729
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:53,800
One saw the stars

2730
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:55,800
During the tour

2731
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:57,800
The stars shine

2732
03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:00,800
The mud pulsates

2733
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:03,800
One saw the mud

2734
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:05,800
Go away

2735
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:07,800
With you

2736
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:08,800
With you

2737
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:11,800
Light

2738
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:13,800
Lighting

2739
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:17,800
Let the wind blow tonight

2740
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:19,800
Everyone is shaking

2741
03:03:20,800 --> 03:03:21,800
In the darkness

2742
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:23,800
Ride the Shadows

2743
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:26,800
Transcend time

2744
03:03:27,800 --> 03:03:28,800
The world

2745
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:30,800
expensive

2746
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:32,800
Getting tired

2747
03:03:32,800 --> 03:03:38,800
Calling the Name of Time

2748
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:40,800
With you

2749
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:42,800
With you

2750
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:44,800
The stars

2751
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
The stars

2752
03:03:47,800 --> 03:03:49,800
shine

2753
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:52,800
mud

2754
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:54,800
teeth

2755
03:03:55,800 --> 03:03:56,800
Speedwagon is

2756
03:03:57,800 --> 03:03:58,800
Cool!

2757
03:03:58,800 --> 03:03:59,800
With you

2758
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:01,800
The stars shine

2759
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:04,800
I saw mud

2760
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:30,800
Lyrics, composition, arrangement, and arrangement

2761
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,800
【whale】

2762
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:18,000
I'm really happy that I've been able to gradually get involved in this way.

2763
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:22,000
So please take this opportunity to say a little thank you to your teacher.

2764
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Thank you so much, Dr. Araps, for gradually disrupting things.

2765
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:34,000
And thank you to my childhood friend Imamura.

2766
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
thank you.

2767
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Now, please, Mr. Koo.

2768
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:56,000
I had the opportunity to play Inspector Archer. My name is Yabatsu Kou.

2769
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:08,000
This is my first time performing in such a big musical, and musicals are the best.

2770
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:16,000
Is it possible to be this happy?

2771
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:28,000
This time in particular, I was able to do something that I personally will never be able to experience again.

2772
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:37,000
Well, I got to see everything that the staff were doing behind the scenes,

2773
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Even today, when I watched it, all sorts of things kept going round and round in my head, and I was constantly moved.

2774
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:53,000
This musical is really moving, isn't it?

2775
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Really.

2776
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
I'm so glad.

2777
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:11,000
To everyone here in the theater, to all the performers, to all the staff,

2778
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:13,000
I'm really grateful to all the staff.

2779
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:18,000
Thank you so much for supporting this reset, this moving fortress.

2780
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:30,000
And, especially for us, this time we were reminded once again that the greatest source of nourishment is the smiles of our customers, as seen here.

2781
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:34,000
It was a lecture that really made me feel that very strongly.

2782
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:42,000
I am truly happy that I was able to give such a miraculous lecture all the way to the end.

2783
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Thank you very much.

2784
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:54,000
【applause】

2785
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:58,000
Now, Mr. Kong, please. Thank you.

2786
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,000
Thank you very much.

2787
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Great staff, great cast.

2788
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:12,000
And thanks to everyone who came to the theater and everyone who watched the film,

2789
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:17,000
We have now made it through the viewing process and are now able to reach the final performance today.

2790
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:20,000
I am truly happy.

2791
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:24,000
And, best of all, he was very supportive.

2792
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
thank you.

2793
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:32,000
And, above all, my son was doing his best as a single man.

2794
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:35,000
【applause】

2795
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
That's amazing.

2796
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:40,000
Thank you very much.

2797
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
Thank you, Dad.

2798
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:46,000
The person who raised him wasn't wrong.

2799
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:48,000
I'm really happy.

2800
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:53,000
And then, thank you for your greeting earlier, Kouchi-san.

2801
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
They really supported this play.

2802
03:13:55,000 --> 03:13:59,000
Thank you very much. Thank you so very much.

2803
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:04,000
Everyone, please check out Kouchi's Proud Funding page.

2804
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,000
thank you.

2806
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:11,000
【applause】

2807
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:13,000
Now, we're all connected.

2808
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
We're connected.

2809
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
See you at the next theater.

2810
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,000
Thank you very much.

2811
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:23,000
【applause】

2812
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
Get rich.

2813
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
Get rich.

2814
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:28,000
[Laughter]

2815
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:30,000
Get rich.

2816
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
thank you.

2817
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:34,000
[Laughter]

2818
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
Now, Miisa-chan, please.

2819
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:37,000
yes.

2820
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:39,000
The hurdle has become even higher.

2821
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:40,000
[Laughter]

2822
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:43,000
I'm not sure if I can speak it well though.

2823
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:46,000
This is Shimizu Miisa, who plays Erina Pendle Ton.

2824
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:51,000
【applause】

2825
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:54,000
Thank you so much for joining us today.

2826
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:58,000
And thank you to everyone who watched the stream.

2827
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:01,000
What should I say?

2828
03:15:01,000 --> 03:15:08,000
It was really thanks to the strength of each cast member and the staff that we were able to get to this great war settlement.

2829
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
And this work.

2830
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:15,000
I think it's all thanks to everyone who supported me.

2831
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
Please come everyone

2832
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Please look at the stars

2833
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,000
That's it

2834
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
So, Dice, please

2835
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:47,000
yes

2836
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:50,000
Speed ​​Mode Role Dice

2837
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
Um

2838
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
It was my first experience

2839
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:01,000
It was really hard for me

2840
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:03,000
But really

2841
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:04,000
Yeah

2842
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
It was really hard though

2843
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:07,000
Already

2844
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
To get support

2845
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Like supporting them.

2846
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:13,000
Words like "support each other"

2847
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:16,000
It really feels like it's going straight into your body.

2848
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
It's a really nice spot

2849
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
Thanks to that

2850
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
I was able to get through it.

2851
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:23,000
in

2852
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:26,000
I can only say the best

2853
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
With everyone here on stage

2854
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
This person also said,

2855
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:31,000
I'm not standing on this stage

2856
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:33,000
Although he's not here today

2857
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:36,000
And all the staff who helped create it

2858
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:37,000
and

2859
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:40,000
For the past 5 months

2860
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
I really appreciate that we were able to be together.

2861
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,000
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

2862
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:46,000
Um

2863
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:48,000
Please love JoJo

2864
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

2865
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
Including everyone who loves me

2866
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,000
Thank you very much

2867
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Huh

2868
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
Ladies please

2869
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:10,000
I'm Toyama, and I supported the role of Cheppeli.

2870
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
Today

2871
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
Ceppeli

2872
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,000
Cheplisen

2873
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
Ceppeli

2874
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Nice to meet you again

2875
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:21,000
To everyone attending the Great Athletes' Music Performance and those watching the live stream,

2876
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Thank you very much

2877
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
If you really think back

2878
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,000
that

2879
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:31,000
There were a lot of different things that happened.

2880
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:32,000
Two people from JoJo

2881
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:35,000
Shotaro-kun and now Yuya-kun, who finished here yesterday

2882
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
And another Cheppeli

2883
03:17:37,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Hiro-kun

2884
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:39,000
And alone

2885
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:40,000
I've done this much

2886
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Led by Mamo-kun, this company is united as one.

2887
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:46,000
With the determination to make it a success

2888
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:49,000
This great player came here with the aim of becoming Rakugo.

2889
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:52,000
Yes, without calling anyone

2890
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:53,000
I've been able to come this far

2891
03:17:53,000 --> 03:17:56,000
Of course, the dedicated support of all the staff

2892
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:58,000
It is the result of your efforts.

2893
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:02,000
I only do half of each stage,

2894
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:05,000
Every single performance was met with thunderous applause.

2895
03:18:05,000 --> 03:18:06,000
5000 yen

2896
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:07,000
Um, us

2897
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:08,000
The cast now is

2898
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:11,000
It's really the energy of your ripples.

2899
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:13,000
How much courage it gave us

2900
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:16,000
I think we all really feel that way.

2901
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:17,000
That's really true now.

2902
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:20,000
I was there for almost six months, almost five months.

2903
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:23,000
It really is like a family

2904
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:26,000
It's already today and tomorrow will be a valley

2905
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
Hey hey

2906
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:29,000
valley?

2907
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
It's a sweet story

2908
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
Well, let's just leave it as a casual acquaintance.

2909
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
Just a little bit

2910
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
I feel a little lonely though

2911
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:41,000
The world of JoJo that I really love

2912
03:18:41,000 --> 03:18:44,000
And with my favorite members

2913
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:49,000
I found a group of people who breathed the same air as me at the theater.

2914
03:18:49,000 --> 03:18:50,000
Your hearts

2915
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:53,000
Bang, that was it.

2916
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:58,000
It has become my treasure

2917
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

2918
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:01,000
Thank you very much everyone

2919
03:19:01,000 --> 03:19:03,000
thank you

2920
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
I want to finish again

2921
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:07,000
Blacks

2922
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,000
Teacher, please

2923
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:16,000
good job

2924
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
I'm Tetsuya Bessho, who co-starred with Joestar.

2925
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
Thank you for today

2926
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:28,000
I am overwhelmed with emotion

2927
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:33,000
I have been involved in a lot of different works.

2928
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:37,000
This work is exactly as the title suggests.

2929
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:40,000
It was a strange adventure.

2930
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:41,000
hey

2931
03:19:41,000 --> 03:19:43,000
Really

2932
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:45,000
As some of you may know,

2933
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:48,000
Born at the Imperial Theatre at the opening of Haran

2934
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:52,000
The current Imperial Theatre is closing.

2935
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:55,000
It will be the last new work

2936
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:59,000
I participated without tears.

2937
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:01,000
My friends are cast members here.

2938
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
It is staff

2939
03:20:03,000 --> 03:20:05,000
And the original author

2940
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:08,000
The collectors and the people of the East

2941
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
It took five years

2942
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:22,000
Apparently the script was rewritten 17 times. This work was born out of this process, and has now been well received by everyone, and is now coming to an end.

2943
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:32,240
There are many musicals, including works from overseas, and such works, such as Coordinate Zero, are on Broadway or in the West End, and we are here in Japan,

2944
03:20:32,240 --> 03:20:48,240
We will be screening the film for a thousand days and ten thousand days, amplifying it greatly and in a very Japanese style, but I believe that what you have seen this time is a work that has become a coordinate axis, going from zero to one.

2945
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:58,240
This work may be taken over and performed again someday, but I hope that my colleagues here at Zero One on this coordinate axis will

2946
03:20:58,240 --> 03:21:05,240
I really love them all and feel like they are all my sons and daughters.

2947
03:21:08,240 --> 03:21:25,240
There was only one difference. We both have the same father, and as a father, I would like to continue to tenaciously survive in the musical world as a friend who drinks mud and stars together, both pure and murky.

2948
03:21:29,240 --> 03:21:42,240
I am so grateful to have two wonderful sons like this, and today, you may be watching me somewhere, but my son is also Yuyaku.

2949
03:21:42,240 --> 03:21:46,240
I was able to take part in a truly wonderful production as a father.

2950
03:21:46,240 --> 03:21:58,240
If you have any worries, I hope you will just think that in the end, everything is connected within you, and that everything has meaning.

2951
03:21:58,240 --> 03:22:06,240
I hope this work will make you think that there is surely light and stars beyond. Thank you very much.

2952
03:22:06,240 --> 03:22:14,240
【applause】

2953
03:22:14,240 --> 03:22:17,240
Now, Mambo, please.

2954
03:22:17,240 --> 03:22:26,240
【applause】

2955
03:22:26,240 --> 03:22:30,240
I don't know where to start, really.

2956
03:22:30,240 --> 03:22:41,240
But anyway, I'm glad I met you. Really.

2957
03:22:41,240 --> 03:22:53,240
【applause】

2958
03:22:54,240 --> 03:23:04,240
We try to provide entertainment, but sometimes it's tough.

2959
03:23:04,240 --> 03:23:12,240
Well, it's scary sometimes.

2960
03:23:12,240 --> 03:23:22,240
But, as Dice said earlier, it's not just about supporting each other in the literal sense,

2961
03:23:22,240 --> 03:23:33,240
This company made me realize that this is what it means to truly support one another.

2962
03:23:33,240 --> 03:23:44,240
Of course, there were a lot of things that happened.

2963
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:55,240
Those are the only words I can express right now, but I want to express more than that.

2964
03:23:55,240 --> 03:24:08,240
I was able to hold it as a treasure, and more than anything, I was able to share it with so many people.

2965
03:24:08,240 --> 03:24:12,240
[Laughter]

2966
03:24:12,240 --> 03:24:17,240
【applause】

2967
03:24:17,240 --> 03:24:22,240
Having people enjoy themselves is what makes us happiest.

2968
03:24:22,240 --> 03:24:31,240
I am happy to have been able to experience this with these members.

2969
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:39,240
Jojo's brother passed away last week, but as his father said just now,

2970
03:24:39,240 --> 03:24:49,240
I think we will continue to look forward and pursue various forms of expression in our own individual ways.

2971
03:24:49,240 --> 03:24:54,240
It's still going to be useful.

2972
03:24:54,240 --> 03:24:56,240
[Laughter]

2973
03:24:56,240 --> 03:25:03,240
【applause】

2974
03:25:03,240 --> 03:25:05,240
We'll definitely meet again.

2975
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:09,240
And I think it would be great to see them again in this JoJo.

2976
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:18,000
It's all connected

2977
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:24,000
I too dream of such a day, and today I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.

2978
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:26,000
Thank you everyone

2979
03:25:35,000 --> 03:25:38,000
I'm going to say something really nice.

2980
03:25:41,000 --> 03:25:47,000
I think it will tighten up nicely.

2981
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,000
thank you

2982
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:53,000
I'm Seitaro Arisa, the person who investigated Jonah.

2983
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:03,000
I don't know if you all really noticed,

2984
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Because this is the kind of person I am

2985
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:11,000
Even if I stand in the middle, everyone

2986
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:15,000
A lot of people really supported me.

2987
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:18,000
He was like a warm older brother to me.

2988
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:20,000
People who are like family

2989
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:23,000
That's fine for you, so just be yourself

2990
03:26:23,000 --> 03:26:27,000
Those words alone have really brought me this far

2991
03:26:27,000 --> 03:26:31,000
However, when I look around me,

2992
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
This time everyone

2993
03:26:35,000 --> 03:26:39,000
I've seen the faces that look like they're in pain

2994
03:26:39,000 --> 03:26:41,000
Really everyone

2995
03:26:41,000 --> 03:26:43,000
The curtain won't open

2996
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:47,000
I think I may have caused a lot of anxiety.

2997
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:50,000
That voice is reaching me directly, too.

2998
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:54,000
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

2999
03:26:54,000 --> 03:27:00,000
I received a lot of messages asking me what was going on.

3000
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,000
But I

3001
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,000
I really believe in everyone

3002
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:10,000
I've already seen everyone working hard here.

3003
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:14,000
I feel like I should just watch it.

3004
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,000
Just please wait for me

3005
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:21,000
That's really the only feeling I have.

3006
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:25,000
We've all overcome so many big obstacles together

3007
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,000
Even if we don't have any more conversations

3008
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:30,000
It's an invisible bond

3009
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:34,000
It's like we're becoming more and more connected through these things.

3010
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:36,000
I've been feeling it ever since the rehearsal studio.

3011
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:39,000
After all, open the curtain like this

3012
03:27:40,000 --> 03:27:43,000
The other Yuya who plays Jonathan Josser

3013
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:48,000
We've really talked about a lot of things up until today.

3014
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:52,000
Yesterday I was watching Yuya's War Village and Hiro's War Village.

3015
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:54,000
After all,

3016
03:27:55,000 --> 03:27:56,000
It was there today

3017
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:57,000
One more

3018
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:02,000
I felt like I had really completed it.

3019
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:05,000
I've seen some really amazing things

3020
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:08,000
I'm glad I worked hard after all.

3021
03:28:09,000 --> 03:28:10,000
I really felt that way as of yesterday.

3022
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:13,000
Today, everyone was so

3023
03:28:14,000 --> 03:28:15,000
Seeing your happy face

3024
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:20,000
I am truly filled with joy from my heart

3025
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:22,000
As I had originally thought,

3026
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:24,000
I think I was able to witness a historic moment.

3027
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:26,000
World Garden

3028
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
We all really worked hard to create this

3029
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:31,000
already

3030
03:28:31,000 --> 03:28:33,000
Well, starting with Koishi-san

3031
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,000
Koishi-san raised the flag and we all felt like we should follow him.

3032
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:39,000
I'm trying my best to climb the hill, climb, climb

3033
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:44,000
I think I was able to really make everyone happy today.

3034
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,000
Thank you so much

3035
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:57,000
I also spoke without really thinking about it.

3036
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:02,000
Maybe some of you think that's not the case.

3037
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:06,000
This is definitely my feeling

3038
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:08,000
The company's feelings

3039
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:12,000
I may be overconfident today, but

3040
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:15,000
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3041
03:29:22,000 --> 03:29:29,000
It's okay to think that

3042
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:41,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also provided support here.

3043
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:48,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also supported them.

3044
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Everyone did their best.

3045
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:01,000
Yuya

3046
03:30:02,000 --> 03:30:03,000
Iro-san

3047
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:05,000
thank you

3048
03:30:10,000 --> 03:30:18,740
【applause】

3049
03:30:18,740 --> 03:30:21,640
I used this to cut the river.

3050
03:30:21,640 --> 03:30:22,980
[Laughter]

3051
03:30:22,980 --> 03:30:29,680
Also, in front of everyone

3052
03:30:29,680 --> 03:30:33,080
So that we can meet as JoJo

3053
03:30:33,080 --> 03:30:37,880
And in the future, this work will not only be limited to Japan

3054
03:30:37,880 --> 03:30:39,880
I wish I could stay in the world

3055
03:30:39,880 --> 03:30:43,880
[Laughter]

3056
03:30:43,880 --> 03:30:45,880
Embracing big dreams

3057
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:47,880
I would like to close today

3058
03:30:47,880 --> 03:30:48,880
[Laughter]

3059
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:50,880
Thank you very much

3060
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:56,880
【applause】

3061
03:30:56,880 --> 03:30:58,880
Well, I hope to see you again

3062
03:30:58,880 --> 03:31:00,880
Today is truly a day

3063
03:31:00,880 --> 03:31:02,880
thank you

3064
03:31:02,880 --> 03:31:05,880

Everyone...I said everyone.

3118
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000
They're not friends.

3119
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:53,000
Mina...Mina-chan.

3120
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:54,000
Not everyone.

3121
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:58,000
Thank you everyone!

3122
03:36:03,000 --> 03:36:05,000
We'll definitely see each other again!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Sorry sorry.

3127
03:36:21,000 --> 03:36:22,000
be careful!

3128
03:36:37,000 --> 03:36:39,000
I'm sorry.
