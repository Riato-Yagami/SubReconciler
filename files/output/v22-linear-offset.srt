I think my leg may have hit him!
{\ O (rank)}

305
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,175
Danny is the Joestar household’s
wonderful guard dog.
{\ O (rank)}

306
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.
{\ O (rank)}

307
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
JoJo!
{\ O (rank)}

308
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
You’ll let this Danny matter go, right?
{\ O (spread)}

309
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
Yes, sir.
{\ O (rank)}

310
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
Good.
{\ O (spread)}

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes!
{\ O (spread)}

312
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!
{\ O (spread)}

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Make sure to get along with each other.
{\ O (spread)}

314
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, allow me to show you to your room.
{\ O (spread)}

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mister Brando!
{\ O (spread)}

316
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:21,679
Nice to have met you!
{\ O (spread)}

317
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,420
Ta-ta, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

318
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,183
Now then, let me get—
{\ O (spread)}

319
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:40,947
Watch it!
{\ O (spread)}

320
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:41,710
Don’t touch my bag!
{\ O (spread)}

321
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,474
I was just trying to carry it for—
{\ O (rank)}

322
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:43,238
That’s enough.
{\ O (rank)}

323
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:44,001
Your hand is covered in dog drool.
{\ O (rank)}

324
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:44,765
Pardon me if I don’t want
it all over my things!
{\ O (rank)}

325
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:45,529
Alright JoJo, I’ll tell
you from the get-go.
{\ O (spread)}

326
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:46,292
I like being the best!
I’m always number one!
{\ O (spread)}

327
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,056
I don’t care who you are,
no one looks down on me!
{\ O (spread)}

328
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was only trying to be friendly!
{\ O (spread)}

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you two doing?
{\ O (rank)}

330
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ O (spread)}

331
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I hate dogs.
{\ O (spread)}

332
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:10,919
The way they grovel and suck
up to humans disgusts me.
{\ O (spread)}

333
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:19,719
Keep your stupid dog away from me!
{\ O (spread)}

334
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:28,520
Coming, Lord Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

335
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Thus, with this meeting, the
two boys’ youth had begun.
{\ O (spread)}

336
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Are you coming, JoJo, Dio?
{\ O (spread)}

337
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,495
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (rank)}

338
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,870
<i>We take on the duty of
becoming true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread)}

339
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,245
<i>This is why we study, acquire knowledge,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

340
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,620
{\an8}<i>(Without pause!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

341
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,995
{\an8}<i>(Without limit!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

342
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,370
<i>And arm ourselves with logic!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

343
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,745
{\an8}<i>(So you’ll never lose!)</i>
{\ O (rank)}

344
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (spread)}

345
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,919
<i>For the sake of heading
the house of Joestar</i>
{\ O (spread)}

346
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,719
{\an8}<i>(The honourable Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

347
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,520
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

348
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,320
<i>The same mistakes once again</i>
{\ O (spread)}

349
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>How many times have
you made them! Six times!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

350
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,120
<i>Dio has all of them correct!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

351
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:46,120
It’s just because I love reading so much!
{\ O (spread)}

352
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:54,120
But they haven’t even
taught us this in school yet!
{\ O (spread)}

353
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:02,120
<i>Bear in mind, as proud nobles,</i>
{\ O (rank)}

354
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:10,120
<i>We behave like true gentlemen</i>
{\ O (spread)}

355
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Sit up straight, use your knife with grace,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

356
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ O (spread)}

357
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,620
<i>For the sake of being loved as a Joestar!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

358
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:26,120
{\an8}<i>(So elegantly!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

359
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,120
{\an8}<i>(The proud Joestars!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

360
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,620
<i>What’s this, JoJo? JoJo!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

361
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,120
<i>Do you call yourself a gentleman?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

362
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,620
<i>Look at Dio’s elegant touch</i>
{\ O (spread)}

363
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
{\an8}<i>(So gracefully!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

364
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:16,119
<i>So that your mouth always remains spotless</i>
{\ O (spread)}

365
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:16,119
{\an8}<i>(Unfailingly!)</i>
{\ O (spread)}

366
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,120
<i>His manners are perfect!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

367
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,620
<i>Take away JoJo’s plates!
You will go without dinner tonight!</i>
{\ O (gap)}

368
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
<i>Observe and follow Dio’s example</i>
{\ O (rank)}

369
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,295
<i>I am embarrassed by
how much I’ve spoiled you</i>
{\ O (rank)}

370
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:57,472
But...
{\ O (spread)}

371
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:02,648
My mother taught me well. She
always made sure I sat up straight.
{\ O (rank)}

372
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:07,824
<i>Bear in mind, as honourable nobles,</i>
{\ O (gap)}

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
<i>In our hearts we must always consider
questions of philosophy and justice</i>
{\ O (gap)}

374
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In our great England, a tale of two knights
has been passed down for generations.
{\ O (rank)}

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.
{\ O (spread)}

376
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ O (spread)}

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
And so she gave them this condition:
{\ O (rank)}

378
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ O (rank)}

379
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here is my question for you:
{\ O (spread)}

380
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!
{\ O (spread)}

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ O (spread)}

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,666
What was the first thing they
saw through their prison bars?
{\ O (rank)}

383
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,333
Was it the mud that lay before their eyes?
{\ O (spread)}

384
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ O (rank)}

385
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ O (spread)}

386
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,750
The stars?
{\ O (spread)}

387
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:33,500
Or the mud?
{\ O (rank)}

388
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:41,250
I...
{\ O (spread)}

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ O (spread)}

390
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can’t achieve anything if you’re dead.
{\ O (spread)}

391
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So no matter what tricks
they would have had to pull,
{\ O (spread)}

392
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I think they were looking at the mud.
{\ O (rank)}

393
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:33,999
What’s your reasoning?
{\ O (spread)}

394
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ O (spread)}

395
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I think...
{\ O (spread)}

396
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

397
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,529
They held onto their honour!
{\ O (spread)}

398
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:26,058
The names of those two knights
will be etched into history!
{\ O (spread)}

399
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:26,588
So what!
{\ O (spread)}

400
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:27,117
So what?
{\ O (spread)}

401
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:27,647
The way one lives, and the things
one does, those are important!
{\ O (spread)}

402
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:28,176
But they—
{\ O (spread)}

403
00:27:28,176 --> 00:27:28,705
They were left empty-handed
in the end!
{\ O (spread)}

404
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:29,235
Such regret...
{\ O (spread)}

405
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:29,764
Such powerlessness...
{\ O (spread)}

406
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:30,294
What they saw was the mud!
{\ O (rank)}

407
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:30,823
Their lesson is to teach us what
we can achieve by staying alive!
{\ O (spread)}

408
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,352
They held onto their
pride until the very end!
{\ O (spread)}

409
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:31,882
They were looking at the stars! I think
they’re teaching us <i>how</i> we should live!
{\ O (spread)}

410
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:32,411
Listen!
{\ O (spread)}

411
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:32,941
You’re a noble! You have it all!
{\ O (spread)}

412
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:33,470
You’ve lived by taking
from those beneath you!
{\ O (spread)}

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ O (spread)}

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,320
I—
{\ O (spread)}

415
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,640
That’s enough, you two.
{\ O (spread)}

416
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,960
There’s no right answer to this question.
{\ O (spread)}

417
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,280
Bear in mind—
{\ O (spread)}

418
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,600
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread)}

419
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,920
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

420
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,240
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

421
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,560
<i>Either one could be said to be correct</i>
{\ O (spread)}

422
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,880
<i>A world without disparity, that’s sports</i>
{\ O (spread)}

423
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,200
<i>Where courage alone
has the chance to overturn</i>
{\ O (spread)}

424
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,520
<i>Get ready to rumble! Fanaticism
overcomes all differences</i>
{\ O (spread)}

425
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,840
<i>This is straight up religion!
If you lose, instant fucking funeral!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

426
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,160
<i>All eyes on are on this ritual
where triumph goes to the victor</i>
{\ O (spread)}

427
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,480
<i>Everyone, gather around!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

428
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,800
<i>The winner is a sweeping hero</i>
{\ O (spread)}

429
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,120
<i>Who will be declared king?!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

430
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,440
<i>The opening bell rings</i>
{\ O (spread)}

431
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,760
<i>Here comes today’s challenger!</i>
{\ O (rank)}

432
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,080
Oi!
{\ O (spread)}

433
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,400
Hey hey, JoJo JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

434
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,720
Right in the face! The winner is Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

435
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,040
Our new champion!
{\ O (spread)}

436
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,360
You did it, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

437
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,680
Danny would be proud!
{\ O (spread)}

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?
{\ O (spread)}

439
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,833
Is there anyone?
{\ O (spread)}

440
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,666
Everyone listen up!
{\ O (spread)}

441
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:39,500
A new face has just asked to join our game.
{\ O (spread)}

442
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,333
His name is Dio Brando!
{\ O (spread)}

443
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,166
Dio Brando?
{\ O (spread)}

444
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,000
-Shall we tell our new friend
how we do things here?
{\ O (spread)}

445
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,833
Yeah! Do it!
{\ O (spread)}

446
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,666
Alright, let’s do it!
{\ O (spread)}

447
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,500
-Good!
{\ O (spread)}

448
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,333
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—
{\ O (spread)}

449
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,166
Don’t worry, I played by the
 same rules back in London.
{\ O (spread)}

450
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,000
That’s the bell!
{\ O (spread)}

451
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,833
-Go, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

452
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,666
Beat him up!
{\ O (spread)}

453
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:13,500
What is this move!
{\ O (spread)}

454
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,333
I’ve never seen it before!
{\ O (spread)}

455
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,166
Oi, JoJo!

We bought it from a London art dealer,

On the way back,

JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?
{\ O (spread)}

498
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It’s because of the trust and
friendship Danny has in JoJo.

Friendship? With a dog?
{\ O (spread)}

I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.
{\ O (spread)}

501

At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,

And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.

A figure, hearing his screams,
flew down to the river.

It was Danny!

He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.
{\ O (gap)}

509
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Danny was brave to have risked
his own life to save another.
{\ O (rank)}

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Young JoJo was moved by Danny’s bravery.

“Fear” sends your breathing awry!

You ought to use it to

Mary Stuart!

{\ O (spread)}

We listened to it together, didn’t we?!

JoJo, Dio!
{\ O (spread)}

This is a story of knightly pride!
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Long ago, 300 years before today</i>

<i>And the other, the beautiful Mary Stuart</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:25:42,742 --> 02:25:47,178
<i>Two legendary heroes came forward,</i>

<i>Offering up their swords to serve Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Tarkus’s strength cleaved

{\ O (spread)}

2056
02:25:56,049 --> 02:26:00,485
<i>Bruford, with his skill and spirit,
cut down foes like a phantom</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2057
02:26:00,485 --> 02:26:04,920
<i>Without any family, the

{\ O (spread)}

2058
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:09,356
<i>While wishing for a nest to rest in</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:26:09,356 --> 02:26:13,792
<i>After finding peace in Mary’s affections,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:26:13,792 --> 02:26:18,227
<i>They swore their loyalty to her</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2061
02:26:18,227 --> 02:26:22,663
But one day, Elizabeth
accused their master, Mary,
{\ O (spread)}

2062
02:26:22,663 --> 02:26:27,099
Of murdering her husband,
and she was captured.
{\ O (spread)}

2063

<i>The two heroes would not rest</i>

<i>When it came to saving their Mary</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2065
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:40,406
<i>In order to stop those two heroes,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2066
02:26:40,406 --> 02:26:44,841
<i>Elizabeth made an appeal:</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2067
02:26:44,841 --> 02:26:49,277
<i>“You two, surrender at once!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2068
02:26:49,277 --> 02:26:53,713
<i>“And I will spare your master’s life!”</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2069
02:26:53,713 --> 02:26:58,148
<i>This, we cannot refuse</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2070
02:26:58,148 --> 02:27:02,584
<i>In this, we hold no regrets</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2071
02:27:02,584 --> 02:27:07,020
<i>For our queen is our life!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2072
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:11,455
But in the moment they
were to be executed—
{\ O (spread)}

2073
02:27:11,455 --> 02:27:15,891
I’ll give you a little souvenir
before your trip to Hell!
{\ O (spread)}

2074
02:27:15,891 --> 02:27:20,326
Your master isn’t being held in the tower.
{\ O (spread)}

2075
02:27:20,326 --> 02:27:24,762
I cut off her head myself just yesterday!
{\ O (spread)}

2076
02:27:24,762 --> 02:27:29,198
Look at her lying over

{\ O (spread)}

2077
02:27:29,198 --> 02:27:33,633
After all, if she was left alive,
we’d risk a rebellion!
{\ O (spread)}

2078
02:27:33,633 --> 02:27:38,069
<i>You’ve betrayed us, Elizabeth</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>We curse you with our grudge!</i>

<i>We curse you for all eternity!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2081
02:27:46,940 --> 02:27:51,376
<i>Stiff with rage, Tarkus’s

{\ O (spread)}

02:27:51,376 --> 02:27:55,812
<i>They couldn’t cut through his neck!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2083
02:27:55,812 --> 02:28:00,247
<i>Bruford, filled with regret,
ensnared them with his hair</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2084
02:28:00,247 --> 02:28:04,683
<i>As though it were alive!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2085
02:28:04,683 --> 02:28:09,119
<i>And that is the story,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2086
02:28:09,119 --> 02:28:13,554
<i>Of those knights who lived
according to their hearts</i>
{\ O (spread)}

<i>Until the very end!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2088
02:28:17,990 --> 02:28:22,426
Such blind devotion—
it gives me goosebumps!
{\ O (spread)}

2089
02:28:22,426 --> 02:28:26,861
Oh, what loyal hearts!
{\ O (spread)}

2090
02:28:26,861 --> 02:28:31,297
But those two should
have done a better job!
{\ O (spread)}

2091
02:28:31,297 --> 02:28:35,733
In the end, they couldn’t do
anything from down in the mud.
{\ O (spread)}

2092
02:28:35,733 --> 02:28:40,168
The only thing to call
their deaths is useless!
{\ O (spread)}

2093
02:28:40,168 --> 02:28:44,604
It might be as you say, however—
{\ O (spread)}

2094
02:28:44,604 --> 02:28:49,039
There is nothing that is without meaning.
{\ O (spread)}

2095
02:28:49,039 --> 02:28:53,475
The same can be said about the
fact that you came here to this house.
{\ O (spread)}

2096
02:28:53,475 --> 02:28:57,911
Everything is connected!
{\ O (spread)}

2097
02:28:57,911 --> 02:29:02,346
I want to believe that they
kept on looking at the stars!
{\ O (spread)}

2098
02:29:02,346 --> 02:29:06,782
<i>All people live in a prison called fate</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2099
02:29:06,782 --> 02:29:11,218
<i>Reaching out through those bars,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2100
02:29:11,218 --> 02:29:15,653
<i>Do they see the stars? Or the mud?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2101
02:29:15,653 --> 02:29:20,089
<i>Either one—</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2102
02:29:20,089 --> 02:29:24,525
<i>JoJo</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2103

<i>Dio</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2104
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,396
<i>Could be said to be correct!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2105
02:29:33,396 --> 02:29:37,832
I turned those two
{\ O (spread)}

2106
02:29:37,832 --> 02:29:42,267
Into vengeful revenants that
would send even the devil running!
{\ O (spread)}

2107
02:29:42,267 --> 02:29:46,703
Even history bends before me!
{\ O (spread)}

2108
02:29:46,703 --> 02:29:51,139
It can’t be!
{\ O (spread)}

2109
02:29:51,139 --> 02:29:55,574
Such grotesque forms!
{\ O (spread)}

2110
02:29:55,574 --> 02:30:00,010
It’s the perfect form for
taking their revenge!
{\ O (rank)}

2111
02:30:00,010 --> 02:30:04,446
Don’t you think so?
{\ O (spread)}

2112
02:30:04,446 --> 02:30:08,881
Kill them all!
{\ O (spread)}

2113
02:30:08,881 --> 02:30:13,317
Continue from where
you left off on that day!
{\ O (rank)}

2114
02:30:13,317 --> 02:30:17,753
Tarkus!
{\ O (spread)}

2115
02:30:17,753 --> 02:30:22,188
Bruford!
{\ O (spread)}

2116
02:30:22,188 --> 02:30:26,624
Play me a fanfare with their screams!
{\ O (spread)}

2117
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
Our grudge!
{\ O (spread)}

2118
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:34,393
Our pride!
{\ O (spread)}

2119
02:30:34,393 --> 02:30:35,726
Great Dark Knight Bruford!
{\ O (spread)}

2120
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:39,060
And you, Tarkus!
{\ O (rank)}

2121
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:42,202
The way you feel—
{\ O (spread)}

2122
02:30:42,202 --> 02:30:45,345
Your pride, your resentment.
{\ O (rank)}

2123
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
Tarkus!
{\ O (spread)}

2124
02:30:45,345 --> 02:30:48,488
I can’t even imagine it!
{\ O (spread)}

2125
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:52,277
I won’t let you interfere!
{\ O (spread)}

2126
02:30:48,488 --> 02:30:51,631
But I also bear my own burdens!
{\ O (spread)}

2127
02:30:51,631 --> 02:30:54,774
I’m gonna be the one to eat ‘em!
{\ O (spread)}

2128
02:30:52,277 --> 02:30:57,494
<i>A wedge driven into the
wasteland of my memory</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2129
02:30:54,774 --> 02:30:57,917
I’ll savour every bit of his cartilage!
{\ O (spread)}

2130
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
My master—I, Bruford,
{\ O (spread)}

2131
02:30:57,494 --> 02:31:02,712
<i>At dawn, a blood-red sun
rose over the Atlantic Ocean</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2132
02:30:59,060 --> 02:30:45,059
Would like to be the one to bring
an end to this brave man’s life!
{\ O (spread)}

2133
02:30:59,061 --> 02:30:45,059
Alright, go ahead!
{\ O (spread)}

2134
02:30:59,063 --> 02:30:45,059
We’ll duel as knights!
{\ O (spread)}

2135
02:30:59,064 --> 02:30:45,059
Run away, you two!
{\ O (spread)}

2136
02:30:59,066 --> 02:30:45,059
Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

2137
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:03,060
That man’s pride...
{\ O (spread)}

2138
02:31:02,712 --> 02:31:07,929
Old man!
{\ O (spread)}

2139
02:31:03,060 --> 02:30:57,059
I will stand to meet it, as a knight!
{\ O (rank)}

2140
02:31:07,929 --> 02:31:13,146
Don’t come any closer!
{\ O (spread)}

2141
02:31:13,146 --> 02:31:18,364
Damn it...
{\ O (spread)}

2142
02:31:18,364 --> 02:31:23,581
Fucking hell!
{\ O (spread)}

2143
02:31:23,581 --> 02:31:28,799
<i>There’s nothing I can do,
I’m a mere spectator</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2144
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:34,016
<i>I’ve got nothing, I’m powerless</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2145
02:31:34,016 --> 02:31:39,233
<i>Come on, get real,
even at a time like this?</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2146
02:31:39,233 --> 02:31:44,451
<i>Even if I give up, the pain
will just be for another day</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2147
02:31:44,451 --> 02:31:49,668
<i>And tomorrow, yes tomorrow,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2148
02:31:49,668 --> 02:31:54,886
<i>I’ll still be over here crying like a loser</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2149
02:31:54,886 --> 02:32:00,103
Honourable knight,
{\ O (spread)}

2150
02:32:00,103 --> 02:32:05,320
Is revenge your answer?
{\ O (spread)}

2151
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:10,538
Is that what you take pride in?
{\ O (rank)}

2152
02:32:10,538 --> 02:32:15,755
If you want to preach, then fight
with your pride on the line!
{\ O (spread)}

2153
02:32:15,755 --> 02:32:20,973
You can lecture me after you win!
{\ O (spread)}

2154
02:32:20,973 --> 02:32:26,190
<i>Now’s the time, to let
courage resonate in my heart</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2155
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:31,407
<i>I’m not scared of pain</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2156
02:32:31,407 --> 02:32:36,625
<i>I must find the strength to stand up</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2157
02:32:36,625 --> 02:32:41,842
<i>Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2158
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
<i>Tomorrow is right now!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2159
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:52,660
Old man!
{\ O (spread)}

2160
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:56,260
Melt!
{\ O (spread)}

2161
02:32:56,260 --> 02:32:59,859
I didn’t follow you to
become a hindrance!
{\ O (rank)}

2162
02:32:59,859 --> 02:33:03,460
Speedwagon...
{\ O (spread)}

2163
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:07,060
<i>I’ll let courage resonate in my heart</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2164
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:10,660
<i>And look the enemy in the eyes</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2165
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:14,260
<i>Won’t wait for a distant tomorrow</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2166
02:33:14,260 --> 02:33:17,859
<i>I’ll start walking,</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2167
02:33:17,859 --> 02:33:21,460
<i>Find the strength to
get back on my feet</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2168
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,060
<i>Tomorrow is now!</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2169
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:34,696
JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

2170
02:33:34,696 --> 02:33:42,332
Cut finely, beat of my blood!
{\ O (spread)}

2171
02:33:42,332 --> 02:33:49,969
Please... This knight’s proud heart,
{\ O (spread)}

2172
02:33:49,969 --> 02:33:57,605
Let it somehow be restored!
{\ O (rank)}

2173
02:33:57,605 --> 02:34:05,241
I am the Dark Knight Bruford!
{\ O (rank)}

2174
02:34:05,241 --> 02:34:12,878
This pain means nothing to me!
{\ O (spread)}

2175
02:34:12,878 --> 02:34:20,514
Why aren’t you moving?
{\ O (rank)}

2176
02:34:20,514 --> 02:34:28,150
Just now,
{\ O (rank)}

2177
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:35,787
You said “pain”.
{\ O (rank)}

2178
02:34:35,787 --> 02:34:43,423
That means that now,
{\ O (rank)}

2179
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
Pain?
{\ O (rank)}

2180
02:34:41,060 --> 02:34:50,529
That’s why...
{\ O (spread)}

2181
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You can feel pain!
{\ O (rank)}

2182
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
Pain...
{\ O (rank)}

2183
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I stopped fighting you.
{\ O (rank)}

2184
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That’s why you stopped your sword.
{\ O (rank)}

2185
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a great knight.
{\ O (spread)}

2186
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,000
You are human!
{\ O (rank)}

2187
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Is proof of life!
{\ O (spread)}

2188
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,500
So this is what it means to be human?
{\ O (spread)}

2189
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Because of this pain, I can also feel
the joy of being alive in this moment.
{\ O (spread)}

2190
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I feel a bizarre sense of peace now.
{\ O (spread)}

2191
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Bruford...
{\ O (spread)}

2192
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I dedicate to you the word
engraved in my sword.
{\ O (spread)}

2193
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Luck!
{\ O (spread)}

2194
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:10,083
And also...
{\ O (spread)}

2195
02:36:10,083 --> 02:36:15,166
Pluck!
{\ O (spread)}

2196
02:36:15,166 --> 02:36:20,250
To think, I had to kill him
in order to save his soul...
{\ O (spread)}

2197
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:25,333
Damn you!
{\ O (spread)}

2198
02:36:25,333 --> 02:36:30,416
JoJo!
{\ O (rank)}

2199
02:36:30,416 --> 02:36:35,500
I can’t believe you actually
defeated the Dark Knight!
{\ O (spread)}

2200
02:36:35,500 --> 02:36:40,583
Just as I thought...
{\ O (spread)}

2201
02:36:40,583 --> 02:36:45,666
I, Dio, will—
{\ O (spread)}

2202
02:36:45,666 --> 02:36:50,750
Hey baby!
{\ O (spread)}

2203
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:55,833
I bet the blow from that
ripple-charged flower must hurt!
{\ O (spread)}

2204
02:36:55,833 --> 02:37:00,916
What the...
{\ O (spread)}

2205
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Your ripple is more vulgar than frog piss!
{\ O (spread)}

2206
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:14,571
Watch out, Mr. Joestar!
{\ O (spread)}

2207
02:37:14,571 --> 02:37:20,142
What an embarrassment of a knight!
{\ O (spread)}

2208
02:37:20,142 --> 02:37:25,714
He never got his revenge!
{\ O (spread)}

2209
02:37:25,714 --> 02:37:31,285
What did he have to be joyful about!
{\ O (spread)}

2210
02:37:31,285 --> 02:37:36,857
JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

2211
02:37:36,857 --> 02:37:42,428
No!
{\ O (spread)}

2212
02:37:42,428 --> 02:37:48,000
How could you!
{\ O (spread)}

2213
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,571
For victory!
{\ O (spread)}

2214
02:37:53,571 --> 02:37:59,142
I take pride in victory!
{\ O (spread)}

2215
02:37:59,142 --> 02:38:04,714
Fuck!
{\ O (spread)}

2216
02:38:04,714 --> 02:38:10,285
I’ll get you!
{\ O (spread)}

2217
02:38:10,285 --> 02:38:15,857
I’ll get you for this!
{\ O (spread)}

2218
02:38:15,857 --> 02:38:21,428
JoJo...
{\ O (spread)}

2219
02:38:21,428 --> 02:38:27,000
JoJo!
{\ O (rank)}

2220
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:32,571
My final ripple...
{\ O (rank)}

2221
02:38:32,571 --> 02:38:38,142
My... dying wish is...
{\ O (spread)}

2222
02:38:38,142 --> 02:38:43,714
That you take my ripple
and continue on, JoJo!
{\ O (spread)}

2223
02:38:43,714 --> 02:38:49,285
He collapsed.
{\ O (spread)}

2224
02:38:49,285 --> 02:38:54,857
I’ll vanquish your wicked soul!
{\ O (spread)}

2225
02:38:54,857 --> 02:39:00,428
Drown in the murk of history, Tarkus!
{\ O (spread)}

2226
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Old man!
{\ O (spread)}

2227
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Mr. Zeppeli!
{\ O (spread)}

2228
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:09,500
If we lose you—
{\ O (spread)}

2229
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:10,000
There’s no time to be sad.
{\ O (spread)}

2230
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:10,500
The Stone Mask must be destroyed!
{\ O (rank)}

2231
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:11,000
Old man!
{\ O (spread)}

2232
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:11,500
I...
{\ O (spread)}

2233
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:12,000
I lived my own life to the fullest.
{\ O (spread)}

2234
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:12,500
In the end,
{\ O (spread)}

2235
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:13,000
I leave everything I have to you.
{\ O (spread)}

2236
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:13,500
JoJo,
{\ O (spread)}

2237
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
You are my hope.
{\ O (spread)}

2238
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:23,071
<i>Once again, life is
spilling out of my arms</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2239
02:39:23,071 --> 02:39:30,142
<i>You showed me my purpose</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2240
02:39:30,142 --> 02:39:37,214
<i>Who I am meant to be</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2241
02:39:37,214 --> 02:39:44,285
<i>You taught me that humanity’s
greatest gift is courage</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2242
02:39:44,285 --> 02:39:51,357
<i>The light you’ve given
to me will shine through</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:39:51,357 --> 02:39:58,428
<i>Into my spirit</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2244
02:39:58,428 --> 02:40:05,500
It felt like...
{\ O (spread)}

2245
02:40:05,500 --> 02:40:12,571
I had a friend and a son
in you at the same time.
{\ O (spread)}

2246
02:40:12,571 --> 02:40:19,642
From here on...
{\ O (spread)}

2247
02:40:19,642 --> 02:40:26,714
I live within you.
{\ O (spread)}

2248
02:40:26,714 --> 02:40:33,785

<i>Even this pain...</i>

<i>Even this pain</i>
{\ O (spread)}

2254

<i>My father left to me
what you leave to me now</i>
{\ O (spread)}

02:41:16,214 --> 02:41:23,285
<i>The golden light that

<i>It’s the one thing in my heart

2257
02:41:30,357 --> 02:41:37,428
<i>I embrace it tightly</i>

<i>And from this prison...</i>
{\ O (rank)}

<i>Humanity’s glow in the darkness</i>

{\ O (spread)}

2576
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
Speedwagon coolly withdraws.
{\ O (spread)}

2577
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:54,757
Thank you for coming
to today’s performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2578
03:03:54,757 --> 03:04:02,715
This is a public [streamed] performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2579
03:04:02,715 --> 03:04:10,672
Since it’s my and Zeppeli’s actor,
Hirose Yusuke’s, final performance,
{\ O (spread)}

2580
03:04:10,672 --> 03:04:18,630
We each wanted to say a
few words if you don’t mind.
{\ O (spread)}

2581
03:04:18,630 --> 03:04:26,587
Take it away, Mr. Hirose.
{\ O (spread)}

2582
03:04:26,587 --> 03:04:34,545
I had the honour of performing the double
cast role of Zeppeli. I am Hirose Yusuke.
{\ O (spread)}

2583
03:04:34,545 --> 03:04:42,503
Thank you for today.
{\ O (spread)}

2584
03:04:42,503 --> 03:04:50,460
The musical will close tomorrow, though.
{\ O (spread)}

2585
03:04:50,460 --> 03:04:58,418
This type of role has been
played by others before,
{\ O (spread)}

2586
03:04:58,418 --> 03:05:06,375
Although personally, I
found that to be relieving.
{\ O (spread)}

2587
03:05:06,375 --> 03:05:14,333
There have been many
things that led to this day.
{\ O (spread)}

2588
03:05:14,333 --> 03:05:22,290
So even now, I have a lot of
thoughts and a lot of emotions, but...
{\ O (spread)}

2589
03:05:22,290 --> 03:05:30,248
Aside from that, the fact that we
have come this far is really thanks to...
{\ O (spread)}

2590
03:05:30,248 --> 03:05:38,206
Each and every one of the cast members
on this stage, and the wonderful and skilled staff.
{\ O (spread)}

2591
03:05:38,206 --> 03:05:46,163
And foremost, the people
who came every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2592
03:05:46,163 --> 03:05:54,121
You’re not coming every day?
Well, every day—
{\ O (spread)}

2593
03:05:54,121 --> 03:06:02,078
Truly a lot of fans came
and filled the whole theatre.
{\ O (spread)}

2594
03:06:02,078 --> 03:06:10,036
I would like to think our performance’s
quality is thanks to your support.
{\ O (spread)}

2595
03:06:10,036 --> 03:06:17,993
Truly, you’ve made each member of
this performance happy. Thank you.
{\ O (spread)}

2596
03:06:17,993 --> 03:06:25,951
From the bottom of my heart,
{\ O (spread)}

2597
03:06:25,951 --> 03:06:33,909
Pow.
{\ O (spread)}

2598
03:06:33,909 --> 03:06:41,866
MAMORU: From the bottom of the heart, pow!
{\ O (spread)}

2599
03:06:41,866 --> 03:06:49,824
Well, I played the role of Jonathan
Joestar, I’m Matsushita Yuya.
{\ O (spread)}

2600
03:06:49,824 --> 03:06:57,781
Thank you for today!
{\ O (spread)}

2601
03:06:57,781 --> 03:07:05,739
Did you have fun, everyone?!
{\ O (spread)}

2602
03:07:05,739 --> 03:07:13,696
The best, hearing this is the best, yeah.
{\ O (spread)}

2603
03:07:13,696 --> 03:07:21,654
Uh, right. Really, tomorrow’s
truly the final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2604
03:07:21,654 --> 03:07:29,612
That curtain call will
be the grand finale, too.
{\ O (spread)}

2605
03:07:29,612 --> 03:07:37,569
I think that Shotaro will
do perfectly tomorrow.
{\ O (spread)}

2606
03:07:37,569 --> 03:07:45,527
I—are you worried?
{\ O (spread)}

2607
03:07:45,527 --> 03:07:53,484
Nah, it’s probably okay.
{\ O (spread)}

2608
03:07:53,484 --> 03:08:01,442
-I’m worried, so please do the speech instead!
{\ O (spread)}

2609
03:08:01,442 --> 03:08:09,400
-He’s—that’s in the past.
{\ O (spread)}

2610
03:08:09,400 --> 03:08:17,357
Yeah, no. Anyway I think he’ll be fine.
{\ O (spread)}

2611
03:08:17,357 --> 03:08:25,315
I wanted to voice some
personal thoughts here.
{\ O (spread)}

2612
03:08:25,315 --> 03:08:33,272
First off, as Mr. Hirose said before,
{\ O (spread)}

2613
03:08:33,272 --> 03:08:41,230
It’s been a long road to
arrive at our final performance.
{\ O (spread)}

2614
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:49,187
And I’m relieved that we made it.
{\ O (spread)}

2615
03:08:49,187 --> 03:08:57,145
Truly, I’m truly happy to
be on this stage. Thank you!
{\ O (spread)}

2616
03:08:57,145 --> 03:09:05,103
Back in February, right?
Opening night was delayed.
{\ O (spread)}

2617
03:09:05,103 --> 03:09:13,060
But when we made it to opening day,
{\ O (spread)}

2618
03:09:13,060 --> 03:09:21,018
At that curtain call, really, at that time,
the audience cheered and applauded a lot,
{\ O (spread)}

2619
03:09:21,018 --> 03:09:28,975
Which has continued up through today.
{\ O (spread)}

2620
03:09:28,975 --> 03:09:36,933
Truthfully, at that time, I was feeling, within
me, that we became something unforgettable.
{\ O (spread)}

2621
03:09:36,933 --> 03:09:44,890
Yes, that’s right. Truly,
thank you for everything.
{\ O (spread)}

2622
03:09:44,890 --> 03:09:52,848
For having supported us up to this point.
{\ O (spread)}

2623
03:09:52,848 --> 03:10:00,806
And to Mamo, who supported
me like a partner in this.
{\ O (spread)}

2624
03:10:00,806 --> 03:10:08,763
Isn’t it seriously amazing that
he did this role without a double?
{\ O (spread)}

2625
03:10:08,763 --> 03:10:16,721
MAMORU: It’s alright.
YUYA: No, it was wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2626
03:10:16,721 --> 03:10:24,678
Before you even started,
I almost cried when I saw your face.
{\ O (spread)}

2627
03:10:24,678 --> 03:10:32,636
Yeah, me too a bit! I got emotional!
{\ O (spread)}

2628
03:10:32,636 --> 03:10:40,593
MAMORU: Yes.
YUYA: Sorry, I had to excuse myself.
{\ O (spread)}

2629
03:10:40,593 --> 03:10:48,551
Excuse yourself...
{\ O (spread)}

2630
03:10:48,551 --> 03:10:56,509
YUYA: It wasn’t because of you or something like that that I left.
MAMORU: I get it.
{\ O (spread)}

2631
03:10:56,509 --> 03:11:04,466
Nah, you were really incredible.
Really spectacularly incredible.
{\ O (spread)}

2632
03:11:04,466 --> 03:11:12,424
MAMORU: Not at all.
YUYA: No, no, I’m sorry.
{\ O (spread)}

2633
03:11:12,424 --> 03:11:20,381
It might be unusual for a performer to say this,
but I truly respect you. Really, you’re wonderful.
{\ O (spread)}

2634
03:11:20,381 --> 03:11:28,339
MAMORU: No, no really.
YUYA: I thought he really rejected his humanity.
{\ O (spread)}

2635
03:11:28,339 --> 03:11:36,296
You were just that wonderful.
{\ O (rank)}

{\ O (spread)}

2637

MAMORU: Thanks.
YUYA: Yes. So then...
{\ O (spread)}

2638
03:11:52,212 --> 03:12:00,169
We’re not on the same stage
tonight as we were then, but—
{\ O (spread)}

2639
03:12:00,169 --> 03:12:08,127
From the first day of rehearsals until now, he’s
supported me, helped me improve, and encouraged me.
{\ O (spread)}

2640
03:12:08,127 --> 03:12:16,084
Shotaro too. I truly believe that without those
two, I would never have achieved this JoJo.
{\ O (spread)}

2641
03:12:16,084 --> 03:12:24,042
So, this has been my first time
acting in a double cast performance.
{\ O (rank)}

2642
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
Thank you everyone in the cast!
{\ O (spread)}

2643
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:40,666
It was wonderful. Thanks!
{\ O (spread)}

2644
03:12:40,666 --> 03:12:47,333
And above all, above all, truly,
thank you for being devoted like this!
{\ O (spread)}

2645
03:12:47,333 --> 03:12:54,000
Now to everyone at the theatre,
{\ O (spread)}

2646
03:12:54,000 --> 03:13:00,666
And everyone watching the stream,
I don’t know where the cameras are but—
{\ O (spread)}

2647
03:13:00,666 --> 03:13:07,333
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
{\ O (spread)}

2648
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
Thanks!
{\ O (spread)}

2649
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:17,272
I was already so relieved that
I could raise my voice today.
{\ O (spread)}

2650
03:13:17,272 --> 03:13:18,545
Yes, and tomorrow Mr. Hirose and I will
be watching the final performance together!
{\ O (spread)}

2651
03:13:18,545 --> 03:13:19,818
Everyone, do your best!
{\ O (spread)}

2652
03:13:19,818 --> 03:13:21,090
I’ll be giving it my all along with you!
{\ O (rank)}

03:13:21,090 --> 03:13:22,363
Everyone, make sure
to—what are you saying?
{\ O (spread)}

2654
03:13:22,363 --> 03:13:23,636
I’m doing it! I was
just getting to it, okay?!
{\ O (spread)}

2655
03:13:23,636 --> 03:13:24,909
I’m gonna watch it too!
{\ O (spread)}

2656
03:13:24,909 --> 03:13:26,181
Yeah, I’ll watch too.
{\ O (spread)}

2657
03:13:26,181 --> 03:13:27,454
Pardon me.
{\ O (rank)}

2658
03:13:27,454 --> 03:13:28,727
And so, please support everyone
