00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,180

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,680
I decided it was worth believing.

I have this record

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,080
I leave my will to those who will inherit it.

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
From now on I

15
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,800
Heading to the ruins in Mexico

18

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
That's why now

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,000
This record must be kept.

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,680

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Let's get back to the topic

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
As you all know,

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,480
This foundation is for the benefit of humanity.

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,520
It was established with the aim of providing support in a variety of fields.

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
On the surface

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Please listen carefully

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:48,240
I founded this foundation here in the United States and have branches all over the world.

33
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,880
It's to pursue the secret of something.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,520
What is that something?

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Stone Mask

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
The Foundation's true purpose is to uncover the secrets of the Stone Mask.

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,320
And today, I'm recording the story of the mask.

38
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,200
And the story of the golden spirit that was there

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
So that you can inherit it.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
It began in the 16th century

41
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,280
tribes of the central plateau of Mexico

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,880
The husband of the sun who speaks the voice of time

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Founded by a tribe of Ahtecs

44
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,080
I have the power of life, eternal power, eternal life in my hands.

45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
TRUE

46
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,160
What will become life next? I suck the blood of life, and life is power in my hands.

47
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
We are children of the sun

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But one day the tribe suddenly disappeared.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
All of this mystery lies in the Stone Mask

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This story is about the Stone Mask

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The strange fate of two boys and their adventure begins.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
To do this, first

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000

Ouch, the rain is on my heart

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I need to dry it quickly.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll warm you up, Hey Kelly

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I won't sleep until the morning today

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Wait a minute, what's that?

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Isn't that Basa?

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No one has gathered yet. No one has come.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, I'll be the first one there.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
wait a minute

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, I don't want to get involved with you, sir.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you selling, rich Basa, aristocrat.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm going to find some treasure.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This guy is an instant death

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a beautiful necklace, I'll take it.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There must be something good in this box

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is this, your evil mask, I don't need this

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My husband is pregnant and the baby is alive.

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Baby, I don't want to get involved with that

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Find something valuable, something valuable

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't have a nice ring?

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you doing?

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A person's misfortune is

81
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's about making someone happy

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000

This guy sells for more than the stab shop.

87

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000

Is this fate?

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I said it because it was trendy and sweet.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your mamma is

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It was Jodaba!

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I wish I'd offered that woman for sale to you!

196
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Oi!
{\ Original: Dio!}

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Dio!

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Can't you hear me?

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Dio!

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is it, Dad?

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is it medicine?

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't need medicine

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I have something important to tell you, come here

204
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Dio

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I've known for a long time

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Memories after I die

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's all about you, my only son.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This, this, accept

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Give

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Joestar

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's an aristocrat.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Moreover, Osotoyoshino

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He owes me a debt of gratitude.

215
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay?

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When I die, send that letter.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go to that guy

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They take care of me.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll be back at school

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's good.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Cut it properly and stick it on.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Dad

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you acting like a father now?

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Listen, Dio

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You are smart.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I won't lose to anyone

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Become the richest

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Dio!
{\ Original: Dio}

229
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How about girls?

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Ask yourself

231
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It keeps getting stolen

232
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I see

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Of losers

234
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Shake hands

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's hell now

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Nausea

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Still, my mother

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Be noble

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let go of your pride

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He hugged me

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey Dio

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Look up at the stars

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
My mother keeps saying that

244
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
died of illness

245
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
easily

246
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
There's nothing in general

247
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Not only will it be stolen

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What a star

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Do you have it?

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Is that sky blue?

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Nacho Star

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ugly, terrible father, loser, always a loser

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Under this murky sky, I continued to struggle and die

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's receive our inheritance now, it's all from our parents, let's go on a journey

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I still have nothing in my hands, so let's start from here

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Joestar, you have the sun in the sky

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's right, Joestar

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Your family is a doctor, but they're making money

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Your father is a good doctor

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What do you think?

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But it's an expensive hat

262
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Stop it, your mother gave it to you for your birthday.

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Stop

264
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What are you doing?

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Just because you're in front of a girl, you're trying to act cool

266
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, do you know who this is?

267
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If it was Jona from the Joestar family, he would be more ruthless.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
After all, this guy is Jona of the Joestar family.

269
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The rich aristocrats shouldn't just stand there and act all high and mighty.

270
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
what?

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hey, let's go

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Um, are you okay?

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Leave me alone

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
but

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I did it because I wanted to, not to be thanked by you.

276
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm aiming for true sincerity. You were a girl and I was having trouble with you, so I just stood up to you.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Someday I'll be able to win

278
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay, let's go

279
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Jonathan Joestar

{\ Original: Hey Danny, Danny}

You're Dio Brando!

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So you're Jonathan Joestar?

285
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Everyone calls me Chocho!

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Looking forward to working with you.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let me introduce you to my friend Danny.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's a very useful shape.

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It won't bite so it's okay.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
friend?

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Danny!

292
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What are you doing? I won't forgive you!

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I've been waiting for you, Diobrando.

{\ Original: Lord Joestar!}

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Come in. This is the mansion where you will be living from today onwards.

296
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What's up, JoJo?

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You must be tired from traveling all the way from London, Dio.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,760
From today onwards, you are part of our family. Please live your life just like our son, Jojo.

299
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes, I am grateful for Lord Joestar's actions.

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Hehehehe.

301
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Brand, this is Inspector Archer.

302
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,760
Police? Did something happen?

303
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,640
Yes, no, I've known Lord Joestar for a long time.

304
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
I heard Danny crying earlier.

305
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,480
It came over suddenly, so the teacher was surprised and it ended up hitting my leg.

306
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,520
Danny is an excellent watchdog for the Joestar family.

307
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,760
He’s a friendly creature, but
I’m sorry he surprised you.
{\ Original: He's quite friendly, but it seems he startled you.}

308
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,000
JoJo, enough about Danny.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
yes.

310
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
JoJo has lost his mother too—
and you both are the same age!
{\ Original: Jojo has also lost his mother, and they are the same age.}

311
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,300
Please get along well with each other.

312
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, let me show you to your room.

313
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,240
Mr. Brand.

314
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440

315
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,160

00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,720
See you, JoJo.

318
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,080

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,120
Don't touch my bag.

I like number one the most

330
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,820
I won't let anyone act intimidating in front of me.

331
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
I was just trying to carry it for—
{\ Original: I just try to be friendly}

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,320
What are you both doing?

333
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And one more thing—
{\ Original: One more thing}

I hate dogs.
{\ Original: I hate dogs}

The attitude of those who fawn over humans

The insects are running

337
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Don't let that stupid dog get close to me

338

We are

Terrified

I was wrong.

367
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
How many times has this happened?

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
This is the sixth time.

379
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
And maybe

380
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Be quiet

381
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Stretch your vagina

382
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
beautifully

383
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Supple

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
It's always

385
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
beautifully

386
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Don't forget

387
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>Under the guidance of
the goddess of familial love</i>
{\ Original: Under the Goddess of Self-Love}

388
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
Whatever happens

389
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
To be loved

390
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
As a proud aristocrat

391
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Harmful information

392
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
JoJo

393
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
nevertheless

394
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Is it sincere?

395
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Use of oneself

396
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
graceful

397
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120

398
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,120
The perfect supporter

399
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
Put away the girl's dishes

400
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
It's okay to eat

401
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
No meals

402
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Use

403
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Follow their example

404
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
I

405
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Embarrassing

406
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
You

407
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,120
I was spoiled

408
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
Such

409
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
My mother prepared it for me.

410
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I always tried to correct my preaching.

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You see, we are nobles of high birth.

412
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Always question philosophy and truth in your mind

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
There are two knights in English folklore.

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
One day, their master was
taken prisoner by the enemy.
{\ Original: One day, their master was taken prisoner by the enemy.}

415
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The enemy was afraid of the
two knights, who had great power.
{\ Original: The enemy feared the two knights' great power and made a condition.}

416
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
“If you two will be executed in her place,
I will guarantee the life of your master.”
{\ Original: If you are executed in his place, the Lord's life will be guaranteed.}

417
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Here's the problem for both of you

418
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
yes

419
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those two knights who gave themselves
up as prisoners to save their master;
{\ Original: Two knights sacrificed themselves to save their master and were taken prisoner.}

420
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Is what you see beyond the prison bars the mud in front of you?

421
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Or was it the stars shining above them?
{\ Original: Or is it the star shining above?}

422
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What do you think?
{\ Original: Which do you think?}

423
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Or the mud?
{\ Original: Stars or Mud?}

424
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I think I saw mud

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Why do you think so?

426
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
In the end, they had no choice
but to die for their master.
{\ Original: In the end, they have no choice but to die for their master.}

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If you're dead, you can't accomplish anything.

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So no matter how many plans I had, I felt I had to live and do something.

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
They were looking at the stars!
{\ Original: I think I was looking at the stars}

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You lived your life to the fullest, and your two noble names will be engraved in history.

431
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So

432
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
How you lived, how things happened, cherish that

434
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think they should have stayed
alive and done something!
{\ Original: In the end, they themselves have gained nothing.}

435
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That soul-dissolving powerlessness

436
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What they saw was the mud!
{\ Original: All they saw was mud.}

437
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
They teach us lessons about what we can do with our lives.

438
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
They were proud to the end, they were looking at the stars

439
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I think it teaches us how to live our lives.

440
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You are an aristocrat, you have what you have, you live by taking it.

441
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So isn’t it your responsibility to think
about what you’ll achieve with your life?
{\ Original: So, in order to fulfill that responsibility, shouldn't we think about what we can accomplish with our lives?}

442
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I

443
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
There’s no right answer to this question.
{\ Original: Neither of us have a right answer to this question.}

444
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Is that okay?

445
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
People live in the silence of fate, so they reach out their hands

446
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Are you seeing stars or mud? Call both justice.

447
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I stepped in next to him, the winner is Choma-san, Choma-san, the new champion!

448
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ta-da! I trained with Danny!

449
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Now, who will be the next to
challenge our champion, JoJo?
{\ Original: Who will be the next to challenge this champion?}

450
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A new face has just asked to join our game.
{\ Original: Everyone, be quiet! A new friend has just asked to join our game!}

451
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
His name is Dio Brando!

452
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How about getting to know your new friends by getting them involved in our games?

453
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Alright, let’s do it!
{\ Original: Okay! Let's do it!}

454
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The rule is if you get
hit in the face once, you—
{\ Original: The rule is that if you get hit by the cross section even once, you lose!}

455
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If this is the rule, I'll throw it away if I do it in London!

456
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Gong down!

457
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Go, Jar Jarz!

458
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
Yay!

459
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,760
What a movement!

460
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,000
I've never seen that before!

461
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,520
Wow, Charger!

462
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Can't get through!

463
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
perfection!

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I got in!

465
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Charger!

466
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Can't get through!

467
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Can't get through!

468
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Can't get through!

469
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What a wonderful opportunity!

470
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Dio! Dio! Dio! Dio!
{\ Original: Dio, Dio, Dio, Dio, Darstand!}

471
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Everyone, Mina

472
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think my finger went in his eye.
{\ Original: I think my finger got in his eye.}

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I lost because of a foul.

474
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm sorry I'm late today

475
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Dio was amazing!

476
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
How do you do that move?

477
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
everyone

478
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It hurts

Danny...
{\ Original: Danny}

480
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
For some reason, Dio is trying to trap me.

481
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It feels like he’s invading my life.
{\ Original: I feel like I'm being invaded more and more}

<i>Hey, Danny, my heart aches</i>
{\ Original: Hey Danny, my heart hurts}

483
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'm full of anxiety

484

<i>What if I were to die today?</i>
{\ Original: If I were to die like this}

485
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Will everyone cry?

486
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You're always warm

487
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>Thank you for staying by my side!</i>
{\ Original: Thank you for being by my side}

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
<i>If mum were still here,
would it feel this way?</i>
{\ Original: If I had a mother, would it be like this?}

489

Is this how you loved me?

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You're a little

491
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000

Oi! Thanks for bringing
my handkerchief back!

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Please excuse me for
grabbing it without permission.
{\ Original: Sorry for touching you without permission.}

498
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It doesn't matter, the stone mask was apparently excavated from an archaeological site in Mexico.

499
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Mexico...
{\ Original: Mexico}

500
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We bought it from a London art dealer,
around the time JoJo was born.
{\ Original: I bought it at an art gallery in London when Jojo was just born.}

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
On the way back,
we had a carriage accident.
{\ Original: On the way back, he had a carriage accident.}

502
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was the time your dear
father saved us, you know.
{\ Original: It was when your father helped me.}

503
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Are you interested in it?
{\ Original: Are you interested?}

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
In particular

JoJo is always out playing
with Danny, isn’t he?
{\ Original: Jojo always goes out with Danny.}

506
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Danny has a friendship and trust for Jojo.

Do you have a friend dog?

508
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I had bought Danny when JoJo was young.
{\ Original: I bought Danny when Jojo was little.}

509
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
At first, he was afraid
of unfamiliar people,
{\ Original: At first, I was still scared of unfamiliar places and people.}

510
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And he didn’t get on well with JoJo yet.
{\ Original: It didn't work out with Jojo either.}

511
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But one time, JoJo was drowning in a river.
{\ Original: But one time Jojo drowned in the river.}

512
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
My voice is all alone and no one can hear it

513
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Just as she was about to die, a shadow heard her scream and jumped into the river. It was Danny.

He dove in and saved JoJo’s life.

You're so smart

You have to separate the core properly before eating it.

533
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey JoJo, what are you carving over there?
{\ Original: Hey Jo John, what have you been digging up lately?}

Huh? It’s nothing.

It's so boring

When you say it like that, it makes
me want to see it even more!
{\ Original: If you say so, I really want to see it}

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that we can be proud of our sincerity,

733
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
If you don't control your mind more calmly,

734
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
To get it all.

735
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But...

736
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What’s that noise?
{\ Original: What's that sound?}

737
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Is there someone in the depolarizing furnace?

738
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Are they trying to get out?!
{\ Original: Are you trying to go outside?}

739
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
No!

Then Perseverance, times changed,

{\ Original: The population is growing to the point of overflowing,}

745
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
The praise showered on the arts and entertainment,

746
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
In a flow that no one can stop,

747
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Turbulent and dissolving development,

748
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The pinnacle of British culture

749
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
After the summit, it's downhill,

750
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Top runner,

751
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
human history,

752
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
human history,

753
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
human history,

754
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
human history,

755
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
human history,

756
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
After that it's downhill,

757
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Top runner,

758
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The judge will be counted,

759

Rondo piece with index finger,

760
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The port's days are filled with new and old,

761
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
A map of London with great ideas,

<i>Just like the current state of the country</i>
{\ Original: Just like the current situation in that country,}

Focusing on the darkness,

764
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The swaying curtains of Galta,

765
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Portobello,

766
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
A new market.

767
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Is that correct?

768
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
The one excavated from Mexico?
{\ Original: Stone mask unearthed in Mexico.}

769
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I think it was Mexico

770
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
It was quite a while ago...
{\ Original: It was a long time ago,}

771
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Until you clarify!

772
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yay!

773
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
But you're right, sir.

774
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Some gentleman’s wife
fell in love with it,
{\ Original: The gentleman's wife was very fond of him,}

775
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And bought it from me at a high price—
{\ Original: They bought it from me at a good price.}

776
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Okay, done.

777
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
We did it.

778
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Now, where could I find this gentleman—
{\ Original: And where is this gentleman now?}

779
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That seems a little suspicious.

780
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Who the hell are you anyway?
{\ Original: What are you all about?}

781
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That's rude.

782
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
My name is Sephiri.

783
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's a danshaku.

784
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I came from Italy to
 find the Stone Mask.
{\ Original: I came from Italy in pursuit of the Stone Mask.}

785
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
All the way from Italy?!
{\ Original: All the way from Italy?}

786
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I think they said he was a northern aristocrat.

787
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm just going to check the ledger,

788
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Please wait.

789
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Gratz.

790
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Let me give you a bit of advice,

791
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The sun will be setting soon.
{\ Original: The sun will soon set.}

792
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It’s better if you don’t
go beyond that street.
{\ Original: You'd better not cross that street.}

793
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It mists.

794
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Thank you for watching.

795
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:11,500
I don't want to reach for my suit and fall towards the red

796
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,800
Beautiful and dirty mix together and the night drinks pile up

797
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:30,200
Abandoned by resignation, I lean close to you and shake your hand

798
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:38,000
This darkness is different from other countries

799
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,600
Something is wrong. People are swaying in the river and being carried away.

800
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:53,400
Give me a warmth Kisaki Jack

Let's all gather here now, Jack.

803
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:19,800
In 1887, the Trafalda pair raised their voices in equality.

804
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:27,800
From afar, the rich look on and laugh at your profession and life

805

Accelerate steadily

00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,600
Let's all gather here now, Jack.

807

Let's all gather here now, Jack.

I got it! The one who snatched the fangs away was my most noble hero, Jonathan Joe Turner!

Full moon, spaceship, if public opinion falls, move forward into the future

812
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Is it today? Where is it here? On top of which castle?

813
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,400
Will I really be able to live here? New memories exist here now

814

Look again someday, you'll see, you won't find

Now here, a full moon, a spaceship, if public opinion falls, move forward into the future

with JoJo for the school newspaper?
{\ Original: Hey! Can I write about your friendship in the school newspaper?}

You were beautiful and sincere

I straighten my collar, thinking of my friend

830
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,400
You regretted your mistake of not wearing your collar.

831
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:14,400
In place of Tani, you supported me

832

Just the wind has come this far

If this is taking so long, I'm getting old.

It's still today

839
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,500

If we can solve this mystery, it might spark something new in the Japanese Language Society.

He's dead, and the moon has abandoned us. Damn it.

899
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Yeah, I'm gonna beat this guy up and drink now.

900
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,500
The only one

901
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,700
I threw that thing at you and trampled on you

902
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,000
I don’t bloody need it anymore!
{\ Original: I don't need it anymore}

903
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,300
My mother was killed by him, and everything was taken from her.

904
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,000
Can you endure it, Tia?

905
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
<i>How hellish that your blood
is flowing through my veins</i>
{\ Original: Your blood flows through my body in this hell}

906
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Punish this curse, take it all into your hands

907
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,500
Keep winning until the very end of humanity

908
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:47,000
Be prepared and take action

909
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Wear a mask and become a brand, father

910
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Sleep with the past in a perfect world

911
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Get it

912
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Tia

913
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Tia

914
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Tia

915
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
What happened to the medicine now?

916
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
What’s the matter, JoJo?
{\ Original: What's wrong Jojo?}

917
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
A letter from your father seven years ago.

918
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
The detailed document from your father's deathbed is here.

919
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Wow

920
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Let me see it.

921
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
My father and the girl are the same

922
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
You always brought medicine to my father.

923
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
What on earth are
you trying to say?!
{\ Original: What are you saying?}

924
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Answer me

925
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What on earth are you trying to say?

926
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Give me the medicine back!
{\ Original: Let me check this medicine}

927
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
JoJo

928
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
To examine this drug

929
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
to doubt our friendship

930
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Tia

931
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I swear to you in all sincerity and on the honor of your father, Mr. Brand.

932
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
My own innocence

933
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I’ll never speak of this again.
{\ Original: I swear to my father I'll never talk about this again}

934
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I swear to him

935
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Tia

936
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
A vow

937
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
A vow

938
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
A vow

939
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I swear

940
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
oath

941
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I swear to you, Tia

942
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Is there any honor in that lottery?

943
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Give me back that medicine

944
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Tia

945
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I won't let you near my father anymore.

946
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Changed to the core

947
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
We never had a friendship from the start

948
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I will protect JoJo

949
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's a misunderstanding, JoJo

950
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
It's a misunderstanding

951
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And

952
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
There's no evidence.

953
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It's just a guess

954
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
yes

955
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I hated my father

956
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Above all, I was suspicious

957
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I've become selfish

958
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
JoJo

959
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
JoJo

960
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
JoJo

961
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
What did you do, Tia?

962
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
no

963
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It's okay

964
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I can't pull anymore

965
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
A perfect world

966
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Get it

967
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Tia

968
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
father

969
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
What's going on, JoJo?

970
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Speaking out loud like that

971
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
father

972
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm going to London for a couple of days.

973
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Meanwhile, the doctors I hired

974
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I decided to provide perfect care.

975
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Except from them

976
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Please do not take this as medicine or tia.

977
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
but

978
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Let me do what I want

979
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I don't know why

980
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I

981
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I believe in my son

982
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
father

983
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
thank you

984
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
7 years ago

985
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This guy

986
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It reacted to my blood and activated

987
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Use this guy

988
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It was disguised as a research accident.

989
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Hey, your research will kill you

990
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:40,000
The time limit is tight, so prepare yourself and take off

991
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Looking up at the stars in search of a laxative

992
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Aiming for the end of the world, East End of London

993
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
This place I followed is in the mud

994
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Augustus Golito, where the plague comes

995
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
This place in front of me is the other side of the world

996
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
There's a reason we need to move forward

997
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Even if you lose this right hand, look at the stars

998
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's finally time to choose

999
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
This is me and the smell

1000
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Who will come wading through the sea?

1001
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The me of that time

1002
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:24,000
August Golito Devours Everything

1003
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Augustus Golito, the end of everything

1004
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I don't know what's come

1005
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There must have been something called "Shosan"

1006
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Kokosuku even devours it

1007
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
We are the Augurs

1008
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's no problem if you don't know the world

1009
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Just tell me a simple truth

1010
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Hey hey hey

1011
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
My cousin's son

1012
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This knife is sharp

1013
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm not going to get into the costume.

1014
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
If you tend to do that, you'll end up showing your innocence

1015
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I am Augustus Golito

1016
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It goes without saying that we are cheats

1017
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The have-nots take the haves

1018
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Life is an Auger

1019
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Even my heart was stolen

1020
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
It seems like it would be safe if we ran away first

1021
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
High Cattongaren

1022
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Augustus Gorrit

1023
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It can even take your life

1024
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't mind losing this finger

1025
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Augustus Gorrit

1026
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Our Imcrony

1027
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I have

1028
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You'll lose your fingers too

1029
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah, maybe just one person

1030
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Augustus Gorrit

1031
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Proud of that resolve and deceive

1032
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I've been looking for Quornini

1033
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Don't bluff

1034
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Give the rich boy a try

1035
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Wilder Meow

1036
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I even blew my belly out

1037
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The mood is also aligned

1038
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I ended up in the wrong town

1039
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Handling my end

1040
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Countdown

1041
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
3 2 1

1042
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
This Speed ​​Burgon was allowed, why didn't he kick with all his might?

1043
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I came here for the sake of my father.
{\ Original: I came here for my father.}

1044
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I thought you must have a father,
or mother, or siblings too.
{\ Original: That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.}

1045
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I didn’t want to do anything
to cause your father grief.
{\ Original: I don't want to do anything that would disappoint your father.}

1046
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I came here for your father.

1047
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That's why Kelsion thought you must have a father, mother, and siblings.

1048
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I came here for your father.

1049
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's why Kelsion doesn't want to do anything that would cause your father grief.

1050
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Tell me your name.

1051
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Jora, Joestar.

1052
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Joestar-san, please name the person playing the German role.

1053
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Be careful. They're tricky. Hey, treat your wounds.

1054
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
This Speed ​​Burgon will guide you to Minsei.

1055
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why?

1056
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I like you.

1057
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Foca Street

1058
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
O man of resolve,

1059
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Foca Street

1060
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Continue taking a look

1061
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You who see the stars in your heart

1062
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
O courageous one,

1063
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
With a courageous heart

1064
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Light up the darkness

1065
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
A complete cheers to Tsugatsugashin Sunland!

1066
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Cheers to this beloved destiny, this encounter!

1067
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Once the water is boiling, pour the water into the pot.

1068
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
The water boiled.

1069
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Pour water into the water.

1070
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The water boiled.

1071
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The water boiled.

1072
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
The water boiled.

1073
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
The water boiled.

1074
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
The water boiled.

1075
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
The water boiled.

1076
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
The water boiled.

1077
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The water boiled.

1078
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
The water boiled.

1079
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I can't help but drink alcohol

1082
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Shut up and don't come out

1083
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:18,000

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The case is different between you and me

1086
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Where am I looking, Tanchiki?

1087
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Nyahaha are you listening to this?

It's an interesting machine

1101

What

1108
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
What is this light?

1109
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000

Dead

1111
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
If you get stabbed in the head with this much force, it's only natural that you'll die instantly.

1112
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It's an ancient instrument of torture and murder.

1113
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Not dead

1114
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000

Thank you.
{\ Original: Thank goodness...}

That is what I mean.

1149
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,500
I'll tell you

1150
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,700
It's a story from when you were a baby

1151
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,000
Yes, this is my ring

1152
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,500
But no theft report was filed.

1153
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,200
A man was arrested for trying to put a ring into the seventh

1154
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,800
The ring was given to Sir Joster when he was betrothed to his wife.

1155
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,900
It was clear that this was a special pairing.

1156
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,700
Yes, this is the ring I made with my wife.

1157
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,100
Did you remember your wife today?

1158
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,200
He had tears in his eyes.

1159
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,500
I have caught the culprit

1160
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,000
Would you like to see me?

1161
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,100
Stealing something from a nobleman is a serious crime

1162
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,500
The punishment for fighting is certain.

1163
01:15:58,900 --> 01:15:59,700
Got it

1164
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,000
Hey, hey

1165
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,900
Don't complain, Brand.

1166
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Mr. Brando,
{\ Original: brand}

1167
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,300
Oh no, then

1168
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,900
Dario Brando is no lifesaver or anything.

1169
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,600
He's just a thief

1170
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,200
Sir Joster knew that.

1171
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,300
He adopted Dio.

1172
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,200
Why?

1173
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,100
I am moved to tears by the words and actions that followed today.

1174
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,200
Didn't he say this to you?

1175
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,900
This ring was given to me

1176
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,700
Yes, I said

1177
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:42,900
Uh, yeah

1178
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,800
It's not a lie

1179
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,100
This is what I gave to him

1180
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,500
He is innocent

1181
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:52,300
It's one half of your wife.

1183
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,000
yes

1184
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,800
This is yours

1185
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,100
Please give this ring to me and buy something for your family.

1186
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:03,700
Lord Joster, why did you do that?

1187
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:15,200
If I were suffering in poverty

1188
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,700
I would have done the same

1189
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:27,200
Yes, for the ones I love

1190
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:32,700
For the ones I love

1191
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,700
The stars in the sky are attracted to each other

1192
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:45,200
Soon, like a myth

1193
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:54,200
This light will clear the darkness

1194
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,800
Let us pray

1195
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,700
thank you

1196
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,000
You are too kind

1197
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,100
This villain is laughing inside

1198
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,400
Maybe so

1199
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
But think the other way around.

1200
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:26,800
From the music of destiny, people reach out to the stars

1201
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,800
Let's embrace that courage, that loneliness

1202
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:46,800
Pain is all connected

1203
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Everything has meaning

1204
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:02,800
I am prepared to believe in humanity.

1205
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
If it falls, you can't see it, you see.

1206
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,800
it is

1207
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,800
Someday it will shine

1208
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,800
Inherited and turned into gold

1209
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:29,800
I'm ready to keep believing

1210
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:48,800
Curse your fate

1211
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
I'm waiting for D.

1212
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,800
It can still be stopped

1213
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:10,000
- Lyrics, composition, arrangement, lyrics, arrangement, composition, arrangement

1214

1215
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
- I heard a strange rumor.

1216
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
- Floscia's man,

1217
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
- He reportedly broke the wall with his bare hands.

1218
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
- And then the man, in the morning sun,

1219
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
- It won't fit.

1220
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
- It disappeared.

1221
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
- It's the same as 30 years ago.

1222
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
- Just like back then.

1223
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
- In the wilderness of memory,

1224
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
- A smashed grass fire.

1225
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
- That sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean

1226
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
- It was blood red.

1227
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
- Full of passion,

1228
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
- I'm fascinated by the world of roads.

1229
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
- My respected father,

1230
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
- Crossed the seven seas.

1231
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
- Dear Father and Mother,

1232
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
- To my youth.

1233
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
The Stone Mask...
{\ Original: - The Stone Mask is from my hand,}

1234
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
- They took it all away.

1235
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
- Vowed vengeance,

1236
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
- To get it back,

1237
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:51,000
- Tomorrow for sure, tomorrow for sure.

1238
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
- I think about it day in and day out,

1239
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
-There's a saying that goes, "That's who he is."

1240
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
- Stone Mask, if you let me find it,

1241
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
- It will be irreversible.

1242
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
- This hand,

1243
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
- believe.

1244
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
- Young girl.

1245
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
- Young girl.

1246
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
- Did you come back from London?

1247
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
- I got the deciphering material.

1248
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
- Too bad, Dio.

1249
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
- Really.

1250
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
- You may not understand, but this is the truth.

1251
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
- I understand, girl.

1252
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
- That's the kind of guy you are.

1253
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
- I know this is selfish, but I have a favor to ask.

1254
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
- This is the last one.

1255
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
- Can you give me some time?

1256
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
- To the police,

1257
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
- Time for independence.

1258
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
- I,

1259
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
- I regret my life.

1260
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
- Born into a poor family,

1261
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
- I got ambitious.

1262
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
- I did something stupid.

1263
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
- Sin,

1264
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
- I was making amends.

1265
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
- Don't believe it.

1266
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
- His words.

1267
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
- picture?

1268
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
- Everyone has a dirty look on their face.

1269
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
- Let me introduce myself.

1270
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
- I'm Speed ​​Oagon, the busybody.

1271
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
- I've been in the dark sea since I was born,

1272
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I've seen a lot of bad guys.

1273
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
- So you can tell by the smell.

1274
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
- This one's a habit.

1275
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
- It smells like vore.

1276
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
- This guy is born evil.

1277
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
- Mr. Joestar, just hand it over roughly.

1278
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
- We already have the evidence.

1279
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,360
Dad, I heard the whole story.

1280
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,880
I decide to rest in the bedroom

1281
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,880
My son

1282
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:24,320
I don't want to see him get caught. That guy won't get caught.

1283
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:29,320
I was born with that fate

1284
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:39,200
I get it, Jojo. You'll get arrested, but at least...

1285
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:45,040
I want you to put handcuffs on me. We've been together for seven years.

1286
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,720
Be careful why

1287
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,640
Got it

1288
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,240
I'll put the handcuffs on

1289
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,640
Humans have limitations

1290
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:08,640
I've figured it out

1291
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:13,640
The more Oro blooms, the more

1292
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:18,640
The limits of life

1293
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:24,640
Hey JoJo, I'm so frustrated

1294
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:30,640
There's nothing in these hands

1295
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,640
The prison where I was imprisoned

1296
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:42,640
Covered in mud

1297
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:47,640
No matter how much I struggle, I can't see the stars

1298
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,640
My eyes are closed

1299
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,640
Do you understand that murky sky?

1300
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,640
These hands are crushing me, they can't reach me

1301
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:07,640
This beautiful blood that has been JoJo

1302
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,640
Even after vomiting, this blood won't go away

1303
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:16,640
So now is the time to break this cage

1304
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,640
Catch the Stars

1305
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,640
And I

1306
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,640
Mother

1307
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:46,640
Humans

1308
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,640
I'm quitting

1309
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,640
JoJo

1310
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,640
throat

1311
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,640
Okay.

1312
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,640
Shoot

1313
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,640
Shoot

1314
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,640
Shoot

1315
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,640
JoJo...
{\ Original: JoJo}

1316
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,640
Hey, doctor, call a doctor

1317
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:26,640
Dad, Dad

1318
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:49,640
Gradually, this is my dead mother's ring. I'll be happy if I come.

1319
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:57,640
Don't begrudge me the reason

1320
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:07,640
Maybe being strict with you made you feel unfair.

1321
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:18,640
Anyway

1322
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,640
Not bad

1323
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:47,640
Gradually, the end came in my son's arms.

1324
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:52,640
Oh my god

1325
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:57,640
It was definitely a mistake back then

1326
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,640
When you die, everything

1327
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Damn it, Mr. Joestar

1328
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I was always told to be sincere.

1329
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Always proudly

1330
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I said I'd save you

1331
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I was told I believed

1332
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I'm powerless to have been unable to protect you

1333
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
What is sincerity?

1334
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Dad, open your chest

1335
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
What are you proud of?

1336
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
What's the purpose

1337
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
<i>This Joestar blood
flowing through my body!</i>
{\ Original: The Joestar blood that flows through my body}

1338
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Always remained sincere

1339
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Be proud and understand yourself

1340
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Ready to cut through the dark wilderness

1341
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Look up at the stars and accept it all

1342
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Engrave this will in your mind

1343
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Be proud of your heart and shine golden

1344
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Let's become the future and send it to the stars

1345
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
The Joestar blood that flows through my body

1346
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Everything is connected and everything has meaning

1347
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Resisting this fate and sadness

1348
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
A single drop of courage

1349
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Police work is tough

1350
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
what up

1351
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That's the corpse

1352
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Dio's body is missing

1353
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
What?

1354
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Police Officer, get away from the window.

1355
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
What's up with this guy?

1356
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I'm back to life

1357
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Even though I was shot so many times

1358
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Be careful

1359
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Someone has a weapon

1360
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
No way

1361
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Dio!
{\ Original: Dio}

1362
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
stop

1363
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Shoot me

1364
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Don't help me

1365
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
quickly

1366
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I don't know

1367
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Just what's happening now

1368
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Jaja

1369
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Can you hear me?

1370
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
you

1371
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
JoeJoe

1372
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I am

1373
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I have gained such great power

1374
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
From Stone Mask

1375
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Your father's power

1376
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Do monsters create monsters?

1377
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Mr. Joestar!
{\ Original: Run, Mr. Josser.}

1378
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
That's how it works.

1379
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
There's nothing we can do about that monster

1380
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
How about it?

1381
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It's no wonder that God has lost some unknown ability from his brain.

1382
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So then

1383
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
If you completely destroy the head

1384
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Stop it

1385
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Look!

1386
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
more

1387
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's stronger

1388
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Turon...

1389
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,700
above ーーー!

1390
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:23,400
Poor, poor!

1391
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,400
Mr. Joestar!

1392
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,400
Just a little longer, just a little longer, I'll enjoy this wonderful power.

1393
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,400
I still don't know how far I can go!

1394
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
JoeJoe

1395
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,400
Oh, JoJo

1396
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:57,400
Stop your pointless struggle

1397
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,400
I told you!

1398
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:09,400
The more you try to come up with a plan, the more you realize there are limitations to what humans can do.

1399
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:16,400
Don't hide in the shadows of the curtains, come out

1400
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:23,400
You too will become my life!

1401
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:31,400
Dion! It's not strategy that will stop you, it's courage!

1402
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:38,400
You can't defeat him this day, Speedwagon, you run from the mansion!

1403
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,400
Joestar-san! Don't run away to the top!

1404
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,400
The running flames illuminate the darkness

1405
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,400
Come on up, Dion! I'm here.

1406
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:12,400
Are you inviting me, JoJo? Okay, you go first.

1407
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:18,400
Shining light on the running flames

1408
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:24,400
I will end you, your power, here

1409
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:31,400
It's no use, it's no use! Let's suck the life out of it

1410
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:36,400
Flickering flames, don't let them fall!

1411
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:41,400
Let's offer light to the other side!

1412
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,400
After you gave me your power

1413
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,400
Your back was always ahead of me

1414
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,400
You were always on my back

1415
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,400
My youth is with you

1416
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,400
Settlement in this era

1417
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,400
Jojo, the Joestar mansion burns down

1418
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,400
Under the map, everything is lost

1419
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:20,400
Burn everything except this life

1420
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,400
I'll finish you

1421
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:34,400
This is what Joestar must be thinking

1422
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:40,400
The stronger the firepower, the more the monster's recovery power can't keep up.

1423
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,400
More, more firepower

1424
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,400
But the flames have reached the roof

1425
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Damn it, Mr. Joestar

1426
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,400
Woolly

1427
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:21,400
Woolly

1428
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:33,400
This body is immortal, you are the only one who will die.

1429
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:45,400
How the goddess of Jillary shines

1430
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:50,400
Give me loving judgment in your heart

1431
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,400
I won't let go of this knife

1432
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,400
You're closed off, it's a knife.

1433
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
It's no use, I'm immortal

1434
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,400
Jillary

1435
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,340
The power of hell

1436
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:11,220
The Goddess of Giving Love Sways in Flames

1437
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,720
Apply equal force and justice

1438
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:26,320
This isn't how it should be, the sacred goddess

1439
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
The power of hell

1440
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Goddess of Giving Love

1441
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
The power of hell

1442
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Goddess of Giving Love

1443
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Can you hear me?

1444
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I can hear you

1445
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
in front

1446
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I told you about the Astika people.

1447
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
That is

1448
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
It was a 13th-century mistake, not a 16th-century one.

1449
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Even though we are in a position where we must accurately tell the story,

1450
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I'm very sorry.

1451
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Someone also said

1452
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I don't want to get old

1453
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
by the way

1454
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Did you take a proper break?

1455
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
good

1456
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I am a storyteller

1457
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I have been a witness to many different human situations.

1458
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And I kept saying

1459
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
I want all the acrylic stands

1460
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I completed it

1461
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Now

1462
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Shall we talk a little more?

1463
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
The story so far seems a bit like a fairy tale

1464
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It's definitely a reality

1465
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
And from here too

1466
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
So strange.

1467
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
At that time, the mansion was engulfed in flames and collapsed.

1468
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
But Joestar was alive.

1469
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I beat Dion.

1470
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But I lost everything

1471
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
after that

1472
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
3 days

1473
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
1 day

1474
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
2 days

1475
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
3 days

1476
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
4th

1477
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
5 days

1478
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
6th

1479
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
7th

1480
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
8th

1481
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
9th

1482
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
10th

1483
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
11th

1484
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
12th

1485
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
13th

1486
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
14th

1487
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
15th

1488
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
16th

1489
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
17th

1490
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
18th

1491
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
19th

1492
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
20th

1493
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
21st

1494
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
22nd

1495
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
23rd

1496
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
24th

1497
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
25th

1498
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
27th

1499
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
28th

1500
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
29th

1501
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
30th

1502
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
31st

1503
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
32nd

1504
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
33rd

1505
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
34th

1506
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
35th

1507
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
36th

1508
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
37th

1509
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
38 days

1510
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
39 days

1511
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
40 days

1512
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
41 days

1513
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
42 days

1514
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
43 days

1515
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
That's why I came!

1516
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Nursing is done well.

1517
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Please come back at a later date.

1518
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Are you okay?

1519
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Oh, wait a minute.

1520
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Sigh...

1521
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I am...

1522
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Huh...

1523
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
…

1524
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
…

1525
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
…

1526
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
…

1527
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
…

1528
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
…

1529
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
…

1530
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
…

1531
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
…

1532
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
…

1533
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I slept for three whole days straight.

1534
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Everyone in the mansion

1535
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Please stay calm now

1536
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
We've passed the peak, but it's still a tough time.

1537
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I'm glad you're alive

1538
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
You've been nursing me

1539
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
you

1540
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
No way

1541
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
But they look similar

1542
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Who said we look alike?

1543
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
To Elina Pendleton

1544
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
picture?

1545
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
It's been a while

1546
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Jonathan Joestar

1547
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Why?

1548
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
This is my father's hospital

1549
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I moved to India seven years ago.

1550
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I recently returned to Japan.

1551
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
It's really been a while

1552
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I was weak

1553
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I couldn't run to you

1554
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I was a young child.

1555
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I couldn't face you

1556
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
That voice remains unchanged

1557
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
These unchanging feelings

1558
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Vivid rebab

1559
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
The sky gets higher

1560
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Elina Jojos

1561
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
The joy of being there

1562
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The clouds are proud

1563
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
The wind is a little sweet

1564
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Erina!

1565
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
sorry

1566
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I relaxed and lost consciousness

1567
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
With my broken arm

1568
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I'll always support you

1569
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Eye to eye

1570
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
If you touch it, it's there

1571
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
A little courage

1572
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Continues into tomorrow

1573
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Hand in hand

1574
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Touch and there

1575
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Fate comes into contact

1576
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
forever

1577
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
My heart is trembling now

1578
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
overlap

1579
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Faintly attracted to each other

1580
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
A continuation of that day

1581
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
The two

1582
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
destiny

1583
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
yes

1584
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Meeting people is

1585
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Maybe it's decided by fate

1586
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Speedwagon is cool

1587
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!

1588
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
It's a misunderstanding!

1589
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Wait, it's the murderer

1590
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,000
The method was the same woman's throat.

1591
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Slash

1592
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:32,000
The method was the same woman's throat.

1593
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Slash

1594
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
That belly is a face

1595
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Ammo is the worst

1596
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
The identity of the synchronized person is completely unknown

1597
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I can't grasp the truth

1598
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I like you.
{\ Original: Like you}

1599
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Don't walk outside at night

1600
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Like you

1601
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Performance

1602
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Ah, it's already this late, I have to go home quickly.

1603
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,000
It's still this late

1604
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
But Jack the Ripper might show up.

1605
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Scary

1606
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
It's scary.

1607
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Now you're talking to him

1608
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
picture?

1609
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I played late into the night and got depraved

1610
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Who is it?

1611
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I like you

1612
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Because I was seen

1613
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I feel no pain, I have nothing to fear

1614
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Now that I've been reborn, I'll start my life

1615
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:54,000
If we don't heal the wounds, we need lives.

1616
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
And the fulfilling game is weak

1617
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Don't you want power?

1618
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I will bestow power and pleasure.

1619
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Humans are bound by Zennartaga and fear great evil.

1620
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
However, in rare cases, there are evil elites who have no Zennartagha.

1621
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Me, you, how about you come with me, Dio?

1622
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
What do you know about me?

1623
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Bokarsachak, you must be angry.

1624
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,000
A woman drowning in fun, a woman covered in happiness

1625
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Defeat more, fear no more

1626
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I will bestow power and pleasure.

1627
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Jack, no more worries, more pleasure in your hands

1628
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I have no fear

1629
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Bad Earth, how many times have I been zeroed out?

1630
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You come with me, Jack, Zalipa.

1631
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Take my hand, who are you?

1632
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Whether to look at the time or what to look at, there are enough words to

1633
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Welcome me, I can't reach you

1634
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I'm living my life, the sun is already gone

1635
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death Cut out death

1636
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:56,000
This world

1637
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,000
That stone gana

1638
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I want to believe that, like the others, I have become a powder keg.

1639
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I think so, yes

1640
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It's okay, it's okay

1641
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
let's go

1642
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
That

1643
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
what happened?

1644
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Who is it?

1645
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I've been here for a while now

1646
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Jonathan Joestar

1647
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
and Miss Elida Pendleton

1648
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,720
BGM

1649
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:05,480
I'm surprised I survived

1650
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:07,360
Is that Ishikamen's power?

1651
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,200
Ishikamen!

1652
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:11,200
BGM

1653
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:11,880
chance!

1654
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:14,720
BGM

1655
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,720
departure!

1656
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:16,720
BGM

1657
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,040
Ash

1658
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:19,160
BGM

1659
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,360
All Air

1660
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,880
BGM

1661
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:23,920
Not bad at all

1662
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:24,920
Death

1663
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,320
Are you getting worse?

1664
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:26,840
BGM

1665
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:27,600
What?

1666
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,120
A compound fractured arm

1667
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:29,800
BGM

1668
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,400
No pain

1669
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:34,040
I am Zeppeli bullet scale

1670
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,440
Courage alone is not enough to win

1671
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,160
Ishikamen's Power

1672
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:41,080
I'm on your side

1673
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,400
Breathing?
{\ Original: Control your breathing}

1674
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:45,760
<i>Breathing</i> created that power?!
{\ Original: Your breathing erased the pain}

1675
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:47,840
I'm on your side

1676
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,280
It's Jola San Jose.

1677
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,760
BGM

1678
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,120
there is nothing

1679
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:53,480
What did you do?

1680
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,800
Why did you say my name?

1681
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:59,080
Please ask your questions one at a time.

1682
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:00,760
I'll show you the answer

1683
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,200
Follow me

1684
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,000
Then

1685
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,320
Fate changes

1686
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,880
Whether to accept

1687
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,720
It's up to you

1688
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,160
What happens next?

1689
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,360
If this breathing occurs

1690
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:29,480
Let me show you now

1691
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,680
With a special breath

1692
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:43,960
Special endorsement

1693
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,720
The blood carries

1694
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:48,720
The body burns the bifnech

1695
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,240
Energy is generated

1696
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,360
The name is

1697
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,440
Hamon Energy

1698
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:12,040
The power of Hamon is transmitted

1699
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:15,880
This miracle happened

1700
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:19,640
This is the power of Hamon

1701
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,000
Breathing brings

1702
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
The power of blood

1703
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,640
Everyone has a blood flow

1704
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,720
It gives you just a little bit of energy

1705
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:35,760
Transporting nutrients

1706
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,520
Regulating body temperature

1707
01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:39,640
Hamon's power is that small energy

1708
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,760
Collected from the whole body

1709
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,360
What makes this possible is

1710
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,720
It's a rhythm of breathing.

1711
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,000
Breathing is the power of now

1712
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yes, the power of breathing

1713
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Yes I know

1714
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
This breath, both inside and out

1715
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
About the Stone Mask

1716
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
And about you and Dio

1717
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Dio

1718
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
The mask can only be worn by those who haven't changed.

1719
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Rio the Stone Masked Man

1720
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I still walk in the darkness

1721
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I travel the world

1722
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I followed the mask

1723
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
To destroy

1724
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Dio is alive

1725
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
If we don't fight

1726
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
If you don't destroy it

1727
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Jamon in your hand

1728
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Otherwise

1729
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
You and the world

1730
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Fate is in motion

1731
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I finally found it

1732
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
What do you mean, Dio?
{\ Original: Do you accept it?}

1733
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
This fate

1734
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Everything is lifted up

1735
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
That's it

1736
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
supermarket

1737
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
supermarket

1738
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
supermarket

1739
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,000
destiny

1740
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
fight

1741
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
That's my destiny

1742
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Me and Dio

1743
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
The individual body of the Stone Mask

1744
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Unlocking the unknown power of your brain

1745
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Turning humans into vampires

1746
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
it is

1747
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You must take blood energy from others.

1748
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
On the other hand, Hamon's power

1749
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
From your own bloodstream

1750
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
To draw out energy

1751
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Front and back

1752
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Same energy

1753
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Yeah

1754
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
In other words

1755
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
To remove this jamon

1756
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
What do you think I should do?

1757
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
I'm starting to understand

1758
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Hamon. Hit them with another kind of hamon and they'll shatter.

1759
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
And these energy waves have the same shape as sunlight.

1760
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,000
The power to defeat Dio.

1761
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Yes. Time is running out. Learn how to turn courage into strength.

1762
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Jojo, Dio.

1763
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Eina, I can't get you involved.

1764
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
I just want you to nod now.

1765
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I'll definitely come back to this place.

1766
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Is this the Hamon from JoJo?

1767
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
…

1768
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:24,000
The clouds flow, the wind leaves thoughts behind

1769
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:29,000
go around

1770
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I nodded.

1771
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:39,000
To your resolve

1772
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,000
In sadness

1773
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
<i>Stars are drawn together</i>
{\ Original: The stars are attracted to each other}

1774
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Guided by the destiny I love

1775
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Caught in the mud

1776
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I'm floating here

1777
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Left behind

1778
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Living the dream, waiting by the window

1779
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
For whom is loneliness

1780
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Even if it doesn't reach

1781
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Even if you're not attracted to me now

1782
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I want to scream

1783
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
To be me

1784
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You are attracted to each other

1785
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Always guided by fate

1786
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I weave the days together

1787
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Let's live

1788
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Looking up at the stars

1789
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
To this place

1790
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:22,000
You'll tell me someday

1791
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Stay proud

1792
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Accepting all of you

1793
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Destiny and Love

1794
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,000
So that we can call it that

1795
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
The stars are attracted to each other

1796
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Guided by the destiny I love

1797
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
The stars are attracted to each other

1798
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Wherever you are

1799
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I am me

1800
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Live on

1801
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Live on

1802
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Live on

1803
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Wang Chen, you're still alive?

1804
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
yes

1805
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,600
Ugh ugh ugh!

1806
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:03,300
Ah!

1807
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:03,800
Ah!

1808
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,300
Ah!

1809
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:04,800
Ah!

1810
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,800
Ugh ugh ugh!

1811
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,800
Hahaha!

1812
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,600
Ah!

1813
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:10,100
Ah!

1814
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:10,600
Ah!

1815
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:11,100
Ah!

1816
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:11,600
Ah!

1817
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,100
Ah!

1818
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:12,600
Haha!

1819
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:13,100
Ha!

1820
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,500
What is that power?

1821
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,000
Haha!

1822
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
No way, that Dio guy

1823
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
SPEEEEEEEE!

1824
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,500
Wagum!

1825
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,300
You are,

1826
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,600
I know too much about the Stone Mask's secrets.

1827
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,600
It's Agarmaru!

1828
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:31,600
Mr. Joestar!

1829
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:36,600
You were looking too!

1830
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,600
Because, because! Dio-sama said so!

1831
02:05:39,600 --> 02:05:42,600
I can lick your blood!

1832
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:47,600
Lick? Lick? Lick? Lick! Lick! Lick!

1833
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:48,600
Bello-san Joestar?

1834
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:53,600
Be careful JoJo, he's got some serious power.

1835
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
What's with this weird hat?

1836
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,600
Grace

1837
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:58,600
Let's eat!

1838
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:58,700
Huh?

1839
02:05:58,700 --> 02:06:01,600
Huh?

1840
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:03,620
My arms... flames

1841
02:06:03,620 --> 02:06:05,060
My arm...

1842
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:07,060
My arm...

1843
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:08,240
My arm...

1844
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:10,840
My arm...

1845
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:12,460
My arm...

1846
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:15,880
My arm...

1847
02:06:15,880 --> 02:06:17,380
My arm...

1848
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:20,120
My arm...

1849
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:21,280
My arm...

1850
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:22,540
My arm...

1851
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:23,940
My arm...

1852
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:25,360
My arm...

1853
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,160
My arm...

1854
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:27,760
My arm...

1855
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:30,760
me

1856
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:40,400
It was

1857
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:46,340
I got a new life

1858
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:49,880
Creating something that surpasses humanity

1859
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:57,540
If it's important, it's not here

1860
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:58,960
Or your body!

1861
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,940
It's hot! What's this?

1862
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:05,020
It's hot! It's hot!

1863
02:07:05,020 --> 02:07:06,620
Oh! Wait a minute!

1864
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:13,260
Amazing, JoJo

1865
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:17,380
You've mastered Hamon in such a short time.

1866
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:21,820
what up?

1867
02:07:22,780 --> 02:07:23,420
JoJo

1868
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:27,020
I lost my treasury

1869
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,340
So I wanted power

1870
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:32,860
But that

1871
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:35,540
Not the same as Dio

1872
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:36,620
To hurt someone

1873
02:07:37,220 --> 02:07:39,420
It is fundamentally different from the power that is obtained by stealing.

1874
02:07:39,780 --> 02:07:41,180
But it's the same power!

1875
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:46,980
There is a proverb in the northern country of Norway:

1876
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:50,860
The North Wind created the brave Viking

1877
02:07:52,580 --> 02:07:54,100
A harsh north wind blows

1878
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,700
Because I know the pain

1879
02:07:56,180 --> 02:07:57,740
A Viking with timber frame was born

1880
02:07:58,820 --> 02:07:59,820
Not like them

1881
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,420
You

1882
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,460
I know the pain

1883
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:05,020
pain

1884
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:12,900
The pain of losing a friend

1885
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:16,940
The pain of inheriting pride

1886
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:22,340
The pain of the person you want to protect

1887
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:24,700
Proof of Life

1888
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:27,220
Listen to the pain

1889
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:35,100
I was always told to be sincere.

1890
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:41,820
Always following my father's lead

1891
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:51,540
I still don't know if it's true sincerity

1892
02:08:52,540 --> 02:09:01,660
The Joestar's blood is hot and trembling

1893
02:09:01,980 --> 02:09:08,660
The daily routine surface is dyed in a glowing red darkness

1894
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:13,100
That tragedy repeats itself

1895
02:09:13,580 --> 02:09:16,900
Holding this pain

1896
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:19,820
Is it a matter of daily routine?

1897
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,100
It was something I discovered by chance.

1898
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:23,500
What?

1899
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:32,020
A wedge driven into the wilderness of memory

1900
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:39,100
Once upon a time, I crossed the seven seas with my father

1901
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:42,420
Quiet Shore Night

1902
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:46,500
That mask emits light

1903
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:53,540
58 of his comrades were killed.

1904
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:54,700
Severi

1905
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:59,940
A masked man comes

1906
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
It's the same as back then

1907
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
At this time, the morning sun of salvation shone

1908
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
It was my father

1909
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Illuminated by the red morning sun, my father disappeared

1910
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:24,000
My watch stopped then

1911
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Holding this pain

1912
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
I've been chasing

1913
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Don't repeat

1914
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Vow revenge

1915
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Don't make me sad

1916
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Tomorrow will shine

1917
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:48,000
With pain

1918
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
What you need

1919
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
The courage to own the pain

1920
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
and

1921
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Ready to shoulder the burden

1922
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
JoJo

1923
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
The thought

1924
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I haven't forgotten

1925
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
yes

1926
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I believe in the power of this question.

1927
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
let's go

1928
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:24,000
【applause】

1929
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
JoJo

1930
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Joestar

1931
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Aha

1932
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Dio

1933
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
One

1934
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Where are you?

1935
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Ah, here it comes.

1936
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Otsuchi

1937
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Red Asahi

1938
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
He won't splash blood on me.

1939
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
a

1940
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Pacara

1941
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
this

1942
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
T-The horse!!
{\ Original: This is a horse.}

1943
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
yes

1944
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
crackle crackle

1945
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Seriously?

1946
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
You're a horse too

1947
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,000
crackle crackle

1948
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,000
That guy

1949
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:22,000
That guy should be Yama-chan, the researcher finally got a grip on him.

1950
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Yeah yo yo, I'm off to pay off the accumulated debts

1951
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Represent the underworld AK Speed ​​is a detailed investigation by agreement

1952
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I'll be your guide, I'll show you the 16-bar showtime

1953
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
From London to the south, on the round land, we drove without rest in a carriage

1954
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I can see that I can go to the Imishie Toner

1955
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Nara, a city on the shore

1956
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Wind Knight's Road Natural Fortress Maru

1957
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Wind Knight's Road The true nature of the fate is Dio's hideout

1958
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,000
The joy of taking action while the Sun King is still around

1959
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
While the Sun King is still there, clean up every month

1960
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Dio, you're so good at playing with your life.

1961
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Dio, come tomorrow to you, we'll defeat the end now

1962
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Thank you Speed ​​Ago I appreciate it

1963
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
The inside information was accurate. It seems that Tranchen has escaped further ahead.

1964
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Dio will build his empire here.

1965
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
If we can find him while the sun is still out

1966
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Enter the tunnel. This is the entrance to the city.

1967
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Arrived on schedule

1968
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Hey, giant carriage, why are you stopping the carriage?

1969
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Be careful, the sun doesn't reach here

1970
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Escape from Tranchen

1971
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Look, horse, horse

1972
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
What is this thing?

1973
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
The horses also slipped in easily.

1974
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Your blood

1975
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I'll give it a taste.

1976
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Jota, you two stay back.

1977
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I will fight

1978
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
JoJo, fighting spirit.

1979
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
It's growing

1980
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
This insect is a giant human being.

1981
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I'm challenging you to a fight

1982
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
Can you call that courage?

1983
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
What are you talking about?

1984
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
What exactly is courage?

1985
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Disturbing breathing is scary

1986
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
If you overcome fear, your breathing will not become irregular

1987
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Ripple Cannon Attack

1988
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Goku is a product of courage

1989
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Human production is the production of courage

1990
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
The greatness of humanity is the greatness of courage

1991
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,000
No matter how strong

1992
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
These zombies don't know courage

1993
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Drinks and dollars

1994
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Dollars!

1995
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Hot! Hot!

1996
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
desire!

1997
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I can definitely kill you

1998
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
surely!

1999
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Pieces out!

2000
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
I'll eat it

2001
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Hidden passage in the tunnel

2002
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Window Light Lot

2003
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
This is the knights' training ground

2004
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I hear there are a variety of tricks

2005
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And there's a huge underground cemetery.

2006
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
He's inviting

2007
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Chasing makes you lazy

2008
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I'm sure Dio is up there

2009
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Dollars!

2010
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Can you hear me?

2011
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Sleeping Knights

2012
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Dollars!

2013
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Answer me

2014
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Tell the King Again

2015
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Let go of that grudge now

2016
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
It's erased history

2017
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Subverting justice

2018
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Win it all

2019
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
That's the world

2020
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Unwavering

2021
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
This Dio World

2022
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Dio's World

2023
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
The long silence

2024
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It has corrupted this country

2025
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Now is the time to speak up

2026
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
My throat has been blown

2027
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Scream from the mud

2028
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Drop that star

2029
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Let's allow that

2030
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Mytion!

2031
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Easy jewel!

2032
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Raise this voice

2033
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Rot in 300 years

2034
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Let it go behind you

2035
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Return in 300 years

2036
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
This one second

2037
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Wait, Dio

2038
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Come quickly, JoJo

2039
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
I am

2040
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I got my world

2041
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Dollars!

2042
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Kill them all

2043
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Dollars!

2044
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Destroy it all

2045
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Even life is controlled

2046
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Breaking God's Word

2047
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Controlling history

2048
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I'll learn everything anew

2049
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Controlling Time

2050
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Beyond Eternity

2051
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Heavenly Command

2052
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Rule them all

2053
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
It's been a while

2054
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Live to the fullest

2055
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Acknowledge all

2056
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Justice is justice

2057
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,000
A country of justice and ulterior motives

2058
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Beyond Eternity

2059
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Rule them all

2060
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Song weaving

2061
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Seeking kindness

2062
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,000
My World

2063
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
This world

2064
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Dio's World

2065
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Laughter

2066
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Ah, it melts

2067
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
The dead melt so fast

2068
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
My cheeks melted and holes appeared

2069
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
The tongue pops out of the hole

2070
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,000
There's a hole in my cheek

2071
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,000
A tongue is sticking out of the hole

2072
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Jack!

2073
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Oh, that's true.

2074
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Dio!

2075
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Protruding

2076
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
The fire went out

2077
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Your lives too

2078
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
It's time to sink

2079
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I've been preparing for that moment

2080
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,000
But it makes me feel good

2081
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2082
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:15,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2083
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:26,200
You are a man who cannot be forgiven, JoJo. You have a fighting spirit.

2084
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:36,200
Jojo Lessender The North Wind Created the Vikings

2085
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:41,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2086
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:49,200
The North Wind created the Vikings.

2087
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:59,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2088
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:08,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2089
02:21:08,200 --> 02:21:18,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2090
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:28,200
I have a fighting spirit. I broke a drop from the glass the other day. I can defeat them.

2091
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,200
Disturbed the universe

2092
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,200
A similar wind is blowing

2093
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,200
Wine Harmony

2094
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:40,200
I feel it

2095
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:43,200
Sing the Darkness

2096
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:45,200
The Serpent Gate Wave

2097
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,200
Resonate throughout your body

2098
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:49,200
Solar Universe

2099
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,200
Sing the Darkness

2100
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:56,200
My hands are shaking, Harmony

2101
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:02,200
Hautau fans will surely burn out

2102
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:04,200
Sunlight

2103
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,200
Yellow

2104
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:09,200
Over

2105
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
Don't do it

2106
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:17,200
Dollar Hive

2107
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,200
Wave Gate of the Sun

2108
02:22:19,200 --> 02:22:21,200
Dio

2109
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,200
This is the power that will defeat you

2110
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,200
Dio Frando

2111
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:32,200
I don't know you personally

2112
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:33,200
But

2113
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:36,200
Against the stone wall that awakened your brain

2114
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:38,200
I dare say

2115
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,200
for now

2116
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:43,200
You

2117
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,200
I dare to say to the stone wall

2118
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,200
We finally met

2119
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:50,200
Don't get on my head

2120
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:58,200
If I can heal this wound in my stomach

2121
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:01,200
JoeJoe

2122
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:07,200
It was attached to you

2123
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,200
What?
{\ Original: that}

2124
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:11,200
Fire injuries are detected

2125
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,200
With your lives

2126
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:19,200
I'll disinfect this wound with ultramarine

2127
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,200
you

2128
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:24,200
How many lives did that wound suck out of you?

2129
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,200
You

2130
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:37,200
Do you remember how many slices of bread you have eaten?

2131
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:46,200
I'll make you take root

2132
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,200
The blade of the sun

2133
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:52,200
bread

2134
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,200
Poor poor

2135
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:57,200
this is

2136
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,200
My arms are frozen

2137
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,200
The energy you radiate

2138
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,200
I thought it was blood related.

2139
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:04,200
I am

2140
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:07,200
You can control your body freely

2141
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:12,200
If you freeze your veins

2142
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,200
I can't use that power

2143
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:16,200
Don't disrupt your breathing

2144
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,200
Breathe

2145
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,200
Attack

2146
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:24,200
Waste, waste, waste, waste

2147
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:27,200
breathe?

2148
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,200
波紋?

2149
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:32,200
If you blow

2150
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:38,200
It would be fitting if they were playing a fanfare for me

2151
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:49,200
A poor friend that suits you

2152
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,200
What?

2153
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:51,200
fellow

2154
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,200
Yes.

2155
02:24:54,200 --> 02:24:55,200
Do you remember?

2156
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,200
Someday

2157
02:24:58,200 --> 02:24:59,200
Your father

2158
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
The story of the knight that my parents told

2159
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,000
what?

2160
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
16世紀

2161
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Plot to assassinate Elizabeth I

2162
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:13,000
The tragic queen sentenced to death

2163
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Mary Seward

2164
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I told there

2165
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Two people

2166
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
It's the story of a proud knight.

2167
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
My dad too

2168
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
yes

2169
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
We listened to it together, didn't we?

2170
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,000
JoeJoe

2171
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Dio

2172
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Today, this tradition is passed down in England.

2173
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Let's talk about two knights

2174
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
The spirit that descends downwards is alive

2175
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
A tale of knightly pride

2176
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
It was three hundred years ago

2177
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Two countries competing for support

2178
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Queen Elizabeth Suffers

2179
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Beautiful Mary Seward

2180
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
He gave the sword to Mary.

2181
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Two legendary heroes

2182
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Power with You

2183
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
It will happen again in the afterlife

2184
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Plaford Solo

2185
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Deliberate Heart

2186
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Shoot the shapeshifting enemy

2187
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Two people with no luck

2188
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I trained that strength

2189
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Looking for a stop

2190
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Finding comfort in Mary's self-love

2191
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Pledge your life

2192
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
But one day

2193
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Their mistress, Mary,

2194
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
By Elizabeth

2195
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
accused of murdering her husband

2196
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I'll be captured

2197
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
The two heroes are unstoppable

2198
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,000
To save Mary

2199
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
To stop the two heroes

2200
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Elizabeth calls out

2201
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Let your skin and blood live on

2202
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
I will spare my master's life.

2203
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:37,000
There's no way we could refuse

2204
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:42,000
We have no regrets

2205
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,000
For this dear queen

2206
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
But he was about to be executed

2207
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I'll tell you about the maid's souvenir.

2208
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Your master is not imprisoned.

2209
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
You and I lost our heads

2210
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,000
That's her lying here like trash

2211
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Let's keep him alive

2212
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Because there is a risk of rebellion

2213
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
You betrayed me, Elizabeth.

2214
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I will curse you with this grudge

2215
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Curse forever

2216
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:27,000
The anger of the Eighth End makes human flesh like iron

2217
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I can't get through that neck

2218
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Her hair got tangled around Plaford's chest.

2219
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Like a living thing

2220
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I lived with this in mind

2221
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Knight's Tale

2222
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
A strong smell that gives you goosebumps

2223
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
What a loyalty

2224
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
But they should have done better.

2225
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,000
In the end, I couldn't do anything in the mud

2226
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
It could be said that it was a pointless death

2227
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
You may be right.

2228
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
But nothing is meaningless

2229
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:16,000
The same goes for when you came to this house.

2230
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
It's all connected

2231
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I want to believe they continued to see the stars.

2232
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:28,000
People live in a prison called fate

2233
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Reach out your hand there

2234
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Are you seeing stars?

2235
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Or somewhere

2236
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Both

2237
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Joe John

2238
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Dio

2239
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Call it justice

2240
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:05,940
Hahahahaha... those two...

2241
02:30:05,940 --> 02:30:10,900
I made it into a weapon of revenge that can blow away even demons.

2242
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:13,640
Damn it...
{\ Original: I am...}

2243
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:18,040
Even history can be your servant!

2244
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:18,840
No way...

2245
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:22,160
Hahahahahaha...

2246
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,480
Hahahaha...

2247
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,060
Oh no...

2248
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:29,060
Hahahaha

2249
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:31,060
What is this appearance?

2250
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:33,060
To avenge a grudge

2251
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,060
What an embarrassing sight

2252
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:39,060
Don't you think so?

2253
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:41,060
Kill them all.

2254
02:30:43,060 --> 02:30:45,060
A continuation of that day

2255
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:47,060
Tarkus

2256
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:49,060
Braford

2257
02:30:49,060 --> 02:30:51,060
Let's scream "Fansfare"

2258
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:55,060
Above us

2259
02:30:55,060 --> 02:30:57,060
Our

2260
02:30:57,060 --> 02:30:59,060
Pride, the great wrestler Bruford

2261
02:30:59,060 --> 02:31:01,060
and Tarkus

2262
02:31:01,060 --> 02:31:03,060
Your thoughts and pride

2263
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:05,060
I can't imagine the resentment

2264
02:31:05,060 --> 02:31:07,060
But to me too

2265
02:31:07,060 --> 02:31:09,060
There's something I'm carrying

2266
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:11,060
We're the ones who'll eat this guy.

2267
02:31:11,060 --> 02:31:13,060
Cartilage

2268
02:31:13,060 --> 02:31:15,060
It's delicious

2269
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:19,060
The man's pride

2270
02:31:19,060 --> 02:31:21,060
I take it as a kiss

2271
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:23,060
My master

2272
02:31:23,060 --> 02:31:25,060
I'm in Braford

2273
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:27,060
The end of this brave man's life

2274
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:29,060
I want to draw

2275
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:31,060
Okay, that's good.

2276
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:33,060
Come on, it's a kiss duel

2277
02:31:37,060 --> 02:31:39,060
Run away, both of you.

2278
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:41,060
Joe Stan

2279
02:31:41,060 --> 02:31:43,060
Tarkus

2280
02:31:43,060 --> 02:31:45,060
I won't let you get in my way

2281
02:31:53,060 --> 02:31:55,060
a

2282
02:31:59,060 --> 02:32:03,060
In the wilderness of memory

2283
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:05,060
Hit

2284
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:07,060
smoking

2285
02:32:07,060 --> 02:32:09,060
Atlantic

2286
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:11,060
That morning sun

2287
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:13,060
It was red as blood

2288
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:19,060
Osa

2289
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:21,060
You're not coming

2290
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:25,060
ah

2291
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:29,060
Fuck

2292
02:32:29,060 --> 02:32:31,060
Fuck

2293
02:32:31,060 --> 02:32:33,060
I can't do anything

2294
02:32:33,060 --> 02:32:35,060
I'm already grateful

2295
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:37,060
I don't have anything

2296
02:32:37,060 --> 02:32:39,060
I'm powerless

2297
02:32:39,060 --> 02:32:41,060
Wait a minute

2298
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:43,060
Don't mess with me, even at a time like this

2299
02:32:43,060 --> 02:32:45,060
Even if you give up, it still hurts

2300
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:47,060
Continue to deceive

2301
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:49,060
Tomorrow for sure

2302
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:51,060
Tomorrow for sure

2303
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:53,060
you

2304
02:32:53,060 --> 02:32:55,060
Like I'm alive

2305
02:32:55,060 --> 02:32:57,060
I kept chasing

2306
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:59,060
Let's make a tragedy

2307
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:01,060
Is revenge your identity?

2308
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:03,060
Is that your pride?

2309
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:05,060
What if

2310
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:07,060
Fight for your pride

2311
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:09,060
and

2312
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:11,060
If we win

2313
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,060
I hope you win

2314
02:33:13,060 --> 02:33:15,060
What is your heart now?

2315
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:17,060
Let me shake it off

2316
02:33:17,060 --> 02:33:19,060
It's not the pain that's scary

2317
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,060
What you should know

2318
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:23,060
regain

2319
02:33:23,060 --> 02:33:25,060
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow

2320
02:33:25,060 --> 02:33:27,060
Tomorrow and now

2321
02:33:27,060 --> 02:33:29,060
Osa

2322
02:33:35,060 --> 02:33:37,060
Melt

2323
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:39,060
I came along to die

2324
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:41,060
Speed ​​moves

2325
02:33:43,060 --> 02:33:45,060
Now my heart

2326
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:47,060
Let me shake it off

2327
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:49,060
Look at you

2328
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:53,060
Someday tomorrow

2329
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:55,060
Don't wait

2330
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:57,060
I start walking

2331
02:33:59,060 --> 02:34:01,060
Should believe

2332
02:34:03,060 --> 02:34:05,060
Should be reclaimed

2333
02:34:07,060 --> 02:34:09,060
Tomorrow

2334
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:11,060
now

2335
02:34:17,060 --> 02:34:19,060
I'll carve it

2336
02:34:19,060 --> 02:34:21,060
Blood Beat

2337
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:27,060
you

2338
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:29,060
Please bring back that proud heart

2339
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:33,060
I am

2340
02:34:33,060 --> 02:34:35,060
Black Knight

2341
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,060
Branboard

2342
02:34:37,060 --> 02:34:39,060
I like this

2343
02:34:39,060 --> 02:34:41,060
pain

2344
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,060
Why doesn't it work?

2345
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:53,060
You just said pain

2346
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:55,060
You are feeling pain now

2347
02:34:57,060 --> 02:34:59,060
pain

2348
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:07,000
So I stopped fighting with you

2349
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
So you stopped the sword

2350
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
You are a proud knight

2351
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Human

2352
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
The pain

2353
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Proof of Life

2354
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Is this a human?

2355
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Because there is pain

2356
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
I can feel the joy of being here now

2357
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
A strange sense of peace

2358
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I feel now

2359
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Bravo

2360
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Let me make you follow the words engraved on my sword

2361
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Good luck

2362
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And courage

2363
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:22,000
To save souls

2364
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,000
That I have to kill

2365
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:28,000
you

2366
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Queen Queen

2367
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
No way

2368
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Defeating the Black Knight

2369
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
also

2370
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:53,000
You are this Dio

2371
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Hey Baby

2372
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
The plant's jamon attack will tempt you.

2373
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
what

2374
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:09,000
More vulgar than a frog's argument

2375
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Hamon

2376
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
It's dangerous

2377
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,000
A knight's disgrace

2378
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,000
What's the point of not repaying your grudge?

2379
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:37,000
What is joy?

2380
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Queen

2381
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Queen

2382
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Queen

2383
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Victory!

2384
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Victory is our pride

2385
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Damn it

2386
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I'll do it

2387
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Let's do it

2388
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Queen

2389
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
my

2390
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
The last jamon

2391
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Follow me

2392
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
My will

2393
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Queen

2394
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Collapse

2395
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I'll destroy that evil spirit.

2396
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Sink into the darkness of history

2397
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Tarkus

2398
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Old man

2399
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Mr. Jepel

2400
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Mr. Jepel

2401
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
When you're gone

2402
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
If you are sad

2403
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Stone Mask

2404
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Destroying

2405
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Old man

2406
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
When you're gone

2407
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
If you are sad

2408
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Stone Mask

2409
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Destroying

2410
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Old man

2411
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Old man

2412
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I

2413
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I'm satisfied with my life

2414
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
lastly

2415
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
My everything

2416
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
I entrusted it to you

2417
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Chocho

2418
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
You

2419
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
It's my hope

2420
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Old man

2421
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,000
this

2422
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Life spills out of my arms again

2423
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:20,000
You taught me my meaning and my destiny

2424
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:32,000
He taught me that the greatness of human beings is courage

2425
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:44,000
The light I receive will permeate my heart

2426
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:52,000
It was like having a best friend and a son at the same time.

2427
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:57,000
From now on I will live inside you

2428
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
thank you

2429
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Everything is connected, everything has meaning

2430
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:23,000
This pain that I believed

2431
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:29,000
This pain

2432
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:42,000
What your father entrusted to you, what you entrusted to him

2433
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:51,000
The golden light inside me

2434
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:07,000
There is one certain thing that I want to release in my heart right now

2435
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Embrace it and escape from this prison

2436
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Seeing the stars, the golden heartbeat, the brilliance of humanity

2437
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I'll light up the darkness and come to you

2438
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:50,000
My hands to you

2439
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,000
girl

2440
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Okay, okay.

2441
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Can't you hear my voice, my voice calling out to you?

2442
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I can't hear it, I've already killed the past

2443
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Don't call me by my name, I'm not like you

2444
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Death has broken it, my son.

2445
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:11,000
It has been reborn, it remains the same, in order to live

2446
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I'll use it all and entrust justice to you.

2447
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Win all, rule all

2448
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I want something next, something I want

2449
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:52,000
What I want is that is that is that is

2450
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Lyrics, composition, arrangement, and arrangement

2451
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Here it comes...JoeJoe...

2452
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Is this the world you wanted?

2453
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
what?

2454
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Is the world you lost long ago a pitiful one, surrounded by dead people like this?

2455
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
It's a wonderful world where I control everything. Even death and history...

2456
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
And to do so, do we rob innocent people?

2457
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:03,000
It's a noble sacrifice for the future I envision.

2458
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:15,000
You're just scared. Humans... that's why I stopped being human.

2459
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:25,000
To obtain it, he went beyond humanity.

2460
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I just ran away.

2461
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,000
All that matters is the results.

2462
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:47,000
The only outcome is that I win and dominate...

2463
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:51,000
It's all destined to be like that!

2464
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:52,000
different!

2465
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
It's about how you lived.

2466
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:05,000
What have you left behind by resisting fate?

2467
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
This symbol is...

2468
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:27,000
He gave me strength and then died.

2469
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:39,000
It's your father!

2470
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
That's right...

2471
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
It's something I can't do in all seriousness, but...

2472
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
The current Jonathan Joos...

2473
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
To get revenge!

2474
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I will kill you!

2475
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
You're the same too!

2476
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
That's how you get rid of your grudge!

2477
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
No! You've been in denial!

2478
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I will take over!

2479
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Speed ​​out!

2480
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
It's crap in my mouth...

2481
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Now you don't have it...

2482
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Dear Joes!

2483
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Squeeze it, that life is also at my disposal...

2484
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,000
I've lost so much...

2485
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
But the light shone.

2486
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
A purified, tainted arrow...

2487
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
That's what I lived for...

2488
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Waste, waste, waste!

2489
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
The blur breaks!

2490
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Waste, waste, waste

2491
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:55,000
To take everything

2492
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Set this heart on fire

2493
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Gained power

2494
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
This pain will ease

2495
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:07,000
If you think about it, you are me

2496
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:10,000
You've been both sides of the story

2497
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Child's Ice

2498
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Burning my body

2499
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Kill me

2500
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Kill me

2501
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Zettel told me

2502
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Using the sword as a medium, I will pour feathers into you.

2503
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Yay!

2504
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Defeated Diou

2505
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
That's not right.

2506
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Stupid Tomoka

2507
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
This is a sword

2508
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,000
緊弱緊弱

2509
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Don don don

2510
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
It's a little tense, but I can feel your pulse

2511
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Now you too can be part of my night

2512
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
thief

2513
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:07,000
What a monkey! You ran away from humans after all.

2514
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Why aren't you freezing me right now? Diou!

2515
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Just by being hit by this death, I have surpassed humanity

2516
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,000
You can't keep up

2517
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,000
You're a monkey, girl

2518
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:26,000
No! If there are people who die

2519
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I'll search for that heart

2520
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Even humans grow

2521
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,000
As long as we are human

2522
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,000
If you wish for that, you can stop it

2523
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Like earth and ice

2524
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:48,000
I will sacrifice my life to prove my worth

2525
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
Like earth and ice

2526
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Like earth and ice

2527
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Like earth and ice

2528
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Even the people I've connected with

2529
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Like earth and ice

2530
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:12,000
I will sacrifice my life to prove my worth

2531
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Diow! Diow! Diow!

2532
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,000
How many times have I come?

2533
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
I like Number One

2534
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
My eyes!

2535
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
It seems the original dream has entered his eyes.

2536
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Until I lose you

2537
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I'm gonna hit you now

2538
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
I won't stop

2539
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
That's stupid

2540
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
My body is hot

2541
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Melting

2542
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
be destroyed

2543

There was more

2546
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
He broke his eye and released his own bodily fluids.

2547
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Dear Dio,

2548
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000

02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Jonathan?
{\ Original: Jongran}

2581
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
John Starr got married

2582
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
The other person is

2583
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
The Pendleton family

2584
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Spirit woman

2585
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Erina Pendleton

2586
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
Honeymoon begins the next day

2587
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
A long-term battle in America

2588
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
A little news

2589
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
John Starr

2590
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I wish you both happiness

2591
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I will always support you

2592
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
When you stop, wherever you are

2593
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I'm going to rush over.

2594
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Harnemoon

2595
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
I'm looking forward to the look up story

2596
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
America is great

2597
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Someday I will too

2598
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
I want to dig up some bills in America.

2599
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Shikusho

2600
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
And after this

2601
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
The fateful moment arrives

2602
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
This story will be shared by the world.

2603
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Continue speaking until uniformity is achieved

2604
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
That's this busybody

2605
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
It's a job introducing Speedwagon.

2606
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
But now

2607
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Speaking

2608
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
It's not me

2609
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Boo

2610
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Boo

2611
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Eternal

2612
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Today

2613
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Offer a prayer

2614
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Among the circling stars

2615
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
my

2616
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
this

2617
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:06,500
My hands are always touching yours

2618
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
What's wrong?

2619
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,000
I'm happy you're here

2620
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:21,000
It's the same for me, I wanted you to meet your father.

2621
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,500
Let's go eat

2622
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:27,500
Jonathan!
{\ Original: Jonathan}

2623
02:55:27,500 --> 02:55:28,500
That's...

2624
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:32,500
Erina, I'm back in the guest room.

2625
02:55:33,500 --> 02:55:35,000
Don't forget to lock the door

2626
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:52,500
I brought him with me.

2627
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,500
My Body

2628
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Are you here?

2629
02:55:58,500 --> 02:55:59,500
Dio

2630
02:56:00,500 --> 02:56:01,500
JoJo

2631
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:07,000
I dare to expose this pathetic state of myself to you

2632
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:13,000
I used to underestimate you, but now I respect you

2633
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Because I realized that

2634
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,000
If God controls destiny

2635
02:56:22,500 --> 02:56:26,000
There's no relationship as calculated as ours

2636
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:31,500
I got this power because of you

2637
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Because you were there

2638
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:39,000
I don't have it all

2639
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,000
How far have you...

2640
02:56:42,500 --> 02:56:45,000
That's why this is destiny

2641
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:52,000
I'm the only person in this world I respect, and I've got a human body.

2642
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Living a glorious eternity

2643
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,000
JoJo

2644
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
We are in this world

2645
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Two people are one

2646
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Lord Dio! Look! Look! Look! Please look!

2647
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
JoJo!

2648
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:22,000
From light to darkness, this is where my myth begins

2649
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Let's end it all and start it all

2650
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Don't destroy Dio's world, JoJo

2651
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Dio!

2652
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
There are keys that don't make any sound.

2653
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Only you can take a deep breath

2654
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
The myth begins

2655
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:48,000
The ship is in danger of slowing down.

2656
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Only this one!

2657
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,000
help me!

2658
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:53,000
help me!

2659
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Beat them to death?

2660
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Or do you enjoy being a knight?

2661
02:57:58,000 --> 02:57:59,000
completely!

2662
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Don't give yourself, cut off your head

2663
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,000
My friend Yamagami-san will not tolerate insults.

2664
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I'll steal you

2665
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:18,000
That blood will become my servant

2666
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Connecting to the future

2667
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:27,000
The last feather left

2668
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:35,000
Just die.

2669
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Run!

2670
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Something inside me broke

2671
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Something decisive

2672
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
JoJo!

2673
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
This is it!

2674
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,000
Run away

2675
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
No, JoJo

2676
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:06,000
With you

2677
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Until it burns

2678
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:14,000
Everything is everything

2679
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Until it disappears

2680
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Flames run

2681
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Everything is connected

2682
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Live for me

2683
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Everything is connected

2684
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:32,000
It's okay if you cry

2685
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:37,000
You will inherit this fate

2686
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:42,000
The flag of loneliness also grew

2687
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Be happy

2688
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
I'll live

2689
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Who will win in the end?

2690
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Dead Flower

2691
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Be happy

2692
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
I'll live

2693
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:05,000
JoJo!

2694
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:11,720
It's about you

2695
03:00:13,780 --> 03:00:15,480
Before my consciousness melts

2696
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:18,720
I thought you were coming.

2697
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:19,680
Let go

2698
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:21,680
Let go, JoJo!

2699
03:00:29,080 --> 03:00:29,760
This guy

2700
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Dead

2701
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:01,800
It's about you

2702
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:04,800
Before my consciousness melts

2703
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:06,800
I thought you were coming.

2704
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:08,800
Let go, JoJo!

2705
03:01:09,800 --> 03:01:14,800
His proud life

2706
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:18,800
Vanished beyond the customer

2707
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,800
The destiny and adventure

2708
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:28,800
It's undecided

2709
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:31,800
Will continue to be spoken of forever

2710
03:01:34,800 --> 03:01:36,800
Heart of Gold

2711
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:40,800
When I sing

2712
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:48,800
Two in One

2713
03:01:49,800 --> 03:01:51,800
A strange friendship

2714
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:53,800
feel

2715
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:55,800
I agree

2716
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:57,800
Yo

2717
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:00,800
Without you

2718
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:03,800
Because you were there

2719
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:05,800
Hey

2720
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:06,800
JoeJoe

2721
03:02:06,800 --> 03:02:09,800
Now I

2722
03:02:10,800 --> 03:02:14,800
Keep watching the stars

2723
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:21,800
Guided by the destiny I love

2724
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:26,800
Reaching for the stars

2725
03:02:27,800 --> 03:02:32,800
The two of us, our destiny

2726
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:34,800
Becoming One

2727
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:36,800
music

2728
03:02:37,800 --> 03:02:38,800
Quietly

2729
03:02:39,800 --> 03:02:40,800
From the world

2730
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:43,800
One saw the stars

2731
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:45,800
During the tour

2732
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:47,800
The stars shine

2733
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:50,800
The mud pulsates

2734
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:53,800
One saw the mud

2735
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:55,800
Go away

2736
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:57,800
With you

2737
03:02:57,800 --> 03:02:58,800
With you

2738
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:01,800
Light

2739
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:03,800
Lighting

2740
03:03:04,800 --> 03:03:07,800
Let the wind blow tonight

2741
03:03:08,800 --> 03:03:09,800
Everyone is shaking

2742
03:03:10,800 --> 03:03:11,800
In the darkness

2743
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:13,800
Ride the Shadows

2744
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:16,800
Transcend time

2745
03:03:17,800 --> 03:03:18,800
The world

2746
03:03:19,800 --> 03:03:20,800
expensive

2747
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:22,800
Getting tired

2748
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:28,800
Calling the Name of Time

2749
03:03:29,800 --> 03:03:30,800
With you

2750
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:32,800
With you

2751
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:34,800
The stars

2752
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:36,800
The stars

2753
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:39,800
shine

2754
03:03:40,800 --> 03:03:42,800
mud

2755
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:44,800
teeth

2756
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,800
Speedwagon is

2757
03:03:47,800 --> 03:03:48,800
Cool!

2758
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:49,800
With you

2759
03:03:50,800 --> 03:03:51,800
The stars shine

2760
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:54,800
I saw mud

2761
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:20,800
Lyrics, composition, arrangement, and arrangement

2762
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,800
【whale】

2763
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:08,000
I'm really happy that I've been able to gradually get involved in this way.

2764
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:12,000
So please take this opportunity to say a little thank you to your teacher.

2765
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:16,000
Thank you so much, Dr. Araps, for gradually disrupting things.

2766
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:24,000
And thank you to my childhood friend Imamura.

2767
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000
thank you.

2768
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:36,000
Now, please, Mr. Koo.

2769
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:46,000
I had the opportunity to play Inspector Archer. My name is Yabatsu Kou.

2770
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:58,000
This is my first time performing in such a big musical, and musicals are the best.

2771
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Is it possible to be this happy?

2772
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:18,000
This time in particular, I was able to do something that I personally will never be able to experience again.

2773
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Well, I got to see everything that the staff were doing behind the scenes,

2774
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Even today, when I watched it, all sorts of things kept going round and round in my head, and I was constantly moved.

2775
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:43,000
This musical is really moving, isn't it?

2776
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Really.

2777
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
I'm so glad.

2778
03:11:50,000 --> 03:12:01,000
To everyone here in the theater, to all the performers, to all the staff,

2779
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I'm really grateful to all the staff.

2780
03:12:03,000 --> 03:12:08,000
Thank you so much for supporting this reset, this moving fortress.

2781
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:20,000
And, especially for us, this time we were reminded once again that the greatest source of nourishment is the smiles of our customers, as seen here.

2782
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:24,000
It was a lecture that really made me feel that very strongly.

2783
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:32,000
I am truly happy that I was able to give such a miraculous lecture all the way to the end.

2784
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
Thank you very much.

2785
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:44,000
【applause】

2786
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:48,000
Now, Mr. Kong, please. Thank you.

2787
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
Thank you very much.

2788
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:55,000
Great staff, great cast.

2789
03:12:55,000 --> 03:13:02,000
And thanks to everyone who came to the theater and everyone who watched the film,

2790
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:07,000
We have now made it through the viewing process and are now able to reach the final performance today.

2791
03:13:07,000 --> 03:13:10,000
I am truly happy.

2792
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:14,000
And, best of all, he was very supportive.

2793
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
thank you.

2794
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:22,000
And, above all, my son was doing his best as a single man.

2795
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:25,000
【applause】

2796
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
That's amazing.

2797
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:30,000
Thank you very much.

2798
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Thank you, Dad.

2799
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:36,000
The person who raised him wasn't wrong.

2800
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
I'm really happy.

2801
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:43,000
And then, thank you for your greeting earlier, Kouchi-san.

2802
03:13:43,000 --> 03:13:45,000
They really supported this play.

2803
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Thank you very much. Thank you so very much.

2804
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:54,000
Everyone, please check out Kouchi's Proud Funding page.

2805
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,000
thank you.

2807
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:01,000
【applause】

2808
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:03,000
Now, we're all connected.

2809
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:05,000
We're connected.

2810
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:07,000
See you at the next theater.

2811
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:09,000
Thank you very much.

2812
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:13,000
【applause】

2813
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
Get rich.

2814
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Get rich.

2815
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:18,000
[Laughter]

2816
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,000
Get rich.

2817
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
Thank you! Thank you!
{\ Original: thank you.}

2818
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:24,000
[Laughter]

2819
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
Now, Miisa-chan, please.

2820
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:27,000
yes.

2821
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
The hurdle has become even higher.

2822
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:30,000
[Laughter]

2823
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:33,000
I'm not sure if I can speak it well though.

2824
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:36,000
This is Shimizu Miisa, who plays Erina Pendle Ton.

2825
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:41,000
【applause】

2826
03:14:41,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Thank you so much for joining us today.

2827
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:48,000
And thank you to everyone who watched the stream.

2828
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,000
What should I say?

2829
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:58,000
It was really thanks to the strength of each cast member and the staff that we were able to get to this great war settlement.

2830
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
And this work.

2831
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:05,000
I think it's all thanks to everyone who supported me.

2832
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:15,000
Please come everyone

2833
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:26,000
Please look at the stars

2834
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:33,000
That's it

2835
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
So, Dice, please

2836
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:37,000
yes

2837
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Speed ​​Mode Role Dice

2838
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
Um

2839
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
It was my first experience

2840
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:51,000
It was really hard for me

2841
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:53,000
But really

2842
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:54,000
Yeah

2843
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
It was really hard though

2844
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:57,000
Already

2845
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:59,000
To get support

2846
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:00,000
Like supporting them.

2847
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,000
Words like "support each other"

2848
03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:06,000
It really feels like it's going straight into your body.

2849
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
It's a really nice spot

2850
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Thanks to that

2851
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
I was able to get through it.

2852
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:13,000
in

2853
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:16,000
I can only say the best

2854
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
With everyone here on stage

2855
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
This person also said,

2856
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:21,000
I'm not standing on this stage

2857
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,000
Although he's not here today

2858
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:26,000
And all the staff who helped create it

2859
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:27,000
and

2860
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:30,000
For the past 5 months

2861
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
I really appreciate that we were able to be together.

2862
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:35,000
I want to make it a treasure in my life.

2863
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:36,000
Um

2864
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
Please love JoJo

2865
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
Thank you for taking an interest in Speedwagon again.

2866
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
Including everyone who loves me

2867
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,000
Thank you very much

2868
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
Huh

2869
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Ladies please

2870
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I'm Toyama, and I supported the role of Cheppeli.

2871
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
Today

2872
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
Ceppeli

2873
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:05,000
Cheplisen

2874
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:07,000
Ceppeli

2875
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:08,000
Nice to meet you again

2876
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:11,000
To everyone attending the Great Athletes' Music Performance and those watching the live stream,

2877
03:17:11,000 --> 03:17:13,000
Thank you very much

2878
03:17:15,000 --> 03:17:17,000
If you really think back

2879
03:17:17,000 --> 03:17:18,000
that

2880
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:21,000
There were a lot of different things that happened.

2881
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:22,000
Two people from JoJo

2882
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:25,000
Shotaro-kun and now Yuya-kun, who finished here yesterday

2883
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,000
And another Cheppeli

2884
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Hiro-kun

2885
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:29,000
And alone

2886
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:30,000
I've done this much

2887
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:33,000
Led by Mamo-kun, this company is united as one.

2888
03:17:33,000 --> 03:17:36,000
With the determination to make it a success

2889
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:39,000
This great player came here with the aim of becoming Rakugo.

2890
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:42,000
Yes, without calling anyone

2891
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,000
I've been able to come this far

2892
03:17:43,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Of course, the dedicated support of all the staff

2893
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000
It is the result of your efforts.

2894
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:52,000
I only do half of each stage,

2895
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:55,000
Every single performance was met with thunderous applause.

2896
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:56,000
5000 yen

2897
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:57,000
Um, us

2898
03:17:57,000 --> 03:17:58,000
The cast now is

2899
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:01,000
It's really the energy of your ripples.

2900
03:18:01,000 --> 03:18:03,000
How much courage it gave us

2901
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:06,000
I think we all really feel that way.

2902
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:07,000
That's really true now.

2903
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:10,000
I was there for almost six months, almost five months.

2904
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:13,000
It really is like a family

2905
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:16,000
It's already today and tomorrow will be a valley

2906
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,000
Hey hey

2907
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:19,000
valley?

2908
03:18:19,000 --> 03:18:21,000
It's a sweet story

2909
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:24,000
Well, let's just leave it as a casual acquaintance.

2910
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
Just a little bit

2911
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
I feel a little lonely though

2912
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:31,000
The world of JoJo that I really love

2913
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
And with my favorite members

2914
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:39,000
I found a group of people who breathed the same air as me at the theater.

2915
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:40,000
Your hearts

2916
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:43,000
Bang, that was it.

2917
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
It has become my treasure

2918
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
I am proud to have been able to do this with you all.

2919
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:51,000
Thank you very much everyone

2920
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,000
thank you

2921
03:18:53,000 --> 03:18:55,000
I want to finish again

2922
03:18:55,000 --> 03:18:57,000
Blacks

2923
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
Teacher, please

2924
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
good job

2925
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,000
I'm Tetsuya Bessho, who co-starred with Joestar.

2926
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
Thank you for today

2927
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
I am overwhelmed with emotion

2928
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:23,000
I have been involved in a lot of different works.

2929
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:27,000
This work is exactly as the title suggests.

2930
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:30,000
It was a strange adventure.

2931
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:31,000
hey

2932
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:33,000
Really

2933
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:35,000
As some of you may know,

2934
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:38,000
Born at the Imperial Theatre at the opening of Haran

2935
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:42,000
The current Imperial Theatre is closing.

2936
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:45,000
It will be the last new work

2937
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:49,000
I participated without tears.

2938
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:51,000
My friends are cast members here.

2939
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
It is staff

2940
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
And the original author

2941
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:58,000
The collectors and the people of the East

2942
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,000
It took five years

2943
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Apparently the script was rewritten 17 times. This work was born out of this process, and has now been well received by everyone, and is now coming to an end.

2944
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:22,240
There are many musicals, including works from overseas, and such works, such as Coordinate Zero, are on Broadway or in the West End, and we are here in Japan,

2945
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:38,240
We will be screening the film for a thousand days and ten thousand days, amplifying it greatly and in a very Japanese style, but I believe that what you have seen this time is a work that has become a coordinate axis, going from zero to one.

2946
03:20:38,240 --> 03:20:48,240
This work may be taken over and performed again someday, but I hope that my colleagues here at Zero One on this coordinate axis will

2947
03:20:48,240 --> 03:20:55,240
I really love them all and feel like they are all my sons and daughters.

2948
03:20:58,240 --> 03:21:15,240
There was only one difference. We both have the same father, and as a father, I would like to continue to tenaciously survive in the musical world as a friend who drinks mud and stars together, both pure and murky.

2949
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:32,240
I am so grateful to have two wonderful sons like this, and today, you may be watching me somewhere, but my son is also Yuyaku.

2950
03:21:32,240 --> 03:21:36,240
I was able to take part in a truly wonderful production as a father.

2951
03:21:36,240 --> 03:21:48,240
If you have any worries, I hope you will just think that in the end, everything is connected within you, and that everything has meaning.

2952
03:21:48,240 --> 03:21:56,240
I hope this work will make you think that there is surely light and stars beyond. Thank you very much.

2953
03:21:56,240 --> 03:22:04,240
【applause】

2954
03:22:04,240 --> 03:22:07,240
Now, Mambo, please.

2955
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:16,240
【applause】

2956
03:22:16,240 --> 03:22:20,240
I don't know where to start, really.

2957
03:22:20,240 --> 03:22:31,240
But anyway, I'm glad I met you. Really.

2958
03:22:31,240 --> 03:22:43,240
【applause】

2959
03:22:44,240 --> 03:22:54,240
We try to provide entertainment, but sometimes it's tough.

2960
03:22:54,240 --> 03:23:02,240
Well, it's scary sometimes.

2961
03:23:02,240 --> 03:23:12,240
But, as Dice said earlier, it's not just about supporting each other in the literal sense,

2962
03:23:12,240 --> 03:23:23,240
This company made me realize that this is what it means to truly support one another.

2963
03:23:23,240 --> 03:23:34,240
Of course, there were a lot of things that happened.

2964
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:45,240
Those are the only words I can express right now, but I want to express more than that.

2965
03:23:45,240 --> 03:23:58,240
I was able to hold it as a treasure, and more than anything, I was able to share it with so many people.

2966
03:23:58,240 --> 03:24:02,240
[Laughter]

2967
03:24:02,240 --> 03:24:07,240
【applause】

2968
03:24:07,240 --> 03:24:12,240
Having people enjoy themselves is what makes us happiest.

2969
03:24:12,240 --> 03:24:21,240
I am happy to have been able to experience this with these members.

2970
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:29,240
Jojo's brother passed away last week, but as his father said just now,

2971
03:24:29,240 --> 03:24:39,240
I think we will continue to look forward and pursue various forms of expression in our own individual ways.

2972
03:24:39,240 --> 03:24:44,240
It's still going to be useful.

2973
03:24:44,240 --> 03:24:46,240
[Laughter]

2974
03:24:46,240 --> 03:24:53,240
【applause】

2975
03:24:53,240 --> 03:24:55,240
We'll definitely meet again.

2976
03:24:55,240 --> 03:24:59,240
And I think it would be great to see them again in this JoJo.

2977
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:08,000
It's all connected

2978
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:14,000
I too dream of such a day, and today I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.

2979
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,000
Thank you everyone

2980
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:28,000
I'm going to say something really nice.

2981
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:37,000
I think it will tighten up nicely.

2982
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
thank you

2983
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:43,000
I'm Seitaro Arisa, the person who investigated Jonah.

2984
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:53,000
I don't know if you all really noticed,

2985
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:57,000
Because this is the kind of person I am

2986
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:01,000
Even if I stand in the middle, everyone

2987
03:26:01,000 --> 03:26:05,000
A lot of people really supported me.

2988
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:08,000
He was like a warm older brother to me.

2989
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,000
People who are like family

2990
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:13,000
That's fine for you, so just be yourself

2991
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:17,000
Those words alone have really brought me this far

2992
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:21,000
However, when I look around me,

2993
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:23,000
This time everyone

2994
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:29,000
I've seen the faces that look like they're in pain

2995
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:31,000
Really everyone

2996
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,000
The curtain won't open

2997
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:37,000
I think I may have caused a lot of anxiety.

2998
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:40,000
That voice is reaching me directly, too.

2999
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:44,000
However, I also received a lot of criticism from the people around me.

3000
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:50,000
I received a lot of messages asking me what was going on.

3001
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:52,000
But I

3002
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,000
I really believe in everyone

3003
03:26:57,000 --> 03:27:00,000
I've already seen everyone working hard here.

3004
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:04,000
I feel like I should just watch it.

3005
03:27:05,000 --> 03:27:07,000
Just please wait for me

3006
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:11,000
That's really the only feeling I have.

3007
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:15,000
We've all overcome so many big obstacles together

3008
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,000
Even if we don't have any more conversations

3009
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000
It's an invisible bond

3010
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:24,000
It's like we're becoming more and more connected through these things.

3011
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
I've been feeling it ever since the rehearsal studio.

3012
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,000
After all, open the curtain like this

3013
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:33,000
The other Yuya who plays Jonathan Josser

3014
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:38,000
We've really talked about a lot of things up until today.

3015
03:27:39,000 --> 03:27:42,000
Yesterday I was watching Yuya's War Village and Hiro's War Village.

3016
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:44,000
After all,

3017
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:46,000
It was there today

3018
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:47,000
One more

3019
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:52,000
I felt like I had really completed it.

3020
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:55,000
I've seen some really amazing things

3021
03:27:56,000 --> 03:27:58,000
I'm glad I worked hard after all.

3022
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:00,000
I really felt that way as of yesterday.

3023
03:28:01,000 --> 03:28:03,000
Today, everyone was so

3024
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:05,000
Seeing your happy face

3025
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:10,000
I am truly filled with joy from my heart

3026
03:28:11,000 --> 03:28:12,000
As I had originally thought,

3027
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:14,000
I think I was able to witness a historic moment.

3028
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:16,000
World Garden

3029
03:28:17,000 --> 03:28:19,000
We all really worked hard to create this

3030
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:21,000
already

3031
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
Well, starting with Koishi-san

3032
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
Koishi-san raised the flag and we all felt like we should follow him.

3033
03:28:27,000 --> 03:28:29,000
I'm trying my best to climb the hill, climb, climb

3034
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:34,000
I think I was able to really make everyone happy today.

3035
03:28:35,000 --> 03:28:36,000
Thank you so much

3036
03:28:43,000 --> 03:28:47,000
I also spoke without really thinking about it.

3037
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:52,000
Maybe some of you think that's not the case.

3038
03:28:53,000 --> 03:28:56,000
This is definitely my feeling

3039
03:28:57,000 --> 03:28:58,000
The company's feelings

3040
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:02,000
I may be overconfident today, but

3041
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,000
I think I've made everyone happy already.

3042
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:19,000
It's okay to think that

3043
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:31,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also provided support here.

3044
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:38,000
I can be proud of the fact that I also supported them.

3045
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:45,000
Everyone did their best.

3046
03:29:50,000 --> 03:29:51,000
Yuya

3047
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:53,000
Iro-san

3048
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:55,000
thank you

3049
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:08,740
【applause】

3050
03:30:08,740 --> 03:30:11,640
I used this to cut the river.

3051
03:30:11,640 --> 03:30:12,980
[Laughter]

3052
03:30:12,980 --> 03:30:19,680
Also, in front of everyone

3053
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:23,080
So that we can meet as JoJo

3054
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:27,880
And in the future, this work will not only be limited to Japan

3055
03:30:27,880 --> 03:30:29,880
I wish I could stay in the world

3056
03:30:29,880 --> 03:30:33,880
[Laughter]

3057
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:35,880
Embracing big dreams

3058
03:30:35,880 --> 03:30:37,880
I would like to close today

3059
03:30:37,880 --> 03:30:38,880
[Laughter]

3060
03:30:38,880 --> 03:30:40,880
Thank you very much

3061
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:46,880
【applause】

3062
03:30:46,880 --> 03:30:48,880
Well, I hope to see you again

3063
03:30:48,880 --> 03:30:50,880
Today is truly a day

3064
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:52,880
thank you

3065
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:55,880

Thank you so very much

Everyone...I said everyone.

3119
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:41,000
They're not friends.

3120
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:43,000
Mina...Mina-chan.

3121
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:44,000
Not everyone.

3122
03:35:46,000 --> 03:35:48,000
Thank you everyone!

3123
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:55,000
We'll definitely see each other again!

3124
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:57,000
thank you very much!

3125
03:35:58,000 --> 03:35:59,000
thank you very much!

3126
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:07,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3127
03:36:08,000 --> 03:36:09,000
Sorry sorry.

3128
03:36:11,000 --> 03:36:12,000
be careful!

3129
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:29,000
